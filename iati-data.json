The political will to end AIDS is receding as governments deal with multiple challenges including nationalism, populism, conflict and instability. These challenges contribute to increasingly polarised societies. However, globally there are still 38 million people living with HIV and in 2019 there were 1.7 million new infections.\n\nKey population groups (such as LGBTQI+ people, sex workers, people who use drugs) and their partners, and adolescent girls and young women are most affected by HIV, and account for the majority of new infections. Globally, the total number of new HIV infections has hardly declined for several years, stagnant at 1.7 million since 2018. This is far above the UNAIDS target of 500,000 per year by 2020 and reflects a worsening picture.\n\nIn 2019, for the first time, key population groups and their partners accounted for the majority (62%) of all new infections worldwide. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa, regions where the epidemic is expanding, key population groups accounted for almost all new infections.",

Donors assume that improved service delivery by the authorities will lead to a strengthened social contract between the population and the authorities, which will in turn lead to increased stability. The Netherlands contributed to SDF phase I with EUR 5 mln and based on satisfactory results during the previous phase and the fact that the SDF is the preferred support mechanism for the Somaliland authorities, now intends to increase the contribution for the coming years.",

Les deux \u00c9tats f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s (Jubaland et Sud-Ouest) b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront aussi de l\u2019appui donn\u00e9 durant l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux d\u2019infrastructure. Les activit\u00e9s du projet consisteront essentiellement en la construction et la gestion d\u2019infrastructures d\u2019alimentation en eau et d\u2019assainissement, ainsi que la fourniture de services li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019eau. Toutes ces prestations cr\u00e9eront des emplois, contribuant ainsi, dans une certaine mesure, \u00e0 l\u2019atteinte de l\u2019ODD 8, qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi d\u00e9cent pour tous.

Les tarifs et les redevances sur l\u2019eau seront revus, et int\u00e9greront des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tels que les tarifs minimaux, afin de permettre aux personnes en plus grande difficult\u00e9 d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux services d\u2019approvisionnement en eau. Les dossiers d\u2019appel d\u2019offres feront obligation aux entrepreneurs de respecter les normes fondamentales du travail et d\u2019assurer des formations de sensibilisation au VIH/sida, \u00e0 l\u2019intention de leurs employ\u00e9s et des communaut\u00e9s environnantes. Les personnes d\u00e9plac\u00e9es et les rapatri\u00e9s vivant dans les zones du projet profiteront aussi de ces interventions. Des \u00e9tablissements scolaires choisis b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront d\u2019installations am\u00e9lior\u00e9es d\u2019alimentation en eau et d\u2019assainissement, de la formation en hygi\u00e8ne et de la sensibilisation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.

Somalia suffers from the consequences of severe economic infrastructure destruction, high unemployment rates, a lack of technical skills and the erosion of the livelihood asset base of the Somali people. Somalia\u2019s economy urgently requires technology and skills transfer as well as a substantial increase in access to technical and vocational training opportunities. In addition, there remains an urgent need to address gender inequality in terms of access to employment and livelihoods. This project aims to contribute to these ends through the creation of short and long-term jobs through improving access to technical vocational skills for under skilled and underemployed youth in particular women.; and strengthening the quality of, and access to, vocational training opportunities. The project focuses on the creation of activity \u2018packages\u2019 that are interconnected and designed to enhance the overall effectiveness and impact of the project. The project has a strong focus on local level ownership of project activities \u2013 both at the governmental and community level \u2013 and the building of local capacities to ensure the sustainability of project initiatives.",

Zu diesem Zweck soll ein Insider-Netzwerk von engagierten Personen aus der Zivilgesellschaft gegr\u00fcndet und bef\u00e4higt werden, Mediation, Dialog und andere friedensrelevante Arbeiten vor Ort durchzuf\u00fchren. Zudem werden Workshops mit Akteuren der regionalen Verwaltung abgehalten, um ihr Bewusstsein f\u00fcr Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Frieden und Konflikten sowie Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf Konflikte zu sch\u00e4rfen und ihre F\u00e4higkeit zur Reaktion auf Konflikte auszubauen. Weiterhin werden in verschiedenen Distrikten Galmudugs gro\u00dfe Versammlungen im Rahmen des Gemeindedialogs organisiert, auf denen die Gemeindemitglieder lokale Konflikte und andere einschl\u00e4gige Fragen er\u00f6rtern und gemeinsam L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr diese Konflikte entwickeln k\u00f6nnen. Es wird 1-2 Mal im Monat ein regionales Radioprogramm produziert, in dem Friedens- und Konfliktthemen in verschiedenen Formaten diskutiert werden und an dem Zuh\u00f6rer aktiv teilnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Schlie\u00dflich werden die Anerkennung der Klimakrise und ihrer Auswirkungen auf Konflikt und Frieden sowie die Unterst\u00fctzung bei der Entwicklung von Ideen, wie die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels angegangen/reduziert werden k\u00f6nnen, in alle Projektaktivit\u00e4ten einbezogen.",

        "description": "1. Early married/adolescent mothers/ adolescent girls who have dropped out: Low to no expectation that these girls will enroll or re-enroll in school. Girls themselves are reluctant to enroll/re-enroll they are embarrassed to enter school in a class with younger children. At mid line, 81% of caregivers stated age as an important deciding factor as to whether a child should attend school. Intensive accelerated learning classes will be key to enabling these girls to increase their learning level and to engage/re-engage with school amongst girls their own age. Nuanced messaging through BCC campaigns will raise the community support for girls of all ages to prioritize schooling. 2. Disabled girls: Low to no expectation that these girls will enrol in school. For those who are enrolled they are not expected to achieve at the same level as their peers. The teacher training module will be developed focusing on basic approaches to inclusive education, enabling teachers to better engage with disabled children in the classroom. Additionally, disabled girls will be targeted for bursary support. 3. IDPs, refugees, returnees Girls may have fled a conflict situation; violence and upheaval may have a negative impact on psychosocial wellbeing. Due to limited mobility, girls miss school and fall behind. These factors can lead to a general expectation, of the girl and her parents, that girls will not progress and succeed in school. Girls in these groups who are extremely poor will be identified for bursary support ensuring economic barriers do not prevent attendance. Additionally, psycho social support from trained teacher mentors will aid an increase in girls\u2019 well being. 4. Orphans, minorities and other girls from poor households Girls are often expected to leave school early, if they enrol at all, to look after siblings and contribute to family income, with school-going costs understandably a lower priority. Bursary support will help enable girls from poor households to attend school, despite the economic challenges they face. 5.Children of lower learning ability/demonstrating low performance in the classroom The percentage of caregivers stating that a child\u2019s ability should be an important factor determining whether a child should attend school reduced from 88% to 43%. Specifically designed messages promoted through BCC activities will increase community support for children of all abilities to attend school. Remedial classes will help those children keep up with the learning levels of their peers.",

The proposed project seeks to challenge harmful social norms including Female Genital Mutilation and Child Early and Forced Marriage and to increase womens social and economic empowerment through interventions at the individual, household, community and societal levels. Successful implementation of these interventions will result in reduction in harmful practices, increased value of women and girls and will contribute towards greater voice, choice and control for Somali women and girls over their bodies and futures (Project Impact). This will be achieved transforming social norms to support gender equality in Somalia (Outcome) through three key outcome areas: 1) Enhanced legal and policy environment for greater equality of women and girls; 2) Improved knowledge and attitudes of men, women, girls and boys on gender discriminatory social norms; and 3) Increased social and economic empowerment of women and girls. IRC will be working in Galkayo (South), Hobyo, Hawal-wadag, Karaan.",

The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.

        "description": "This Joint FGS-UN Programme aims to capitalise on recent security, governance and reconciliation achievements by expanding employment opportunities for young men and women, mainly in newly recovered areas. The programme recognizes the centrality of youth in fostering stability in the country and outlines specific interventions that can be taken within the next 24 months to begin to generate decent work opportunities for young people that will serve as positive alternatives to participation in violence and conflict. This will also contribute to the revitalization of the local economy. The programme will tackle youth at risk, unemployed and underemployed youth. The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months. The programme will initially be tailored for the first 24 months as per the Compact deadline (see also Table 1): \u2022 1: Improved long-term potential for growth, productivity and employment of at least three value chains in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector. \u2022 2: Equip 10,000 youth with basic literacy, numeracy and life-skills and sector-specific vocational and business training to enhance their employability to access sustainable job opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential. \u2022 3: Create 30,000 short-term jobs created through cash-for-work projects to rehabilitate productive infrastructure in target locations, mainly in newly recovered areas.",

It builds on ongoing work to promote employment, decent work and income opportunities in Somalia. The project strategy draws on the findings of the review of the DWCP of Somalia (2014-2016), which among other issues, has pointed to the need for tailored capacity development interventions to enable workers and employers organizations to deliver services to their members and effectively engage in social dialogue. The project interventions will focus on: (i) addressing the youth employment challenges; (ii) creating a strong connection between humanitarian and development support; (iii) building on employment-intensive investment strategies; and (iv) integrating direct employment creation and skills and enterprise development for increased employability. The project is expected to provide opportunities for the ILO to leverage resources, expertise and synergies at the country level, notably through cooperation and collaboration within the UN system as well as with development partners. This project contributes to the country\u2019s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG targets 1.5 (Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters) and 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services).",

        "description": "The 3rd phase of the Joint Programme on Local Governance (JPLG) will focus on creating an enabling environment for improved service delivery and greater stability, through improved legal, policy and system frameworks \u2013 building the knowledge of those working in and with local governments. Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

Luglio 2019 ha segnato il livello pi\u00f9 basso di raccolti agricoli a partire dal 1995, il 70 sotto la media, con conseguenze umanitarie disastrose sulla popolazione. Le abbondanti piogge dell'ultimo mese hanno tuttavia provocato inondazioni nelle aree agricole, distruggendo sia gli insediamenti umani sia la produzione agricola Inoltre la mancanza di strutture igienico sanitarie di base ha causato il diffondersi del colera, della malaria e di altre malattie trasmissibili. Si stima che circa 5.4 milioni di Somali si trovino in condizione di insicurezza alimentare e necessitino di interventi urgenti per la sopravvivenza. L'intervento prevede attivit\u00e0 di emergenza anche volte al rafforzamento della resilienza con approccio DRR (Disasters Risk Reduction), di chi si trova in situazioni vulnerabili, aumentandone la capacit\u00e0 di fronteggiare futuri shock climatici, economici e sociali.",

        "description": "Since the collapse of the Somali central government in 1991, Somalia has suffered a highly complex protracted conflict characterized by changing political dynamics and power shifts. Although there have been improvements to the peace and security situation in Somalia since the formation of the Federal Government of Somalia in 2012, the overall situation remains fragile with Al-Shabab a major obstacle to peace and security. Forced displacement remains an ongoing a reality for people living in Somalia due to armed conflict, environmental hardships due to climate change, combined with inadequate resource distribution that is often exacerbated by clan based, ideological differences and land and natural resources competition. The COVID-19 pandemic has added yet another hazard that people in Somalia face. While it has now been over a year since the first case was detected in Somalia and efforts have been made to mitigate the risk, the situation is always evolving. With the main objective to ensure dignified, safe and secure living conditions and basic services for vulnerable populations affected by conflict and disasters in Somalia, IOM proposes an integrated camp coordination and camp management, Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and shelter and non-food item emergency support.",

        "description": "March 2019 - Decades of political instability have left Somalia facing a complex and protracted humanitarian crises with an estimated 4.2 million Somalis (35 percent of the population) expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2019. Some 2.6 million people have been forced from their homes, with little or no access to the basic services. Acute malnutrition rates remain near or above emergency thresholds, particularly among displaced populations. Violence due to terrorist threats and multiple conflicts has made access a challenge in many regions, hampering the ability of humanitarian workers to reach those in need.  With the support of GAC and other donors to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is providing funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond to newly emerging crises and shifting/deteriorating humanitarian situations. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities, such as shelter, healthcare and protection, by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening the coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

        "description": "Some 1.5 billion people, half of the world\u2019s poor, live in fragile settings where the government is unable or unwilling to fulfill its core responsibilities to protect and care for its citizens. In such fragile settings, often characterized by variable levels of violent conflict, perspectives for stability and sustainable inclusive development - key priorities of the Dutch Government - continue to be extremely bleak. Whereas each fragile setting is unique, a broad international consensus exists on the multiple and complex causes that need to be addressed for a transition out of fragility. Among these, establishing inclusive governance processes is considered essential. A key obstacle for achieving stability and sustainable development in fragile settings is the structural exclusion of segments of society from local, district level and national governance processes. Our theory of change (TOC) addresses this with a focus on inclusive governance processes, referring to the extent to which governance processes provide space to overcome the systematic exclusion of disadvantaged groups seeking to participate in decision making. Therefore this strategic partnership\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to inclusive and effective governance processes in fragile settings. Specific target and impact groups may vary country by country and will be determined on the basis of thorough analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of women in governance processes is key to stability and development in all countries and therefore crosscuts all program interventions.",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

The pentavalent vaccine, administered in a three-dose schedule, offers protection against five diseases: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), heptatitis B and Haemophilius influenzae type b. Until 2013, GAVI has helped to introduce the pentavalent in 70 of the 73 GAVI-eligible countries, with the aim of reaching all 73 by the end of 2014. GAVI support for pentavalent vaccine is in line with WHO recommendations, for routine infant immunisation and primarily targeting children under one year of age.",

Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017.

In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

While initiatives by the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) cluster such as integrating the Washington Group Questions (WGQs) into the site verification exercise have attempted to highlight important site-level data, the reliance on key informant interview methodologies present challenges in obtaining accurate information. In addition to an absence in comprehensive disability data, humanitarian service providers continue to lack a clear understanding of the barriers and challenges that persons with disabilities face in Somalia IDP sites.  Therefore, there is a need for an extensive disability inclusion assessment in IDP sites that both look to collect important demographic data on persons with disabilities, in addition to illustrating methods for tailored delivery of humanitarian services to persons with disabilities in IDP sites.  The assessment will apply an intersectional gender lens and take into account the needs and the specific challenges faced by different sex and age groups. This type of study has not been able to be conducted in Somalia IDP sites due to the vast number of active IDP sites (+2400) and the scattered nature of their locations within district hubs and centers. The assessment will propose and support the integration of identified corrective actions to address barriers and challenges in the inclusion of persons with disabilities in humanitarian response.",

        "description": "In 2020, Somalia had been hit by Multiple threats from Covid-19, locusts, conflict, insecurity, forced evictions, droughts, and flooding. The number of people in need has consistently increased over the last three years, from 4.2 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020 and 5.9 million in 2021 according to the CCCM cluster Acaps review. This is further reflected in the number of displaced people in 2020/2021. 47% of the population of 12.3 million needs some form of humanitarian assistance, including 2.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), with an additional half a million displaced on average per year as a result of climatic conditions and conflict. Most displacement-affected persons face multiple or recurrent displacements, with a majority of IDPs having been displaced at least five times previously and very few return to areas of origin. Post-Gu IPC analysis conducted in September 2020 by FEWSNET and partners, indicates that an estimated 1.7 million people are anticipated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with 0.4 million persons experiencing an emergency (IPC Phase 4). An additional 3.0 million persons are expected to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2), with the current conditions projected to remain unchanged by end of 2020. Projections running into 2021, through May, predict continued Stressed (IPC 2) and Crisis (IPC 3) outcomes to persevere, largely due to continued struggles of affected households to overcome shocks. Households in IDP areas in the Banadir region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by the high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large-scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. Camp coordination and camp management is a relatively a concept that\u2019s limited within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized to this concept. \n\nSCC will implement these activities in 20 IDP sites in Kahda district of Banadir region with over 30,000HHs as per the latest detailed site assessment (DSA), targeting a largely underserved area. Approximately 36000 IDPs (6000 households) will benefit from this proposed intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding, or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys, and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age, and diversity dis-segregated data. SCC will implement this intervention in the Kahda district of Banadir region targeting 6000 HHs. Kaxda District is one of the IDP major hubs in Mogadishu that hosts the largest number of IDPs. Throughout the project, the needs of women, girls, men, and boys of all ages will be addressed throughout the planning, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation of the activities. Through regular site monitoring, needs and gaps will be reported and shared with partners and all stakeholders. Particular attention regarding needs will be paid to women and girls who also have to contend with GBV and protection concerns within camp settings. Through this project, SCC will also address the current and newly identified needs by setting up camp coordination structures at the national and, where necessary, regional or district levels, facilitating and supporting the establishment of effective coordination and management in IDP sites while respecting national context and authorities.",

        "description": "This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 36,000 IDP persons from 40 settlements in Kahda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including enhancing the capacity of camp governance structures and site-level committees to promote information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include organizing site-level coordination meetings among service providers and local authorities to highlight priority needs and challenges, mitigate protection risks and ensure efficient use of existing referral pathways. 10 site-level mobilizers, each serving as a focal point for 4 sites, will be hired from target IDPs to circulate key messages, report on gaps, conduct service mapping, needs and new arrivals, conduct site monitoring and take shelter-level CFM complaints in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address vulnerabilities and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nSite maintenance committees and IDPs in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out. In the selection of cash-for-work beneficiaries, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complaint mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population. Target sites will be prioritized based on vulnerability such as congestion levels, proportion of minority groups, potential exposure to protection risks and overall living conditions. AVORD will utilize cluster tools such as the IDP site risk map or DSA data in the process of site selection. A site-level Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be developed and the project team will ensure that the system is accessible for all populations and that the mechanism is clearly understood and supported by the community.\n\nThe present proposal will complement an interagency program currently being implemented by AVORD and other partners in Banadir to provide WASH and awareness raising services to reduce Covid 19 transmission. Synergies will be developed with these activities to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the resources.",

        "description": "The proposed 12-month intervention will aim to close the gap between crisis-affected children and enrolment as well as retention in schools. This is through improving access to quality education, increase access to critical WASH inputs and enhance child protection mechanisms in 15 schools that are among the priority schools for the education cluster that are at a high risk to close or have closed due to drought in Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. These schools are: Almaamum and Balihoowd primary in Balanbale Cumar Khadaab and Lajide primary in Xeraale Tawakal, Dugsiga H/dhexe and Howlwadhaag primary schools in Abudwak Xananleey, Alma\u2019mun, and Higlaale primary in Dhusamareeb Mucalim Ibrahim and Kobciye IDP primary in Guriceel and Kulmiye IDP, Docoley and Dayax primary in Cadaado. The identified needs in the 15 schools include water shortage, poor state of classroom and WASH facilities, shortage of teaching and learning materials, limited access to dry food rations, low attendance rate of teachers due to lack of incentives, low awareness on child protection reporting mechanisms by students and teachers, poor hygiene in the schools due limited access to clean water for drinking and handwashing. These needs have affected attendance and retention of learners in the 15 targeted schools. The main gaps in delivery of quality education services in the 15 schools include limited capacity of the Ministry of Education to provide the required education services due to budgetary constraints lack of intervention by other education partners due to the remoteness of the school that contributes to inaccessibility and security challenges to operate in these areas recurrent drought and intermittent conflict leading to loss of livelihoods for the communities in the targeted locations. The project will target to directly reach 2,315 learners out of which 1,266 boys and 1,049 are girls, 30 teachers translating to 2 teachers plus 1 head teacher per school, 30 community hygiene promoters and indirectly reach 45 CEC members. Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, water trucking to the schools to ensure a regular supply of water to the schools during drought, construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with community hygiene promoters (CHPs). To ensure inclusion of students with disabilities, child, gender and disability friendly latrines will be constructed with accessibility ramps and door sizes made within the required inclusion standards to enable access by students with disabilities to these facilities. CISP will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by drought and displacement. To ensure centrality of protection in the schools, CISP will assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, appoint and train protection focal points in the schools to strengthen feedback and reporting mechanisms to address protection concerns in the schools., Through engagement with ministry officials such as Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education  MoECHE Gender Focal Points,  the Ministry of Women and Human rights Development MoWHRD Regional Child Protection Coordinator and CECs, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

Further, the intervention proposes to support learner retention, improve learning environment and ensure safety of learners. The intervention has been designed to meet the needs of vulnerable girls, women, boys and men, IDPs and host communities in the three target districts (Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow). In ensuring centrality of protection, the program has been designed to enhance awareness/dissemination of child protection amp safeguarding principles with targeted girls and boys through establishment of leadership networks/clubs/platforms in targeted public schools in Gedo region. The intervention has based a big bulk of its outputs towards supporting IDP children (70%) and children from vulnerable host communities to enroll in permanent functional schools within Gedo, to ensure sustainability. The intervention is designed to build on gains made by the ongoing Education Cannot Wait (ECW) project as well as DFID funded Leave No Girl Behind (LNGB) which targets the same schools and locations, and to leverage and complement on other sectoral interventions in the same schools (WASH, Protection, Health), and will adopt an integrated approach that will focus on drought, protection, COVID-19 prevention and control, and life-saving interventions. In order to ensure access to safe and protective learning environment for vulnerable learners, the intervention shall among other key interventions: construct/rehabilitate TLS, provide safe drinking water hygiene promotion in schools (including COVID-19 prevention and control messaging), distribute sanitary kits to girls, establish school WASH facilities based on need, distribute TLM, pay emergency teacher incentives, provision of school feeding program as well as implementation of child protection activities in line with the education and child protection integrated response framework. The intervention will be implemented in a total of eighteen (18) schools in Gedo Region. The final list of schools will be agreed upon together with the Gedo Education Cluster Focal Point (HIRDA) to ensure that only the most needy drought-affected schools are supported.

PMWDO is currently implementing a UNICEF-funded \u201cEducating girls with disabilities\u201d in the Puntland State of Somalia but not in the target location for this project. This proposed project will not only complement but also retain children in the affected target locations to have access to continued learning otherwise children would have displaced to where there is an ongoing intervention which could create a burden on the ongoing response. The proposed response is therefore meant to link up to reach to school being supported under this program to enable the children to continue access education support. The project will also extend to cover other schools where high EIE needs have been established but are not covered by PMWDO or any other organization. PMWDO will rehabilitate classrooms and other affected infrastructure like Latrines. The project also envisages addressing the immediate needs of the students through the distribution of scholastic materials/TLM including learning kits, curriculum books, and recreational materials. The project will guarantee gender mainstreaming, and equity as 1200 girls will be supported with dignity kits and sanitary pads. Using the reflective circles' approach PMWDO will train 32 teachers (18 males and 14 female) teachers and the students on Education in Emergency contents and life skills development.",

        "description": "The NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO\n\nIn response to, and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed of 4 INGOs: Halo Trust, IRC, INTERSOS, FCA and 1 LNGO SYDAVO), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training and preparation to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support. Information is shared on adhoc basis daily or several time a day as alerts if the security incident requires the immediate action of NGOs and scheduled products are sent every week, every fortnight and every quarter\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor assistants (all INSO staff have their own network to source information as they are very close to the community and in contact with a wide range of local actors), NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 57,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO Training Team runs training programs which targets both individual safety and management of the organization's security. Finally, INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs.\nThe project budget leans heavily in HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "Critical humanitarian needs persist in Somalia across the different livelihood groups whose vulnerabilities continue to worsen due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic and escalating conflict. The poor Deyr rains (October to December 2020) led to the inadequate pasture for livestock, water shortage and below average crop production. The deteriorating food security outlook combined with the worsening malnutrition appeals for a rapid, well-targeted and coordinated scale up of responses to save lives and recovery of livelihoods assets. The project aims to improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihood assets related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages through conditional cash transfers to enhance livelihood opportunities and rehabilitation of water infrastructures and provision of fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in agro-pastoral and pastoral villages in Belet-Hawa district, Gedo region. \nThe project will target 815 vulnerable drought affected agro-pastoral and pastoral households among women, men, boys, girls, including female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The detrimental effects of the current shocks have severely and directly affected rural communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk leading to household food insecurity, increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and livestock use. Additionally, the affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debts. \nCOOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation process, target communities, especially women, girls and the disabled will be included in community representative committees and decision making processes In selection of beneficiaries, registrations, verifications and monitoring exercises so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, conditional cash transfer will be provided to 815 affected household including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services.\nTo restore livelihood assets of households, 815 beneficiaries will engage in cash for work activities construction and/or rehabilitation of water catchments and water harvesting structures (soil bunds), 150 households among the CFW beneficiaries will also be provided with fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in the areas where soil bunds structures have been constructed to regenerate pasture to ensure availability of fodder for livestock. This activity aims at restoring livestock assets of the communities and envisages reducing workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, gender based violence and exploitation malpractices associated with in search of livestock feeds and water for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed activity. In summary the following activities will be carried out:\n1. Provide conditional cash transfer to 815 households in Belet-Hawa district to increase household purchasing power and rehabilitate livelihood assets and water sources.\n2. Support to fodder production through provision of Sudan grass seeds) for 150 affected households in Belet-Hawa district.",

The project will also train selected beneficiaries in improved fodder production and management. The project directly targets mostly under-served individuals and living in hard to reach areas in 5 villages including Badhi Galis Satellite, Bixin, Masle in Ceel Afweyn district and Rag Caddeye, Marwade in Ceerigaabo district all in Sanag region. The target beneficiaries will mainly include women, men, persons with disability, children and the elderly and other vulnerable groups broadly categorized as host communities and IDPs. The project duration is 7 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions. \n\nSpecifically, 239 households (HH) including 235 workers and 4 foremen will receive conditional Cash Transfers. Each of the 235 household/ beneficiary will receive $126 for 3 months/ rounds, while the 4 foremen will be recruited for 54 days and paid a daily rate of $10. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. A PDM will be conducted after the first round of cash transfer to determine level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries. A local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFurthermore, at least 40 households from Bali Gelis and Bixin will be trained in improved fodder production and management and provided with fodder seedlings. In the same villages, 2 fodder shades will be constructed to improve fodder storage. \n\nAlso, 2 berkads will be constructed in 2 villages including Rag Caddeye and Marwade in Ceerigaabo district and 2 dams will be rehabilitated in Rag Caddeye and Masle villages through conditional cash transfer in order to improve community access to water for household and livestock use through rehabilitated water infrastructure. Water catchments (rangelands) will be rehabilitated and reseeded to increase availability of fodder for the animals. \n\nCandlelight has rolled out a mobile phone/ technology beneficiary feedback and complaints mechanism (\u201cfeedback loops\u201d) with a tool free and easy to remember telephone number.

The intervention aims to ensure that lives are saved and human suffering is reduced through provision of food security production inputs to targeted beneficiaries in order to ensure immediate access to inputs and subsequently to food for the most vulnerable populations. Due to the Current biting  droughts , this project  will target a total of 650 HHs approximately 3,900(585 men, 975women, 1,170 boys and 1,170 girls in drought affected people in Garowe. Female-headed HHs and young adolescents girls will constitute approximately 60% of beneficiary households. This weighting towards female-headed households is because they are considered more vulnerable due to their restricted options for paid labor. Once a household has been identified as a beneficiary, the project will primarily target women and who have lost livelihoods as result of water shortages within the households to receive  cash for work vouchers by rehabilitating harvesting structures and Berked  as result of the water shortage, Women have been targeted as beneficiaries since they typically make household food purchases and determine meal distribution within the household. Furthermore, The proposed project will target those households in the most critical situations. Not all households are at the same level of destitution or crisis. There are, for example, some households that do not have productive assets but receive remittances from relatives abroad. Beneficiary identification and selection will be managed by KAALO and facilitated by the existing  villages and elder Committees (CRCs), which are comprised of IDPs leaders, community elders and key stakeholders\nCriteria for targeting is as follows: priority will be given to recently displaced (within the past year) female headed HHs, HHs with vulnerable members including pregnant women, children lt5, elderly, sick and/or disabled persons. Individual households (both IDP and local community) will be targeted and selected based on established criteria for vulnerability as mentioned above. \n\n1.\tRehabilitation of two water catchment to immediately access to cash for work to 300 HHs for 2 months , These will be constructed during selected months to enable over 1800 beneficiaries (300HHs) including men, women, boys and girls (gt18 years of age) get Cash for work to cover food. KAALO will distribute 100 sets of hand tools per village for two locations.

        "description": "The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2021 and the 1st 2021 SHF Standard Allocation for Food Security and Livelihoods that will respond to acute water shortages in Galkayo South (Mudug region), which are experiencing pre-drought conditions.\n\nThe Project will improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihoods related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages occasioned by pre-drought conditions, conflicts and impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nThe Project targets an estimated 706HH (4,236 people) assessed to be in acute food insecurity, \u2018Crisis\u2019 and \u2018Emergency\u2019 phases of IPC (3 and 4) by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and water support. The project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 662 unskilled labourers and 44 semi-skilled labourers rehabilitating 9 Water Pans in 9 settlements in Galkayo South. Each of the 662 unskilled labourers shall get $6 per day while each of the 44 semi-skilled labourers will work at the rate of $8 per day:- Daily work output per person per day as per the Somalia CWG standards is 1.585M3 ( 5hours* 0.317M3). The total number of working days is 25 for each water pan, However, they will be rehabilitated in different months to allow for prudent supervision, monitoring and evaluation and reporting by the project team. The nine water pans to be rehabilitated are 1. Gaarcad, 2. Dhagfaruuryaale, 3. Cinjirre, 4. Laamawayne, 5. Rasan, 6. Balicadde, 7. Xaarxaar, 8. Qooraseyn, 9.Biyogaduud.\n\nThe project will specifically prioritise destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the four Districts). The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains and Desert locust infestation leading to inadequate pasture, water resources and below-average crop production in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below-average rainfall for the coming Gu 2021 season as indicated by FEWSNET/FSNAU in its February to September 2021 update. \n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries, ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project activities to ensure it provides women the safety and protection required. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. \n\nCPD plans to use the first 2 months of the project to undertake household vulnerability assessment in the identified locations within South Mudug, undertake community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration for the Conditional Cash Transfers beneficiaries captured in KoboConnect. The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). The rehabilitation works involving excavation of water pans to required provided dimensions will be done across 3 months for the 9 sites in Galkayo South of Mudug region. Payments to the unskilled and semi-skilled labourers will be made through Mobile Money Transfer once the scheduled work is completed. The project will carry out post-distribution monitoring in the final month of the project.",

Specifically, this nutrition program will promote access to quality care, adequate nutrition, and encourage healthier behaviors to optimize the communities\u2019 resilience to future nutrition emergencies. \nMercy-USA for Aid and Development, in partnership with the MoH, will continue to address the nutrition challenges by implementing the integrated package in 2 fixed facilities in Karan district and 2 fixed facilities and 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team) in Yaqshid district in Banadir region.\nFacility and community-based Basic Nutrition Services Package (BNSP) will cover both curative and preventative interventions targeting children under 5 years old (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women.\nMercy-USA will ensure that the nutrition sites will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff, and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. \nMercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and offer refresher trainings to staff.\nThis program will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support, and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. \nScreening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programs. \nAccording to IMAM guidelines, children in the nutrition program will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition program will receive deworming drugs and relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A.\nSerious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia.

Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somalia Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to the target communities including internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach in Lasanod district areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project. \nThe project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. \n\nIn order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.\nLikewise, the project will give particular emphasis on the current COVID-19 pandemic prevention measure to contain the spread of the virus. Gender and protection activities will be effectively mainstreamed into the project. Every effort will be made to ensure equity and to reach the most vulnerable population in Lasanod District.",

        "description": "FSNAU 2020 post Deyr assessment indicates both GAM and SAM are serious with aggravating factors.  Food security is expected to worsen. The poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains led to the inadequate pasture, water resources and below average crop production. Weather predictions point towards a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall from April to June due to the La Nina effect. \nThe key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional and stable health system. Tied to that is scarce availability of health professionals and poor community literacy levels (UNICEF 2019 OCHA 2020). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease. \nServices in Dhobley barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure . Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2020SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2021).  Water shortage has already been reported in Dhobley with population displaced due to water shortage. This is expected to get worse if the predicted La Nina manifests next month (OCHA, 2021)\nWomen and children urgently need integrated services targeting prevention and treatment of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition.  WRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project by WFP that focuses on treatment of moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM) and maternal, child health and nutriton (MCHN) at health facilities . These services have not integrated treatment of  severe acute malnutrition (SAM) therefore children with SAM  are left untreated and so at risk of death. WFP funded project also lacks key primary prevention interventions like Micro nutrient supplementation for children 6-59 months and PLW, de worming and IYCF support. Integrating these services will  contribute to significant reduction in prevalence of malnutrition and related mortality.\nThe project will apply the grant strategy and help achieve cluster objective 2 of providing life saving interventions especially for those affected by drought like conditions. It focuses on scaling up and fully integrating nutrition interventions that will ensure full treatment of acute malnutrition.The proposed project will link to SHF's 2021 allocation strategy, the fund's strategic objectives and cluster specific objectives. We hope this will bring down the effects of the prevailing triple threat of COVID 19, floods and Desert Locusts , in addition to the most recent predicted La Nina, on acute malnutrition state. \nWRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project funded by WFP that covers treatment of Moderate acute malnutrition, MCHN and a relief project. The proposed project will bring in treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition thus ensuring full treatment of acute malnutrition at one stop. Beneficiaries will not be referred to other facilities and/or partners, which sometimes complicates treatment by increasing defaulters. This project will also support primary prevention interventions not covered by WFP project, which are very vital. These will include Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) support and micro nutrient supplication for both children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). This proposed project seeks to scale up and integrate treatment of acute malnutrition through a fixed site in Dhobley,being in a health facility. which will of will offer TSFP for treatment of MAM,OTP for treatment of  uncomplicated SAM and Stabilization center for treatment of complicated SAM, all these with prevention interventions. There will also be 1 mobile team to cover IDP  and hard to reach rural areas with treatment of MAM and uncomplicated SAM integrating  prevention interventions.",

        "description": "According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2020/ technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated. In Ceelwaq nutrition situation of district continues to deteriorate further with limited humanitarian assistance. Post day 2020 released by FSNAU in Februar 2021 indicated that a chronic high level of acute malnutrition in Elwak district. The target areas have many challenges contributing to acute malnutrition particularly rural areas where access is constrained. The Desert Locust has caused significant damage to 2020 pastures and grassing land for livestock\u2019s which the backbone liveliho of communities in Ceelwaq. The latest forecasts indicate that Desert Locust continues to pose a very high risk to rural livelihoods across Somalia in 2021, potentially exacerbating the impact of the anticipated below-average 2021 Gu rains. The Nutrition Cluster estimates caseloads of about 300 SAM and 2120 MAM annually in the Ceelwaq district with an estimated population of about 30,689 population PESS. HDC is an active nutrition/health partner and currently implementing EAC simplified protocol in partnership with UNICEF as well HIV-Global fund emergency health in Ceelwaq general hospital, Dhamasa and Hosqurun MCHs in Ceelwaq district. In Decembe 2020, UNICEF emergency projects, Covid 19, emergency primary health and implementation of the expanded admission criteria of acute malnutrition to the outpatient therapeutic program EAC that supported health and nutrition intervention in Ceelwaq district implemented by HDC came to a end. This left a gap in health and nutrition in three-way district. The Proposed project will therefore bridge the major essential nutrition service gap that currently exists in Ceelwaq following the ended UNICEF and HDC PD out of the integrated health and nutrition Project. The project will address the identified gaps in nutrition, enhancing access to nutrition services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations. These specific needs have been outlined in the HRP and FSNAU and UNOCHA mulita cluster need rapid assessment gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. HDC will work with MOH-Federal, JSS-MOH to address the nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls, and persons living with physical disabilities in the targeted district. 2 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated and hard to reach populations in Ceelwaq district. Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with MAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be referred to HDC Managed district hospital supported by UNICEF before but still functional supporting by HDC. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the SCs that HDC propose to support in Ceelwaq district hospital and Damase referral health center in Ceelwaq district. However, we are facing a shortage of funding to sustain the existing nutrition services. Through this project, HDC is planning to maintain and support the existing nutrition services (2 fixed OTP, 1 stabilization center in the Ceelwaq general hospital with integration of health projects and one mobile teams into reaching 6 villages comprising IDPs and Hard to reach rural population mostly affected by crises in Elwak district. This nutrition intervention will build on HDC's ongoing emergency nutrition and health interventions in high risks areas in Ceelwaq district and will support the continuation of essential life-saving treatment in the context of COVID and other ongoing outbreaks in line with IMAM guideline.",

It is also designed to increase access to information and specialised services, which displaced communities required to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of their HLP and other rights. This will also entail identifying pressing capacity gaps and supporting state institutions and administrative structures to systematically address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion in target communities.\n\nThe proposed action builds on NRC\u2019s hands-on expertise in HLP programming in Somalia, and targeting 4030 households in Kismayo, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced affected communities HLP rights and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of long-lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities to reduce the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthen tenure security among displaced communities at the highest risk of eviction, and consolidate the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include the following:\n-\tprovision of reliable and up-to-date information and specialised services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights \n-\texpanding access to tenure security through documentation and technical support monitoring and mapping of evictions trends \n-\tsupporting the Kismayo Evictions Taskforce to lead in evictions response and programming and helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash \n-\tstrengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities\n-\tprovision of legal counselling, assistance and representation \n-\tcapacity-building trainings for rights holders, decision-makers and duty bearers on HLP and\n-\tadvocacy and undertaking comprehensive assessments and surveys, leading to the development of action plans and informing planned relocations.\n\nThe centrality of Housing, Land and Property (HLP) assistance is a key component to achieving lasting durable solutions for Displacement Affected Communities (DACs). Sustainable (re)integration remains unattainable without securing access to land, improving security of tenure and reducing the threat of evictions. Against this backdrop, there are multiple challenges linked to accessing HLP rights by DACs that exist. The HLP challenges are created by repeated, protracted displacement in urban areas exacerbated by the high demand (in the context of rapid urbanisation, investment and development) and skyrocketing land prices. This has been compounded by competing claims on land coupled with limited legal and policy frameworks around HLP rights, inadequate technical and functional capacities of state institutions, and weak mechanisms for resolving HLP disputes. Besides, DACs lack knowledge of their HLP rights and how to exercise them, and women\u2019s access to HLP rights is adversely affected due to discriminatory customs.",

        "description": "Since the beginning of 2020, additional shocks, extensive floods, desert locust infestations, the COVID-19 pandemic and drought have had compounding effects, further deteriorating already compromised systems and gains that had already been made in the economy. The secondary impacts have impacted directly the well-being of children with the rise of negative coping mechanisms being witnessed and reported such as rise in child marriage, psychological distress, sexual violence and other harmful practices. According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview (2021) children and adolescents in Somalia are targets of killing, maiming and abduction, recruitment into armed groups, detention, sexual and physical violence. Boys are at an elevated risk of recruitment to armed groups. The actual extent of grave violations of children\u2019s rights is higher than what is reported and verified. Separated and unaccompanied children are at heightened risk of various forms of violence, exploitation and abuse. While some have been placed into alternative care arrangements, a large number live alone or in the street. COVID-19 and the drought situation has stretched the foster families providing alternative care to the children. The Child Protection AoR assessment in 2020 carried out among partners also reported that children were expressing aggressive behaviors which point out to psychological distress stemming from the dire living conditions at home. IA recent study conducted by WVI in Luuq and other neighboring districts revealed that the market places, water points were some of the places identified by both IDPs and host communities as unsafe for children. The major child protection concerns identified during this study included child labour, child marriage, school dropout and sexual violence. These results are   corroborated by the education cluster reports that indicated that children are out of school in Gedo region as a result of drought with about 6000 primary school children affected. This project has been designed to respond to these needs through risk mitigation and prevention of violations of children rights and addressing child protection needs through case management. Leveraging on already existing health, WASH and Food and Cash Assistance projects in Luuq, this project\u2019s interventions have been designed to synergize efforts to deliver well-coordinated interventions to address the child protection needs. This presence of WVI staff in Luuq and the existing connection with community structures already provides registered vulnerable people groups for this project to build on. Prevention of violations and risk mitigation through a community led process has been factored including capacity building plans for self-protection among the children and their care givers. Awareness raising on the child protection and equipping of care givers with positive parenting skills is provided for to ensure children associated with armed forces and armed groups are safely re-integrated within their households and community.  To increase access to specialized child protection services either directly or through referral, update and dissemination of the referral pathway is one of the key intervention planned for to raise awareness among service providers and the community for quick and timely response. Provision for MHPSS at individual and group level has been created to meet the needs of children across different ages. Home visits will be facilitated by the care givers to meet the needs of children with disability to ensure they are not left out. Child Friendly Spaces as a measure for MHPSS has also been included in the project. COVID-19 control measures of hand washing and provision of masks for the children will be done. Screening before admission will also be done with the CFS being equipped with thermometers. Through these activities, 1300boys, 1650girls, 850men, 1100 women and 354 of persons with disability 50M,60W,122B and122G will be reached.",

        "description": "The situation of people affected by displacement and disasters remains precarious with respect to physical safety and dignity. As a result of destitution, women, men, girls and boys, are exposed to particular and various forms of violence, exploitation and discrimination. Frequent protection risks reported on the ground include (i) GBV, (ii) forced evictions, (iii) exposure to explosive hazards and (iv) child rights violations, such as child recruitment by armed groups and early marriage. Displacement increases the risk of family separation, and currently, there is an estimated caseload of 8,000 unaccompanied or separated children in Somalia. Furthermore, due to the loss of men\u2019s livelihoods, displaced women are increasingly taking on the role of breadwinners, which exposes them to the increased risk of domestic violence.\nIn a country where violence has been ongoing since 1991, persons with disabilities face extreme hurdles in being recognized, accessing resources and feeling valued in their community. This is particularly true for children and women with disabilities. Persons with disabilities in Somalia are side-lined in every aspect of humanitarian response and are being denied their economic, social and cultural rights. Reports show that persons with disabilities in Somalia are often denied access to water, food, sanitation and accommodation through lack of explicit inclusion\nAccordingly, Somalia marginalized minority communities are facing disaster human and humanitarian situation, extreme poverty and hunger which can lead is causing slow collective death, as members of these communities, especially women youth and children are suffer most from various forms human rights abuse, social and economic deprivation, including hunger and malnutrition, inadequate healthcare, limited access to education, and low self-esteem etc. Due to the above reasons, the minorities are the neediest group of people facing worst starvation, highest poverty rates, massive displacement, huge unemployment figures, highest illiteracy levels and horrific health and sanitation status. Unlike other clans from dominant groups, minorities lack international support due the prolonged Somali conflict which creates an environment where minority groups are vulnerable and abnormally displaced from their homes. Therefore, they suffer grievous human rights violations, which included extra judicial killings, appropriation of lands and properties, and forced displacement from their lands to IDP or refugee camps situated along the Somalia Ethiopia border. \nPopulation estimates indicate that of the 9.3 million people in Somalia, over 400,000 (4.3% of the population) are aged 60 or over.4 Nearly half the population 3.7 million people are now in crisis. Amongst them are approximately 160,000 people aged 60 and over (UNHCR) Practices and approaches that neither recognize their potential nor incorporate their needs place older men and women in a vulnerable situation. Older people\u2019s vulnerabilities stem from lack of opportunities, services and exclusion. There is also growing feminization of the older population as women outlive men leaving many widowed older women. However, gender bias and discrimination can place older women in a very vulnerable situation with few projects targeting older women. Whilst many of the challenges faced by older persons are also faced by other community members, for instance water storage, collection of firewood and limited opportunities for livelihoods, the implications of these challenges can be much greater for older men and women, due to age-related vulnerabilities.",

Interventions will be implemented jointly by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and Horn of Africa Peace Network (HAPEN), NoFYL and SEDHURO. DRC will implement both general protection and WASH components. While HAPEN will implement Shelter/NFI components, NoFYL will implement CCCM and HLP components while SEDHURO will carry out the Child Protection component. DRC and HAPEN had originally entered into a teaming agreement for the implementation of project but with the approval of NoFYL and SEDHURO as implementation partners, active collaboration and coordination with the two organizations will be explored. The integrated approach by the 4 organizations, will create synergies, utilize agency expertise and community networks to access and provide adequate and quality services to the most vulnerable members of the community. \n\n\nThe proposed DRC intervention is designed to contribute to the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the efforts to address the needs of most vulnerable displacement affected communities with a focus on Belet Xaawo district, Gedo region which is a key location targeted by SHF allocation strategy in 2021. The intervention will promote Protection as a central part of programming and will incorporate continuous awareness creation, analysis of protection risks, training amp follow up for effective implementation in line with the Centrality of Protection Strategy 2020-2021 adopted by the HCT in June 2020. Specifically, the project will strengthen the protection of most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men affected by climatic shocks, conflict and COVID-19 by reducing risks and vulnerabilities and increasing community capacities. It will also address needs exacerbated by the ongoing pre-drought conditions as a result of poor rainfall, impact of floods in 2020 and the ongoing locust infestation. The project will employ participatory and community-based and right based approaches as well as age, gender, diversity and inclusion to ensure vulnerable communities receive adequate and quality responses. Key interventions will include protection monitoring and assessments, strengthening of existing referral pathways. Community based mechanisms will be strengthened to prevent and respond to protection concerns. \n\n\nWASH activities will focus on both immediate and sustainable intervention that include improved access to safe water. DRC will carry out rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures, construction of new water infrastructures, water trucking, establishment of gender balanced water management committees, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects, installation of new sanitation facilities (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) in settlements hosting newly displaced population and hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.)\nThe project will target to reach 30,000 individuals\u2019 people (7000 men, 8000, women, 7000 boys, 8000 girls).",

Besides construction of 50 Transitional Shelters, 575 HHs will also be supported in Baidoa through provision of locally purchased Non-Food Items (NFIs) through cash, provision of 575 Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) to the same HHs through cash, settlement (re)planning training to reduce congestion, overcrowding and provide dignified living to beneficiaries. \n\nIn order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in Baidoa and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called 'Kobo Tool box' to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with 'Do No Harm' principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $213 (80% or $170 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $43 as the second installment) for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . Beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . This criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use monitoring and evaluation (MampE) tools, that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. Thus, in total, 625 HHs (575 through ESK, 575 through NFIs and 50 HH through Transitional Shelters) or 3,750 individuals (50% females) will be assisted in Baidoa through this project. A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash, impact of the response and to generate lessons learned for future programming. Similarly, for the transitional shelters, a post construction monitoring exercise will be conducted after 3 month of the construction completion.",

The camps have been selected on the basis of need, high proportion of the newly arrived, lack of similar support and accessibility. The needs of the beneficiaries have been identified through a joint rapid needs assessment conducted by HAPEN and DRC in March 2021.\n\nThe target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) are living in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that compromise their privacy, physical security and protection from weather extremes. The families lack adequate access to NFIs, having lost them during displacement.\n\nHAPEN will distribute Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) and non-food items (NFI) kits to 2333 households, including 230 host households who are equally vulnerable in the interest of Do-No Harm principle and in support of reintegration. An owner-driven approach in the construction of shelters where beneficiaries are assisted and capacitated to undertake the construction. The process will enable them to undertake basic repairs using local materials or rebuild their shelters in future, thus contributing to sustainability of the benefits beyond the project period. On monitoring, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution of NFIs and ESKs respectively. The exercises will provide beneficiary feedback on project effectiveness and will target 90% of the beneficiaries to ensure proper representation and accuracy.\n\nTo ensure accountability, HAPEN will establish community response and feedback mechanisms (CRFM) in the targeted sites. This will be comprised of a CRFM desk and a hotline to offer a channel for beneficiaries to register concerns. \n\nHAPEN will work closely with local administration to plan distribution points, schedules and instill order during the exercises to minimize protection risks. The timing and locations of all distributions will put the safety of women, girls, boys, elderly, disabled and those with limited mobility into consideration. Distribution exercises will be done within reasonable daylight hours. Distances to distribution sites and facilities provided by the project will be minimal and safe. It will be made clear that support provided by the project will be at no cost to the beneficiaries, hence no favours should be solicited from beneficiaries. COVID-19 prevention measures will be observed at all points where project requires beneficiaries, leaders or partners to gather. In general, the project will address protection risks and inclusion of women, disabled and minorities at all stages.\n\nCommunity structures including project community committees will play key roles in decision making, implementation and monitoring of activities and will be comprised of men, women and representatives of the disabled and the minority. \n\nIn particular, this project will closely coordinate and harmonize with Protection, WASH, CCCM and Housing, Land amp Property (HLP)  interventions to be implemented by other partners (DRC, SEDHURO and  NOFYL)  in the same district or camps and in general all other initiatives in the district to ensure complementarity. Under the coordination arrangements, organizations implementing different projects will plan together and share information during the selection of beneficiaries to avoid duplication.",

Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs and emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. As hygiene promoters will interact closely with students during hygiene promotion sessions and recreational activities, CISP will train this cadre on hygiene promotion, psycho-social support (PSS), and child protection and safeguarding. Specific Protection activities will include the mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, and awareness raising and training of community education committees (CEC) on child protection. CISP will also continue to engage with Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE) and train cluster partners and MoE staffs on safe schools contingency planning, DRR and emergency response. CISP will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, proposal development, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, CISP will provide cash grants to CECs. In return, CECs will contribute in-kind or cash to procure safe water and manage its distribution to students. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacity and improve school preparedness against armed attack and other natural disasters. Disability and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. CISP will coordinate enrollment drives through MoE and with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. CISP education department will utilize the existing synergies with CISP protection department to assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, and, as determined from the assessment results, targeted schools will develop appropriate action plans to address areas of concern. To measure the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, CISP will conduct an end line assessment. Through the CISP protection department engagement with CEC\u2019s and the regional Gender Focal Points (GFP\u2019s) of MoE, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

        "description": "Det l\u00e5nga inb\u00f6rdeskriget i Somalia har resulterat i stora flyktingstr\u00f6mmar d\u00e4r somalier har spritts \u00f6ver v\u00e4rlden, vilket har medf\u00f6rt en \"brain drain\" av Somalia. Den stora somaliska diasporan har \u00e4ven skaffat sig erfarenheter och utbildning i de l\u00e4nder de har flyttat till. Den somaliska diasporan har dessutom ett mycket aktivt f\u00f6reningsliv, stora remitteringar till Somalia och f\u00f6ljer den politiska utvecklingen i sitt forna hemland mycket noga. Detta reflekteras \u00e4ven i Resultatstrategin f\u00f6r Sveriges internationella bist\u00e5nd till Somalia 2013-2017, d\u00e5 diasporans bidrag till utvecklingen i Somalia skall st\u00f6djas. Forum Syds diasporaprogram i Somalia 2015-2017 bidrar till att komplettera de finansiella remitteringarna med sociala remitteringar f\u00f6r att st\u00e4rka marginaliserade grupper och st\u00e4rka det svaga civilsamh\u00e4llet i Somalia. Det kompletterar \u00e4ven andra utvecklingsinsatser genom internationella organisationer och FN och bidrar mer direkt till att bygga somalisk kapacitet f\u00f6r att hantera Somalias utvecklingshinder. Dessutom kompletterar programmet Sidas st\u00f6d f\u00f6r diaspora experter att \u00e5terv\u00e4nda och arbeta f\u00f6r ministerier i Somalia vilket implementeras av IOM samt ett planerat st\u00f6d inriktat p\u00e5 den privata sektorn.   \n\nDet stora engagemanget fr\u00e5n den somaliska diasporan \u00e4r grunden f\u00f6r Forum Syds program, vilket bygger vidare p\u00e5 en pilotfas som har genomf\u00f6rts 2012-2014 med st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n Sida. Det f\u00f6reslagna programmet ut\u00f6kar och f\u00f6rdjupar programmet j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med pilotfasen och det syftet \u00e4r att diasporan skall bidra till att \"Marginaliserade grupper, framf\u00f6rallt kvinnor och ungdomar (r\u00e4ttighetsinnehavare) och civilsamh\u00e4llesorganisationer har \u00f6kat deltagande i beslutsprocesser i Somalia\". Det \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let \u00e4r sedan nedbruten i delm\u00e5l vilka inkluderar fokus p\u00e5 demokrati och m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, h\u00e5llbar f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, regionala initiativ (f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka kontakten mellan olika regioner i Somalia, fr\u00e4mst med fokus p\u00e5 civilsamh\u00e4llet) och kapacitetsbyggande. \n\nDetta program forts\u00e4tter och ut\u00f6kar den vidaref\u00f6rmedling av medel till diaspora organisationer f\u00f6r projekt i Somalia tillsammans med lokala partners som har anv\u00e4nts under pilotfasen 2012-2014. Men programmet ut\u00f6kas \u00e4ven med ett \"regionalt initiativ\" vilket syftar till att \u00f6verbrygga den fragmentering av Somalia som inb\u00f6rdeskriget har skapat genom att engagera civilsamh\u00e4llet i olika delar av landet f\u00f6r att \u00e5teruppbygga f\u00f6rtroendet mellan olika grupper.

        "description": "Det l\u00e5nga inb\u00f6rdeskriget i Somalia har resulterat i stora flyktingstr\u00f6mmar d\u00e4r somalier har spritts \u00f6ver v\u00e4rlden, vilket har medf\u00f6rt en \"brain drain\" av Somalia. Den stora somaliska diasporan har \u00e4ven skaffat sig erfarenheter och utbildning i de l\u00e4nder de har flyttat till. Den somaliska diasporan har dessutom ett mycket aktivt f\u00f6reningsliv, stora remitteringar till Somalia och f\u00f6ljer den politiska utvecklingen i sitt forna hemland mycket noga. Detta reflekteras \u00e4ven i Resultatstrategin f\u00f6r Sveriges internationella bist\u00e5nd till Somalia 2013-2017, d\u00e5 diasporans bidrag till utvecklingen i Somalia skall st\u00f6djas. Forum Syds diasporaprogram i Somalia 2015-2017 bidrar till att komplettera de finansiella remitteringarna med sociala remitteringar f\u00f6r att st\u00e4rka marginaliserade grupper och st\u00e4rka det svaga civilsamh\u00e4llet i Somalia. Det kompletterar \u00e4ven andra utvecklingsinsatser genom internationella organisationer och FN och bidrar mer direkt till att bygga somalisk kapacitet f\u00f6r att hantera Somalias utvecklingshinder. Dessutom kompletterar programmet Sidas st\u00f6d f\u00f6r diaspora experter att \u00e5terv\u00e4nda och arbeta f\u00f6r ministerier i Somalia vilket implementeras av IOM samt ett planerat st\u00f6d inriktat p\u00e5 den privata sektorn.   \n\nDet stora engagemanget fr\u00e5n den somaliska diasporan \u00e4r grunden f\u00f6r Forum Syds program, vilket bygger vidare p\u00e5 en pilotfas som har genomf\u00f6rts 2012-2014 med st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n Sida. Det f\u00f6reslagna programmet ut\u00f6kar och f\u00f6rdjupar programmet j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med pilotfasen och det syftet \u00e4r att diasporan skall bidra till att \"Marginaliserade grupper, framf\u00f6rallt kvinnor och ungdomar (r\u00e4ttighetsinnehavare) och civilsamh\u00e4llesorganisationer har \u00f6kat deltagande i beslutsprocesser i Somalia\". Det \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let \u00e4r sedan nedbruten i delm\u00e5l vilka inkluderar fokus p\u00e5 demokrati och m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, h\u00e5llbar f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, regionala initiativ (f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka kontakten mellan olika regioner i Somalia, fr\u00e4mst med fokus p\u00e5 civilsamh\u00e4llet) och kapacitetsbyggande. \n\nDetta program forts\u00e4tter och ut\u00f6kar den vidaref\u00f6rmedling av medel till diaspora organisationer f\u00f6r projekt i Somalia tillsammans med lokala partners som har anv\u00e4nts under pilotfasen 2012-2014. Men programmet ut\u00f6kas \u00e4ven med ett \"regionalt initiativ\" vilket syftar till att \u00f6verbrygga den fragmentering av Somalia som inb\u00f6rdeskriget har skapat genom att engagera civilsamh\u00e4llet i olika delar av landet f\u00f6r att \u00e5teruppbygga f\u00f6rtroendet mellan olika grupper.

        "description": "Den nuvarande utvecklingen i Somalia och det f\u00f6rnyade \u00e5tagandet fr\u00e5n det internationella samfundet att st\u00f6tta Somalia p\u00e5 v\u00e4gen till l\u00e5ngsiktig fred och statsbyggande har \u00f6ppnat upp nya m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r Sverige att engagera sig f\u00f6r f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring i landet. Som framh\u00e4vts i Somali Compact och The Economic Recovery Plan, ligger jobbskapande, ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt och n\u00e4ringslivsutveckling i centrum f\u00f6r Somalias \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning. \n\nI linje med detta \u00e4r programmets \u00f6vergripande syfte att bidra till den l\u00e5ngsiktiga rekonstruktionen av det konfliktdrabbade somaliska samh\u00e4llet genom att \u00f6ka m\u00e4nsklig s\u00e4kerhet och m\u00f6jlighet till f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning. Programmets specifika syfte \u00e4r att \u00e5stadkomma detta genom jobbskapande och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad inkomst speciellt f\u00f6r kvinnor och ungdomar i hela landet.\n \nForum Syd, som blir avtalspart till ambassaden, har tillsammans med Business Sweden utarbetat detta program. Ambassaden anser att de tv\u00e5 organisationernas kompetenser och erfarenheter kompletterar varandra v\u00e4l. Medan Forum Syd har l\u00e5ng erfarenhet av den Somaliska kontexten och har samarbetat med den somaliska diasporan samt lokala intressenter i olika program f\u00f6rut s\u00e5 har Business Sweden specialistkunskap r\u00f6rande fr\u00e5gor inom aff\u00e4rsutveckling, marknadsanalys, handel och dess regelverk mm.\n\nProgrammet avser att agera katalytiskt och engagera diasporan genom att skapa en ekonomisk h\u00e4vst\u00e5ngseffekt samt underl\u00e4tta kunskaps\u00f6verf\u00f6ring. Genom att ta vara p\u00e5 entrepren\u00f6rsandan samt kulturella kopplingar till Somalia kan den somaliska diasporan i Sverige och p\u00e5 andra st\u00e4llen spela en viktig roll i att skapa jobb f\u00f6r befolkningen i Somalia. Dock \u00e4r det viktigt att klarg\u00f6ra att programmet inte bara riktar sig till diasporan utan alla som vill investera i landet.  \n\nProgrammet har ett brett tillv\u00e4gag\u00e5ngs\u00e4tt som utg\u00f6rs av fyra st\u00f6rre best\u00e5ndsdelar som avser att komplettera varandra: \n1. A Capacity Development Facility (CDF) f\u00f6r intresserade entrepren\u00f6rer och potentiella f\u00f6rm\u00e5nstagare. CDF kommer att delas in i generell kapacitetsutveckling i f\u00f6retagsutveckling i Somalia liksom en skr\u00e4ddarsydd kapacitetsutveckling f\u00f6r f\u00f6rm\u00e5nstagare. \n2. A Challenge Fund som erbjuder finansiering till entrepren\u00f6rer vid ett tidigt stadium av en aff\u00e4rssatsning f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra utforskandet av nya m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r jobbskapande aff\u00e4rsverksamheter.    \n3. St\u00f6d till entrepren\u00f6rer f\u00f6r att s\u00f6ka ytterligare finansiering fr\u00e5n andra st\u00f6rre finansieringsk\u00e4llor. \n4. En uppskalningsanalys som avser att samla och f\u00f6rmedla analyserad marknadsdata och brister i aff\u00e4rsmilj\u00f6n i landet via den nya koordineringsarkitekturen och especiellt Fred och Stabilitetsm\u00e5l nr.4 (The New Deal/ PSG4) policyniv\u00e5 f\u00f6r f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrade policys som bidrar till att gynnsam milj\u00f6 f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsverksamhet i hela landet. \n\nGenom att f\u00f6rena dessa fyra komponenter avser programmet att skapa f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r ett framg\u00e5ngsrikt och h\u00e5llbart f\u00f6retagande och d\u00e4rigenom \u00f6kat produktivt jobbskapande. Diasporans engagemang kommer inte bara att generera kapital och aff\u00e4rsverksamheter utan ocks\u00e5 bidra till en l\u00e5ngsiktig kunskaps\u00f6verf\u00f6ring. Dessutom s\u00e5 f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas datan som samlats via uppskalningsanalysen bidra till positiva f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar p\u00e5 policyniv\u00e5 och d\u00e4rigenom positiva inverkan p\u00e5 nationell niv\u00e5.   \n\nProgrammet har identifierat stora m\u00f6jligheter inom vissa sektorer som tros ha potential till st\u00f6rre genomslagskraft p\u00e5 tillv\u00e4xt och d\u00e4rigenom bidra till produktivt jobbskapande. De identifierade sektorerna \u00e4r: Jordbruk, fiske, h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rd, ICT, f\u00f6rnybar energi samt vatten och sanitet. Medan projekt av h\u00f6g kvalitet inom dessa sektorer kommer att prioriteras s\u00e5 kommer programmets fokus att ligga p\u00e5 produktivt jobbskapande p\u00e5 ett h\u00e5llbart s\u00e4tt i alla m\u00f6jliga sektorer.",

        "description": "Den nuvarande utvecklingen i Somalia och det f\u00f6rnyade \u00e5tagandet fr\u00e5n det internationella samfundet att st\u00f6tta Somalia p\u00e5 v\u00e4gen till l\u00e5ngsiktig fred och statsbyggande har \u00f6ppnat upp nya m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r Sverige att engagera sig f\u00f6r f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring i landet. Som framh\u00e4vts i Somali Compact och The Economic Recovery Plan, ligger jobbskapande, ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt och n\u00e4ringslivsutveckling i centrum f\u00f6r Somalias \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning. \n\nI linje med detta \u00e4r programmets \u00f6vergripande syfte att bidra till den l\u00e5ngsiktiga rekonstruktionen av det konfliktdrabbade somaliska samh\u00e4llet genom att \u00f6ka m\u00e4nsklig s\u00e4kerhet och m\u00f6jlighet till f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning. Programmets specifika syfte \u00e4r att \u00e5stadkomma detta genom jobbskapande och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad inkomst speciellt f\u00f6r kvinnor och ungdomar i hela landet.\n \nForum Syd, som blir avtalspart till ambassaden, har tillsammans med Business Sweden utarbetat detta program. Ambassaden anser att de tv\u00e5 organisationernas kompetenser och erfarenheter kompletterar varandra v\u00e4l. Medan Forum Syd har l\u00e5ng erfarenhet av den Somaliska kontexten och har samarbetat med den somaliska diasporan samt lokala intressenter i olika program f\u00f6rut s\u00e5 har Business Sweden specialistkunskap r\u00f6rande fr\u00e5gor inom aff\u00e4rsutveckling, marknadsanalys, handel och dess regelverk mm.\n\nProgrammet avser att agera katalytiskt och engagera diasporan genom att skapa en ekonomisk h\u00e4vst\u00e5ngseffekt samt underl\u00e4tta kunskaps\u00f6verf\u00f6ring. Genom att ta vara p\u00e5 entrepren\u00f6rsandan samt kulturella kopplingar till Somalia kan den somaliska diasporan i Sverige och p\u00e5 andra st\u00e4llen spela en viktig roll i att skapa jobb f\u00f6r befolkningen i Somalia. Dock \u00e4r det viktigt att klarg\u00f6ra att programmet inte bara riktar sig till diasporan utan alla som vill investera i landet.  \n\nProgrammet har ett brett tillv\u00e4gag\u00e5ngs\u00e4tt som utg\u00f6rs av fyra st\u00f6rre best\u00e5ndsdelar som avser att komplettera varandra: \n1. A Capacity Development Facility (CDF) f\u00f6r intresserade entrepren\u00f6rer och potentiella f\u00f6rm\u00e5nstagare. CDF kommer att delas in i generell kapacitetsutveckling i f\u00f6retagsutveckling i Somalia liksom en skr\u00e4ddarsydd kapacitetsutveckling f\u00f6r f\u00f6rm\u00e5nstagare. \n2. A Challenge Fund som erbjuder finansiering till entrepren\u00f6rer vid ett tidigt stadium av en aff\u00e4rssatsning f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra utforskandet av nya m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r jobbskapande aff\u00e4rsverksamheter.    \n3. St\u00f6d till entrepren\u00f6rer f\u00f6r att s\u00f6ka ytterligare finansiering fr\u00e5n andra st\u00f6rre finansieringsk\u00e4llor. \n4. En uppskalningsanalys som avser att samla och f\u00f6rmedla analyserad marknadsdata och brister i aff\u00e4rsmilj\u00f6n i landet via den nya koordineringsarkitekturen och especiellt Fred och Stabilitetsm\u00e5l nr.4 (The New Deal/ PSG4) policyniv\u00e5 f\u00f6r f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrade policys som bidrar till att gynnsam milj\u00f6 f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsverksamhet i hela landet. \n\nGenom att f\u00f6rena dessa fyra komponenter avser programmet att skapa f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r ett framg\u00e5ngsrikt och h\u00e5llbart f\u00f6retagande och d\u00e4rigenom \u00f6kat produktivt jobbskapande. Diasporans engagemang kommer inte bara att generera kapital och aff\u00e4rsverksamheter utan ocks\u00e5 bidra till en l\u00e5ngsiktig kunskaps\u00f6verf\u00f6ring. Dessutom s\u00e5 f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas datan som samlats via uppskalningsanalysen bidra till positiva f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar p\u00e5 policyniv\u00e5 och d\u00e4rigenom positiva inverkan p\u00e5 nationell niv\u00e5.   \n\nProgrammet har identifierat stora m\u00f6jligheter inom vissa sektorer som tros ha potential till st\u00f6rre genomslagskraft p\u00e5 tillv\u00e4xt och d\u00e4rigenom bidra till produktivt jobbskapande. De identifierade sektorerna \u00e4r: Jordbruk, fiske, h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rd, ICT, f\u00f6rnybar energi samt vatten och sanitet. Medan projekt av h\u00f6g kvalitet inom dessa sektorer kommer att prioriteras s\u00e5 kommer programmets fokus att ligga p\u00e5 produktivt jobbskapande p\u00e5 ett h\u00e5llbart s\u00e4tt i alla m\u00f6jliga sektorer.",

De Globla riktlinjerna som \u00e4r obligatoriska att f\u00f6lja f\u00f6r samtliga fonder lanserades av OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef (ERC) i februari 2015. Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och st\u00e4rkts p\u00e5 ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen st\u00e4rker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppf\u00f6ljning p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5).  \n\nGivare har en r\u00e5dgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen \u201dAdvisory Board (AB)\u201d samt det globala r\u00e5dgivande forumet \u201dPooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, som b\u00e5da sk\u00f6ts av OCHA.

Sida har dessutom sedan 2013 etablerat rutiner f\u00f6r regulj\u00e4r uppf\u00f6ljning av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna samt st\u00e4rkt l\u00e4nken mellan projektuppf\u00f6ljningen i f\u00e4lt och konkreta dialogfr\u00e5gor som f\u00f6rs p\u00e5 global niv\u00e5. Under 2017 f\u00f6ljde Sida upp 16 av 18 landfonder (ej Centralafrikanska republiken och Jemen). \n\nSveriges roll i CBPFs/humanit\u00e4ra landfonder (tidigare kallade CHFer och ERFer)\nSverige har sedan uppr\u00e4ttandet av den f\u00f6rsta CBPFen (1997 i Angola) varit en p\u00e5drivande kraft i st\u00e4rkandet av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna. Det svenska finansiella och politiska st\u00f6det till fonderna har ytterligare st\u00e4rkts med \u00e5ren, d\u00e5 fr\u00e5gan om lokal f\u00f6rankring samt humanit\u00e4r samordning blivit centrala i \u201dStrategin f\u00f6r Sveriges humanit\u00e4ra bist\u00e5nd genom Styrelsen f\u00f6r internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (Sida) 2017-2020\u201d. \u00c5r 2015 f\u00f6rst\u00e4rktes denna position ytterligare genom en internationell h\u00f6gniv\u00e5 panel om humanit\u00e4r finansiering som tillsats av FNs Generalsekreterare och i vilken utrikesminister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m deltog. En av panelens huvudrekommendationer var att \u00f6ka st\u00f6det till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna i syfte att effektivisera det humanit\u00e4ra systemet.\n\nVal av CBPFer f\u00f6r Sida st\u00f6d har skett p\u00e5 basis av Sidas behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess. I vilken humanit\u00e4ra kriser i v\u00e4rlden analyseras utifr\u00e5n de humanit\u00e4ra principerna, i synnerhet opartiskhets principen. Sedan f\u00f6resl\u00e5s de mest relevanta partners f\u00f6r st\u00f6d i respektive kris. Den planerade insatsen att st\u00f6dja FNs humanit\u00e4ra landfonder \u00e4r avst\u00e4mt med UD inom ramen f\u00f6r HUMSAM och \u00e4r i linje med 2018 \u00e5rs humanit\u00e4ra allokering. Sverige \u00e4r idag globalt den tredje st\u00f6rsta givaren till CBPFerna. \n\nSida kommer att inom ramen f\u00f6r denna beredning ing\u00e5 avtal med tv\u00e5 parter, d\u00e5 fonderna formellt administreras av OCHA respektive Multi Partner Trust Fund Office/United Nations Development Programme (MPTFO/UNDP). \n\nAvtalet 2018 med OCHA g\u00e4ller elva humanit\u00e4ra landfonder som inbegrips i ett och samma avtal och som f\u00f6ljer samma format som tidigare \u00e5rs avtal med OCHA. \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Etiopien (35 MSEK), Irak (15 MSEK), Jemen (50 MSEK), Myanmar (10 MSEK), Pakistan (23 MSEK), Syrien (20 MSEK), Jordanien/Syrenkrisen (20 MSEK), Libanon/Syrienkrisen (15 MSEK),Turkiet/Syrienkrisen (25 MSEK) Palestina (15 MSEK) och Nigeria (20 MSEK). \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen f\u00f6r avtalet 2018 med MPTFO/UNDP \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Afghanistan (60 MSEK), Central Afrikanska Republiken (12 MSEK), Demokratiska Republiken Kongo (80 MSEK), Syd Sudan (48 MSEK), Sudan (57 MSEK), samt Somalia (35 MSEK). \n\nSida f\u00f6resl\u00e5s besluta om ytterligare finansiering 2018 med 540 000 000 SEK (varav 24 MSEK beslutats om tidigare) i ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till nuvarande avtal med OCHA samt ett till\u00e4ggsavtal med MPTFO/UNDP till sammanlagt sjutton landfonder. Sida bed\u00f6mer att samtliga medel skall utbetalas i b\u00f6rjan p\u00e5 \u00e5ret f\u00f6r att p\u00e5 b\u00e4sta s\u00e4tt m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra planering och genomf\u00f6rande av humanit\u00e4ra insatser utan f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. \n\nGenom en enhetlig beredning som inbegriper alla sjutton fonder st\u00e4rks den humanit\u00e4ra enhets kapacitet att arbeta mer systematiskt med de sjutton fonderna. Fr\u00e4mst genom j\u00e4mf\u00f6rande landanalyser samt en sammanh\u00e5llen uppf\u00f6ljningsstruktur, i vilken ambassader och den humanit\u00e4ra enheten ing\u00e5r. En annan f\u00f6rdel med sammanslagningen av beredningen \u00e4r att ambassaderna kan frig\u00f6ra ytterligare resurser till fortl\u00f6pande uppf\u00f6ljning av fondernas effektivitet i f\u00e4lt, samt att Sida kan fokusera ytterligare p\u00e5 strategiska fr\u00e5gor inom ramen f\u00f6r de nationella r\u00e5dgivande styrgrupperna, \u201dAdvisory Boards\u201d. Det b\u00f6r \u00e4ven understrykas att arbetet med beredningen skett i n\u00e4ra samarbete med ber\u00f6rda ambassader. \n\nBed\u00f6mningspromemorian har skrivits p\u00e5 engelska med anledning av att engelskspr\u00e5kig personal i f\u00e4lt \u00e4r delaktig i beredning och uppf\u00f6ljning av insatsen, i enlighet med Generaldirekt\u00f6rens beslut om Sidas spr\u00e5kvalsmatris med till\u00e4mpningsanvisningar fr\u00e5n 1 mars 2013. En sammanslagning av tidigare sju snarlika beredningar \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 en del av Sidas f\u00f6renklingsagenda och frig\u00f6r tid f\u00f6r mer strategisk uppf\u00f6ljning och dialog.\n\nDetta \u00e4r ett kompletterande insatsbeslut i enlighet med 3.11.3 i Sidas insatshanteringsregel. Detta beslut bygger i stora delar vidare p\u00e5 den bed\u00f6mning som gjordes 2016 samt den uppdaterade bed\u00f6mning som beslutades om i februari 2017.

Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och st\u00e4rkts p\u00e5 ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen st\u00e4rker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppf\u00f6ljning p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5).  \n\nGivare har en r\u00e5dgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen \u201dAdvisory Board (AB)\u201d samt det globala r\u00e5dgivande forumet \u201dPooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, som b\u00e5da sk\u00f6ts av OCHA. Sida har en stark tradition att vara aktiv i b\u00e4gge sammanhangen genom ambassaderna och den humanit\u00e4ra enhetens fortl\u00f6pande arbete p\u00e5 nationell och global niv\u00e5. Sida har dessutom sedan 2013 etablerat rutiner f\u00f6r regulj\u00e4r uppf\u00f6ljning av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna samt st\u00e4rkt l\u00e4nken mellan projektuppf\u00f6ljningen i f\u00e4lt och konkreta dialogfr\u00e5gor som f\u00f6rs p\u00e5 global niv\u00e5. Under 2017 f\u00f6ljde Sida upp 16 av 18 landfonder (ej Centralafrikanska republiken och Jemen). \n\nSveriges roll i CBPFs/humanit\u00e4ra landfonder (tidigare kallade CHFer och ERFer)\nSverige har sedan uppr\u00e4ttandet av den f\u00f6rsta CBPFen (1997 i Angola) varit en p\u00e5drivande kraft i st\u00e4rkandet av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna. Det svenska finansiella och politiska st\u00f6det till fonderna har ytterligare st\u00e4rkts med \u00e5ren, d\u00e5 fr\u00e5gan om lokal f\u00f6rankring samt humanit\u00e4r samordning blivit centrala i \u201dStrategin f\u00f6r Sveriges humanit\u00e4ra bist\u00e5nd genom Styrelsen f\u00f6r internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (Sida) 2017-2020\u201d. \u00c5r 2015 f\u00f6rst\u00e4rktes denna position ytterligare genom en internationell h\u00f6gniv\u00e5 panel om humanit\u00e4r finansiering som tillsats av FNs Generalsekreterare och i vilken utrikesminister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m deltog. En av panelens huvudrekommendationer var att \u00f6ka st\u00f6det till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna i syfte att effektivisera det humanit\u00e4ra systemet.\n\nVal av CBPFer f\u00f6r Sida st\u00f6d har skett p\u00e5 basis av Sidas behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess. I vilken humanit\u00e4ra kriser i v\u00e4rlden analyseras utifr\u00e5n de humanit\u00e4ra principerna, i synnerhet opartiskhets principen. Sedan f\u00f6resl\u00e5s de mest relevanta partners f\u00f6r st\u00f6d i respektive kris. Den planerade insatsen att st\u00f6dja FNs humanit\u00e4ra landfonder \u00e4r avst\u00e4mt med UD inom ramen f\u00f6r HUMSAM och \u00e4r i linje med 2018 \u00e5rs humanit\u00e4ra allokering. Sverige \u00e4r idag globalt den tredje st\u00f6rsta givaren till CBPFerna. \n\nSida kommer att inom ramen f\u00f6r denna beredning ing\u00e5 avtal med tv\u00e5 parter, d\u00e5 fonderna formellt administreras av OCHA respektive Multi Partner Trust Fund Office/United Nations Development Programme (MPTFO/UNDP). \n\nAvtalet 2018 med OCHA g\u00e4ller elva humanit\u00e4ra landfonder som inbegrips i ett och samma avtal och som f\u00f6ljer samma format som tidigare \u00e5rs avtal med OCHA. \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Etiopien (35 MSEK), Irak (15 MSEK), Jemen (50 MSEK), Myanmar (10 MSEK), Pakistan (23 MSEK), Syrien (20 MSEK), Jordanien/Syrenkrisen (20 MSEK), Libanon/Syrienkrisen (15 MSEK),Turkiet/Syrienkrisen (25 MSEK) Palestina (15 MSEK) och Nigeria (20 MSEK). \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen f\u00f6r avtalet 2018 med MPTFO/UNDP \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Afghanistan (60 MSEK), Central Afrikanska Republiken (12 MSEK), Demokratiska Republiken Kongo (80 MSEK), Syd Sudan (48 MSEK), Sudan (57 MSEK), samt Somalia (35 MSEK). \n\nSida f\u00f6resl\u00e5s besluta om ytterligare finansiering 2018 med 540 000 000 SEK (varav 24 MSEK beslutats om tidigare) i ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till nuvarande avtal med OCHA samt ett till\u00e4ggsavtal med MPTFO/UNDP till sammanlagt sjutton landfonder. Sida bed\u00f6mer att samtliga medel skall utbetalas i b\u00f6rjan p\u00e5 \u00e5ret f\u00f6r att p\u00e5 b\u00e4sta s\u00e4tt m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra planering och genomf\u00f6rande av humanit\u00e4ra insatser utan f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. \n\nGenom en enhetlig beredning som inbegriper alla sjutton fonder st\u00e4rks den humanit\u00e4ra enhets kapacitet att arbeta mer systematiskt med de sjutton fonderna. Fr\u00e4mst genom j\u00e4mf\u00f6rande landanalyser samt en sammanh\u00e5llen uppf\u00f6ljningsstruktur, i vilken ambassader och den humanit\u00e4ra enheten ing\u00e5r. En annan f\u00f6rdel med sammanslagningen av beredningen \u00e4r att ambassaderna kan frig\u00f6ra ytterligare resurser till fortl\u00f6pande uppf\u00f6ljning av fondernas effektivitet i f\u00e4lt, samt att Sida kan fokusera ytterligare p\u00e5 strategiska fr\u00e5gor inom ramen f\u00f6r de nationella r\u00e5dgivande styrgrupperna, \u201dAdvisory Boards\u201d. Det b\u00f6r \u00e4ven understrykas att arbetet med beredningen skett i n\u00e4ra samarbete med ber\u00f6rda ambassader. \n\nBed\u00f6mningspromemorian har skrivits p\u00e5 engelska med anledning av att engelskspr\u00e5kig personal i f\u00e4lt \u00e4r delaktig i beredning och uppf\u00f6ljning av insatsen, i enlighet med Generaldirekt\u00f6rens beslut om Sidas spr\u00e5kvalsmatris med till\u00e4mpningsanvisningar fr\u00e5n 1 mars 2013. En sammanslagning av tidigare sju snarlika beredningar \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 en del av Sidas f\u00f6renklingsagenda och frig\u00f6r tid f\u00f6r mer strategisk uppf\u00f6ljning och dialog.\n\nDetta \u00e4r ett kompletterande insatsbeslut i enlighet med 3.11.3 i Sidas insatshanteringsregel. Detta beslut bygger i stora delar vidare p\u00e5 den bed\u00f6mning som gjordes 2016 samt den uppdaterade bed\u00f6mning som beslutades om i februari 2017. Sida anser att bed\u00f6mningen fr\u00e5n tidigare \u00e5r kvarst\u00e5r som relevant. Den ursprungliga bed\u00f6mningen har uppdaterats i relevanta delar.",

OPC \u00e4r f\u00f6rankrat i den internationella arbetarr\u00f6relsen i de specifika landkontexter d\u00e4r projekten genomf\u00f6rs via lokala partnerorganisationer. Organisationen bildades i sin nuvarande form 1992 som den svenska arbetarr\u00f6relsens samarbetsorganisation f\u00f6r internationell verksamhet och opinionsbildning. OPC \u00e4r en av Sidas strategiska partnerorganisationer (SPO) och har ett p\u00e5g\u00e5ende samarbete med Sida inom regeringens CSO-strategi 2016 - 2022. OPC har \u00e4ven ett flertal st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n andra samarbetsstrategier. Det \u00f6vergripande programm\u00e5let \u00e4r \"st\u00e4rka civila samh\u00e4llet och progressiv utveckling f\u00f6r demokrati, j\u00e4mlikhet och h\u00e5llbarhet.\" \n\nOPC arbetar integrerat med tre huvudomr\u00e5den inom det internationella utvecklingssamarbetet: \n- folkligt deltagande \n- fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete \n- partipolitisk organisering (st\u00f6ds ej inom CSO-strategin.) \n\nOPC samarbetar i sina projekt med 27 olika medlemsorganisationer (MO) tex ABF, LO och Unga \u00d6rnar. Ett projekt innefattar oftast \u00e4ven samarbete med en lokal organisation d.v.s. en partnerorganisation (PO).\n\nSidas bed\u00f6mning \u00e4r att OPC har en unik kompetens och l\u00e5ng praktisk erfarenhet av demokratiutveckling och fattigdomsbek\u00e4mpning i Sverige och internationellt. Med expertis i st\u00e4rkandet av r\u00e4ttigheter, organisering och fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete, utg\u00f6r OPC en v\u00e4rdefull partner i samarbetet med Sida. \n\nOPC har sju lokalkontor i Asien, S\u00f6dra Afrika och p\u00e5 V\u00e4stra Balkan. Kontoren best\u00e5r av 1-3 anst\u00e4llda. OPC arbetar n\u00e4ra sina partnerorganisationer och \u00e4r uppskattade i dessa partnerskap. OPC bygger sitt arbete kring internationell solidaritet och erbjuder sina samarbetspartner kontakter inom internationella n\u00e4tverk. OPC genomf\u00f6r kurser om bl.a. kvinnors r\u00e4ttigheter, organisationsfrihet samt st\u00e4rker marginaliserade grupper om hur de kan utkr\u00e4va sina r\u00e4ttigheter. De st\u00e4rker sina partnerorganisationers kapacitet s\u00e5 att dessa i sin tur effektivare ska kunna f\u00f6retr\u00e4da sina medlemmar. St\u00f6det ska leda till att partnerorganisationerna kan verka som demokratiska f\u00f6rebilder och p\u00e5verka or\u00e4ttvisa samh\u00e4llsstrukturer.\n\nOPC OCH SIDAS SAMARBETE\nUnder tidigare avtalsperioder och under den nu p\u00e5g\u00e5ende avtalsperioden har Sida konstaterat att OPC vidareutvecklats inom flera omr\u00e5den. Sida har bl.a. noterat att OPC st\u00e4rkt sina system f\u00f6r intern styrning och kontroll samt att programmen \u00e4r mer logiskt sammanh\u00e4ngande. Det \u00e4r framsteg som Sida ser mycket positivt p\u00e5. Samtidigt har Sida ocks\u00e5  bed\u00f6mt en del omr\u00e5den som mindre tillfredsst\u00e4llande, bl.a. bristande f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att f\u00f6lja upp avvikelse\u00e4renden och l\u00e5ngsam omst\u00e4llning fr\u00e5n projektst\u00f6d till k\u00e4rnst\u00f6d. Vad g\u00e4ller integreringen av de tematiska perspektiven s\u00e5 har tydliga framsteg gjorts men \u00e4n \u00e5terst\u00e5r mycket arbete, s\u00e4rskilt vad g\u00e4ller milj\u00f6 och klimat samt j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet.\n\nANS\u00d6KAN F\u00d6R 2020-2024\nDen h\u00e4r insatsen avses finansieras under \"CSO-strategin 2016-2022\" samt \"Myanmarstrategin 2018-2022.\" Ans\u00f6kan inkluderar flera program som ryms inom ett \u00f6vergripande program kopplat till CSO-strategin samt ett landprogram f\u00f6r Myanmar. Det \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let f\u00f6r programmet \u00e4r att st\u00e4rka civila samh\u00e4llet och progressiv utveckling f\u00f6r demokrati, j\u00e4mlikhet och h\u00e5llbarhet. Ans\u00f6kan baserar sig p\u00e5 OPC:s internationella strategi 2020-2025. OPC:s f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringsteori utg\u00e5r fr\u00e5n fyra olika slags akt\u00f6rer: beslutsfattare, r\u00e4ttighetsb\u00e4rare, n\u00e4tverk/allianser och partnerorganisationer. Programmens fokus \u00e4r hur dessa akt\u00f6rer kan samverka f\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 progressiv utveckling.  \n\nVad OPC menar med \"progressiv utveckling\" kommer till uttryck i OPC:s fem politiska prioriteringar som \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: \n1. Motverka hot mot demokrati och m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter\n2. St\u00e4rka j\u00e4mlikhet och arbetsvillkor - bygga nya allianser and arbeta f\u00f6r progressiv politik\n3. H\u00e5llbarhet utifr\u00e5n r\u00e4ttvis omst\u00e4llning - motverka klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar\n4. Fr\u00e4mja fred och dialog - minska v\u00e4pnad konflikt och social oro\n5. Mots\u00e4tta sig tillbakag\u00e5ngen - \u00f6kad j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet\n\nDessa fem prioriteringar \u00e4r utg\u00e5ngspunkten f\u00f6r programmen. OPC arbetar med beteende- och systemf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring inom de fem politiska prioriteringarna. Enligt OPC leder beteendef\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna till att samh\u00e4llen och system blir mer demokratiska, fredliga, m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter respekteras i h\u00f6gre grad och social och ekonomisk oj\u00e4mlikhet mellan m\u00e4nniskor minskar. F\u00f6r\u00e4ndringen gagnar de grupper som har minst resurser, s\u00e4mst m\u00f6jligheter, lever i st\u00f6rst os\u00e4kerhet och har minst makt, d.v.s. de allra fattigaste. \n\nOPC st\u00f6ttar sina partnerorganisationer i deras ambition att \u00e5stadkomma samh\u00e4llsf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring. Vissa av partnerorganisationerna arbetar direkt med de allra fattigaste t.ex. i Myanmar, Sydafrika och Palestina, medan andra arbetar mot m\u00e5lgrupper inom sektorer som inte tillh\u00f6r de allra fattigaste t.ex. arbetare . Gemensamt f\u00f6r dessa insatser \u00e4r arbetss\u00e4ttet; de samarbetar genom att erbjuda organisering. \u00c4ven de partnerorganisationer som inte arbetar direkt med de allra fattigaste arbetar f\u00f6r f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring som gynnar de allra fattigaste. De grupper OPC framf\u00f6rallt fokuserar p\u00e5 \u00e4r kvinnor, marginaliserade grupper samt arbetare. \n\nSidas bed\u00f6mning \u00e4r att OPC har en relevant och logisk bredd av aktiviteter, fr\u00e5n st\u00e4rkande av r\u00e4ttigheter, utkr\u00e4vande av r\u00e4ttigheter och organisering, till strategiskt p\u00e5verkansarbete f\u00f6r att f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra lagstiftning och andra samh\u00e4llsstrukturer. \n\nI ans\u00f6kan planerar OPC verksamhet i ca 20 l\u00e4nder, inom fem regionala program och ett tematiskt program samt tre program som fokuserar p\u00e5 metodutveckling och kvalitetss\u00e4kring. Verksamheten f\u00f6rdelas p\u00e5 ca 120 partnerorganisationer, varav ca 1/3 bedrivs helt eller delvis av medlemsorganisationerna. OPC har budgetansvar f\u00f6r de resterande st\u00f6den till partnerorganisationer. N\u00e5gra av partnerorganisationerna kommer fasas ut medan andra nya organisationer fasas in under den kommande avtalsperioden. Omfattningen av verksamheten, b\u00e5de i form av inneh\u00e5ll och storlek, \u00e4r i huvudsak en forts\u00e4ttning av p\u00e5g\u00e5ende verksamhet. De planerade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna presenteras under stycke \"F\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar fr\u00e5n p\u00e5g\u00e5ende program.\"\n\nM\u00e5len \u00e4r formulerade p\u00e5 en \u00f6vergripande niv\u00e5 eftersom de ska inkludera verksamheten i 20 l\u00e4nder med sina specifika kontexter. M\u00e5len \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 formulerade mer som \u00f6nskade riktningar och tillst\u00e5nd \u00e4n som specifika situationer vid programmets slut. Detta beror fr\u00e4mst p\u00e5 att m\u00e5len syftar till att \u00e4ndra beteenden och attityder. Alla programmen kommer inte att fokusera p\u00e5 samma politiska prioriterade fr\u00e5gor men tillsammans bidrar alla programmen till de fem politiska prioriteringarna. M\u00e5lformuleringarna och indikatorer f\u00f6r verksamheten har formulerats av partnerorganisationerna och medlemsorganisationerna tillsammans med OPC, i workshops i respektive region. \n\nMilj\u00f6 och klimat, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, konfliktk\u00e4nslighet samt anti-korruption \u00e4r perspektiv som kommer att integreras i alla program. Med bl.a. personalf\u00f6rst\u00e4rkning avser OPC att arbeta med kompetensh\u00f6jande insatser, och med metodutveckling f\u00f6r b\u00e4ttre verktyg och strategier inom perspektiven. \n\nEtt av OPC:s huvudsyften \u00e4r att st\u00f6tta medlemsorganisationernas utvecklingssamarbete. F\u00f6r att ta vara p\u00e5 medlemsorganisationernas intresse och engagemang erbjuder OPC medlemmarna olika m\u00f6jligheter att delta i samarbetet med partnerorganisationer. OPC har tre olika projektstrukturer: \n\n- Fullt ansvar f\u00f6r ett projekt; medlemsorganisation har ansvar f\u00f6r alla delar av ett projekt, fr\u00e5n planering till utv\u00e4rdering. OPC vidaref\u00f6rmedlar medel till medlemsorganisationen samt kvalitetss\u00e4krar projektet. \n- Deltagande i projekt; OPC hanterar budgetansvaret. I de h\u00e4r projekten kan medlemsorganisationernas specialkunskaper i folkligt deltagande, fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete och partipolitisk organisering komma verksamheten till del \u00e4ven i de fall d\u00e5 den svenska organisationen saknar kapacitet att hantera budgetansvaret.\n- Fadder f\u00f6r ett projekt; medlemsorganisationen \u00e4r fadder f\u00f6r projektet och bidrar finansiellt till det. Den deltar i projektaktiviteter medan OPC ansvarar f\u00f6r projektets alla delar. \n\nSida anser att ett av OPC:s merv\u00e4rden \u00e4r att partnerorganisationerna kan dra nytta av medlemsorganisationernas erfarenheter, kunskap och n\u00e4tverk. \n\nBUDGET OCH ANS\u00d6KT BELOPP\nAns\u00f6kan, inklusive medel fr\u00e5n b\u00e5de CSO-strategin, Myanmarstrategin samt OPC:s egeninsats, har en total budget p\u00e5 613 208 006 SEK. Beloppet inkluderar \u00e4ven 2 000 000 SEK f\u00f6r verksamhet \u00e5r 2020 i Nordmakedonien. Under beredningen besl\u00f6ts det att insatsen i Nordmakedonien hanteras separat av den bilaterala strategin. Ans\u00f6kans reviderade total budget \u00e4r d\u00e4rf\u00f6r 611 208 006. Fr\u00e5n Sida s\u00f6ker OPC d\u00e4rmed ett bidrag p\u00e5 totalt 568 290 850 SEK f\u00f6r 2020-2024, varav det beloppet fr\u00e5n CSO-strategin \u00e4r 486 132 334 SEK. Egeninsatsen \u00e4r 10%. OPC ans\u00f6ker om en stor budget\u00f6kning, 21% av \u00e5rlig genomsnittlig budget under nuvarande avtalsperiod. F\u00f6r att visa p\u00e5 ett scenario med l\u00e4gre budget, inkom OPC i november med ett underlag d\u00e4r ans\u00f6kt belopp fr\u00e5n CSO-strategin var 471 157 666 SEK. Underlaget indikerar minskade ambitioner inom flera av de presenterade omst\u00e4llningarna i ans\u00f6kan. \n\nSida bed\u00f6mer det rimligt att OPC ans\u00f6ker om en h\u00f6gre budget i och med de f\u00f6reslagna f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna inom framf\u00f6rallt metodutveckling och intern kontroll. Sida bed\u00f6mer dock att den nuvarande verksamheten och de planerade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna kan hanteras med en mindre anslagsvolym, \u00e4n vad OPC ans\u00f6kt om. En del av de f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar som planeras har varit f\u00f6rem\u00e5l f\u00f6r m\u00e5ng\u00e5rig dialog mellan Sida och OPC och Sida bed\u00f6mer att OPC hittills inte har gjort de framsteg som f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntats. Sida anser att det \u00e4r av stor betydelse att OPC forts\u00e4tter att prioritera de presenterade omst\u00e4llningarna, \u00e4ven om den ans\u00f6kta budgeten inte beviljas i sin helhet.\n\nF\u00d6R\u00c4NDRINGAR FR\u00c5N P\u00c5G\u00c5ENDE PROGRAM\nDet f\u00f6reslagna programmet \u00e4r i stort en f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngning av det p\u00e5g\u00e5ende programmet avseende partnerorganisationer och verksamhetsl\u00e4nder. Flera av programmen \u00e4r omstrukturerade. OPC planerar f\u00f6ljande f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar inom programperioden: \n- \u00f6kade personalkostnader med 10%; f\u00f6r att vara b\u00e4ttre rustad att bedriva verksamhet i sv\u00e5ra kontexter, st\u00e4rka kapaciteten f\u00f6r internkontroll, metodst\u00f6d, och s\u00e4kerhetsfr\u00e5gor samt st\u00f6d till medlemsorganisationer i sitt samarbete med partnerorganisationer. Dessutom kr\u00e4vs \u00f6kade resurser f\u00f6r arbetet med milj\u00f6- och klimatomst\u00e4llning. Dessa f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar leder till att OPC st\u00e4rker sin f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att hantera sidamedel, b\u00e4ttre kan m\u00f6ta behov hos partner- och medlemsorganisationer samt st\u00e4rka sin f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att anpassa sig till nya globala f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar.  \n- \u00f6kad lokal n\u00e4rvaro i samarbetsl\u00e4nderna; antalet anst\u00e4llda vid lokalkontoren \u00f6kar f\u00f6r ge ett mer kvalitativt, och kostnadseffektivt st\u00f6d till  partner- och medlemsorganisationer tex ska fler lokala kontor \u00e4n idag ha en controller. \n- \u00f6kat finansiellt st\u00f6d till partnerorganisationer. \n- f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrad resultathantering; fr\u00e5n traditionell redovisning med f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda resultat och indikatorer till adaptiv management, d\u00e4r indikatorer ska v\u00e4gleda uppf\u00f6ljningen av verksamheten. Metoden kr\u00e4ver mer personella resurser men v\u00e4ntas ocks\u00e5 inh\u00e4mta ov\u00e4ntade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och resultat. \n- omst\u00e4llning av st\u00f6d till partnerorganisationer; fr\u00e5n finansiering av projekt inom partnerorganisationer till finansiering av hela organisationer, vilket leder till ett mer bist\u00e5ndseffektivt st\u00f6d. \n\nSida bed\u00f6mer att dessa f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar kommer att st\u00e4rka verksamheten och de f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntade resultaten, och v\u00e4lkomnar d\u00e4rf\u00f6r de presenterade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna. \n\nANDRA SIDA-ST\u00d6D\nOPC f\u00e5r st\u00f6d f\u00f6r sin verksamhet fr\u00e5n olika avdelningar p\u00e5 Sida. Sedan flera \u00e5r tillbaka har Sida uppmuntrat OPC att s\u00f6ka medel fr\u00e5n andra finansi\u00e4rer. OPC:s beroende av sidafinansiering \u00e4r fortsatt mycket stor. F\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande motsvarar det 84% av OPC:s totala inkomst f\u00f6r 2019.

Dessa var: j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, milj\u00f6 och klimat samt konflikt. Uppf\u00f6ljningarna genomf\u00f6rdes av sidar\u00e5dgivare och Sidas help desks. \n\nOPC:s ans\u00f6kan har beretts av en beredningsgrupp i en samberedning. F\u00f6ljande r\u00e5dgivare och/eller funktioner har ing\u00e5tt i gruppen: handl\u00e4ggare med ansvar f\u00f6r st\u00f6d till OPC, controller, resultatstyrning, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, handl\u00e4ggare med fokus p\u00e5 bist\u00e5ndseffektivitet och jurist. Beredningsgruppen har haft regelbundna avst\u00e4mningar i syfte att belysa OPC:s verksamhet och organisation utifr\u00e5n olika infallsvinklar och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra bed\u00f6mningen i sin helhet. Under beredningsprocessen har Sida haft flera m\u00f6ten med OPC, b\u00e5de i grupp och bilaterala mellan r\u00e5dgivare. Synpunkter har efterfr\u00e5gats fr\u00e5n relevanta svenska utlandsmyndigheter samt andra enheter p\u00e5 Sida som hanterar avtal med OPC.",

        "description": "Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) \u00e4r ett program-baserat partnerskap som inkluderar de minst utvecklade l\u00e4nder (MUL), givare och internationella organisationer. M\u00e5let \u00e4r att st\u00f6dja MUL att vara mer aktiva akt\u00f6rer inom det globala handelssystemet genom att hj\u00e4lpa dem att minska deras hinder inom handelssektorn. P\u00e5 detta s\u00e4tt arbetar EIF programmet mot ett \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5l f\u00f6r att fr\u00e4mja ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt och h\u00e5llbar utveckling. I dagsl\u00e4get best\u00e5r EIF av 23 givare, 6 multilaterala organisationer (IMF, ITC, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World Bank), 2 observat\u00f6rer (UNIDO och UNWTO) och 51 l\u00e4nder (48 MUL och 3 l\u00e4nder som nyligen l\u00e4mnade MUL kategorin). \n\nSida har gett st\u00f6d till EIF sedan 2009. St\u00f6det har uppg\u00e5tt till 120 MSEK f\u00f6r implementering av EIF fas 1 som p\u00e5g\u00e5r fram tills 2017. Den f\u00f6reslagna insatsen inneb\u00e4r att st\u00f6dja EIF:s implementering av fas 2 med 100 MSEK under \u00e5ren 2017-2021. Hela tidsperioden av EIF fas 2 omfattar \u00e5ren 2016-2022 och insatsens totala indikativa budget ligger p\u00e5 274-320 MUSD.\n\nEIF:s syfte \u00e4r of\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat i fas 2 och syftar till att st\u00f6dja MUL att: (1) integrera handel i nationella utvecklingsstrategier, (2) uppr\u00e4tta de strukturer som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att samordna leveransen av handelsrelaterat tekniskt bist\u00e5nd, och (3) bygga upp handelskapacitet, vilket \u00e4ven omfattar att ta itu med kritiska begr\u00e4nsningar p\u00e5 utbudssidan. \n\nFokus inom EIF \u00e4r kapacitetsuppbyggnad inom handelsfr\u00e5gor av MUL och framtagande av behovsanalyser, s\u00e5 kallade Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS). D\u00e4refter tar man fram landspecifika \u00e5tg\u00e4rdsmatriser i syfte att kunna identifiera akt\u00f6rer och finansi\u00e4rer som kan genomf\u00f6ra insatserna. I vissa fall implementeras och finansieras prioriterade \u00e5tg\u00e4rder direkt inom ramen f\u00f6r EIF. Exempel p\u00e5 s\u00e5dana prioriterade \u00e5tg\u00e4rder fr\u00e5n fas 1 \u00e4r \"High Value Silk\" projektet som syftar till att \u00f6ka konkurrenskraften hos den kambodjanska silke sektorn f\u00f6r att skapa arbetstillf\u00e4llen s\u00e4rskilt f\u00f6r kvinnor, st\u00f6d f\u00f6r anslutning till WTO och kapacitetsuppbyggnad f\u00f6r handelsinstitutioner, regeringstj\u00e4nstem\u00e4n osv. Vidare syftar EIF programmet till att st\u00e4rka givarnas st\u00f6d till landets egen handelsagenda. MUL kan anv\u00e4nda EIF som en mekanism f\u00f6r att samordna givarst\u00f6det och tillf\u00f6r mer resurser inom deras handelsagenda, medan givarna kan ansluta sig till EIF som en mekanism f\u00f6r att leverera p\u00e5 deras \u00e5taganden inom handelsfr\u00e5gan. EIF:s aktiviteter finansieras genom en multi-donor trust fund.\n\nEIF:s globala f\u00f6rvaltningsstruktur best\u00e5r av EIF styrkommitt\u00e9n, EIF styrelsen, EIF sekretariatet och en fondf\u00f6rvaltare. EIF:s styrkommitt\u00e9 fungerar som ett \u00f6vergripande ledningsorgan, medan EIF:s styrelse \u00e4r det beslutande organet f\u00f6r EIF-programmet och ger strategisk tillsyn. Styrelsen best\u00e5r av en representant fr\u00e5n varje multilateral organisation (IMF, ITC, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World Bank), tre representanter fr\u00e5n de minst utvecklade l\u00e4nderna och tre representanter fr\u00e5n givargruppen. EIF:s sekretariat \u00e4r den genomf\u00f6randepartner/operativa f\u00f6rvaltaren av EIF-programmet och \u00e4r en del av WTO:s huvudkontor i Geneve, Schweiz. UNOPS regionala kontor i Geneve fungerar som fond/finansiell f\u00f6rvaltare f\u00f6r EIF fas 2 och \u00e4r Sidas avtalspartner. \n\nP\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 leder en nationell EIF fokalpunkt sj\u00e4lva EIF processen i landet, en EIF donor facilitator arbetar tillsammans med EIF fokalpunkten f\u00f6r att underl\u00e4tta givarsamordningen och EIF:s nationella styrkommitt\u00e9 \u00e4r ett forum f\u00f6r beslutsfattande och samordning mellan statliga parter inom handel, den privata sektorn, det civila samh\u00e4llet och givarna i det specifika landet.",

Most are involved in casual work and have limited time and interest to pursue regular education options. , the project will work with the government, communities and education providers to offer three tailored pathways for girls to access quality education over a period of 4 years: - An 11-month alternative basic education (ABE) course will enable young adolescents (girls and boys) who dropped out or have never been to school to reach a Grade 4 level, become fluent readers and fully numerate, and acquire basic life skills (financial literacy, leadership skills, communication and negotiation).",

These institutions face a huge challenge in their efforts to plan and effectively implement a comprehensive course of action at federal and state levels. This seriously hinders the country\u2019s ability to effectively plan and appropriately position for addressing the underlying root causes of water insecurity, environmental degradation, the recurrent disasters as well as the emerging threats due to climate change impacts.The intervention envisages to provide strategic directions and priority actions considering the evolving institutional context and emerging issues to promote resilience and adaptaive capacity.",

The programme is a follow-up phase of the \"IMS-Fojo Somalia Programme 2014-2018\" which amounted to a total figure of 57 MSEK.\n\nIn order to avoid an activity gap between the first and second phase, IMS/Fojo decided to start implementing the programme from 1st of January 2019 with temporary funding from IMS headquarter.

        "description": "Somalia is one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with nearly 7 out of 10 people living in poverty. The poorest are widespread particularly among populations living in e.g. rural areas and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements. The humanitarian crisis in Somalia has for decades been one of the most complex and protracted emergencies in the world with climate-induced hazards (recurrent droughts and flashfloods), locust plagues and ongoing conflict. The country continues to be fragile with a population which frequently faces the predicament of too frequent shocks that do not allow ample time for recovery from local coping mechanisms.  \n\nClimatic changes which are likely to increase in both frequency and severity strongly impact on-going conflict dynamics, which in turn, significantly affect the livelihood of already vulnerable communities, especially through the effects on migration, forced displacement and loss of income generating resources/assets. The absence of livelihood options and the increase in poverty contribute to grievances, conflicts and susceptibility to shocks. The accumulation of household debt is a key vulnerability for those Somalis whose livelihoods are negatively impacted by repeated extreme patterns of climate shocks and intermittent conflict. Grievances that are linked to group affiliation are particularly serious risk factors as they affect conflicts on multiple severity levels.\n\nThe main objective of this contribution is to construct and contribute to the establishing a NEOC which will be the national hub for all emergency management planning and response, and the host the Federal Government (FG) level strategic response during a disaster situation in coordination and collaboration of the Federal Member States.",

        "description": "NRC is Norway\u2019s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida's Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC's capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida's humanitarian unit's annual budget appropriation which is substantial.\nThe objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: \"To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.\" It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.\nNRC\u2019s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.\u00a0Sida's Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC's method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).\nMore specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.\nAs an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:\u00a026% for Shelter and settlements,\u00a020% for\u00a0 Education,\u00a017% for Livelihoods and Food Security,\u00a014% for ICLA,\u00a09% for WASH,\u00a03% for Camp Management and\u00a011% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.\nThe good scores of NRC in ITAD's evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.\nDescribing NRC's activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC's work.\u00a0\nSHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC's expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in\u00a0protracted displacement situations.\nLIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life\u00a0and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten\u00a0livelihoods and individuals' and households' abilities to earn a living.\nICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one's rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC's lawyers.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to people to claim\u00a0and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative\u00a0dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity\u00a0documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge\u00a0around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face\u00a0particular obstacles in accessing their rights.\nEDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education\u00a0with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education\u00a0interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.\nCAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp\u00a0management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and\u00a0protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation\u00a0mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback\u00a0mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.\nWASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of infrastructre for\u00a0water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.\nSida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida's funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.\u00a0\nRRM Allocation 2021\nIncluded in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC's capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida's funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.\nMethod- and capacity-building projects\nIncluded in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp; advocacy forums at the national level.\n- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it\u00a0focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the \u2018Safe Programming\u2019 framework defining minimum commitments for NRC's operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in 'refugee-like' situations.\n- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to\u00a0ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC's ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.\n- Sida's support to NRC's CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.\n-\u00a0NRC\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida's humanitarian unit and Sida's unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at\u00a0generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida's Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.\n- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.\u00a0NRC's active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida's support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC's commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.\n- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida's humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.",

Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one's rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC's lawyers.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to people to claim\u00a0and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative\u00a0dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity\u00a0documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge\u00a0around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face\u00a0particular obstacles in accessing their rights.\nEDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education\u00a0with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education\u00a0interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.\nCAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp\u00a0management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and\u00a0protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation\u00a0mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback\u00a0mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.\nWASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of infrastructre for\u00a0water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.\nSida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida's funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.\u00a0\nRRM Allocation 2021\nIncluded in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC's capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida's funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.\nMethod- and capacity-building projects\nIncluded in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp; advocacy forums at the national level.\n- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it\u00a0focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the \u2018Safe Programming\u2019 framework defining minimum commitments for NRC's operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in 'refugee-like' situations.\n- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to\u00a0ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC's ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.\n- Sida's support to NRC's CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.\n-\u00a0NRC\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida's humanitarian unit and Sida's unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at\u00a0generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida's Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.\n- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.\u00a0NRC's active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida's support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC's commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.\n- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida's humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.",

        "description": "FAO\u2019s Global Goals are:\n1. Eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, progressively ensuring a world in which people at all times have sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life;\n2. Elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods;\n3. Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.\nBased on the global goals, FAO has formulated five strategic objectives:\n1. Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition\n2. Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable\n3. Reduce rural poverty\n4. Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems\n5. Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises\nThe Strategic Framework also includes a sixth, broad objective on technical quality, knowledge and services (including cross-cutting themes) that is designed to cover FAO\u2019s internal capability to deliver its strategic objectives. The objectives are in alignment with FAO\u2019s commitment to working in partnerships.\nIn humanitarian crises, FAO\u2019s main components are:\nTo help people to anticipate and prepare for crises; To respond fast to crises; To seek to reduce risks and address vulnerabilities.\nThe humanitarian operations are usually related to the 5th strategic objective which has the four following organizational outcomes (OO):\nOO1 - countries and regions have legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition;\nOO2 - countries and regions deliver regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food, and nutrition;\nOO3 - countries apply prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks for agriculture, food and nutrition;\nOO4 - countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition are prepared for, and manage effective responses.\nAt the next level in the FAO Strategic Framework, there are a number of outputs pertinent to humanitarian action, such as:\nOutput 4.1: Humanitarian action effectively protect lives and livelihoods of farmers, herders, Fishers, forest- and tree-dependent communities and marginal groups in times of crises.\nOutput 3.1: Strategies and related interventions improve the resilience of livelihoods systems at risk through prevention and mitigation efforts that minimize the potential impacts of disasters and crises on agriculture food and nutrition at national, subnational and community levels.\nOutput 2.2: Improved capacities of countries and communities to identify monitor and evaluate risks; conduct needs assessment and response analysis; and act on impending threats to agriculture, nutrition, food security and food safety (and related public health issues).\nOutput 3.3: Conflict-sensitive programmes on agriculture, food and nutrition reduce the risks of localized conflicts relating to access to grazing, forest and farming lands, fishing grounds, water, trees and other natural resources.\nAs Sida support FAO\u2019s operations through a variety of different projects in different contexts, this appraisal does not include an overarching results framework. In the annual follow up reading up to Sida\u2019s conclusion on performance all individual project reports will be analysed and assessed.",

        "description": "According to the project application the objective of the intervention is to promote high-level political dialogue processes as a means of contributing to improved peace and stability in Somalia. More specifically, to improve the political relationship between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and the Federal Member States (FMS); build the capacity of MoIFAR and FMS line Ministries in the implementation of the National Reconciliation Framework (NRF); and help resolve inter and intra-Federal Members States relations through dialogue. The Somalia National Reconciliation Framework/Plan will be used as a guiding document to holds all these elements together.\nThe project aims to continue building on and consolidating achievements made through Sweden\u2019s support to HD-facilitated work in Somalia to date. The project is based on three distinct but related dialogue streams or sub-objectives:\nPromote high-level dialogue between the FGS and FMS through the MoIFAR-led National Reconciliation Framework (NRF) implementation process that helps resolve political tensions between them and paves the way for consensus building on key issues including federalism, constitutional review, forthcoming election and security amongst other state building concerns. Facilitate capacity building and provision of technical advice by both local and international expertise to MoIFAR and FMS line ministries in the implementation of the NRF that informs and shapes the process while improving working relations between the FGS and FMS. Support dialogue processes for the FMS that helps them resolve inter and intra-state disputes that affects them helping in the building of more harmonious and mutually beneficial relationships.\nThese political dialogue processes in combination provide important building blocks for increased political stability in Somalia. The political developments in Somalia since the inception of the FGS have highlighted the importance of consultation and ownership by Somali leadership in order for the solutions to be sustained, achieve the necessary impact and stability on the ground. This project seeks to advance the objectives with the following activities:\nPromote high-level dialogue between the Federal Government of Somalia and the Federal Member States by: Continuing to work with senior representatives of MoIFAR at Federal and FMS levels as well as key advisors on reconciliation in the President/Prime Minister\u2019s office in reaching out to key high-level representatives to engage in the dialogue between the FGS and FMS; Working with MOIFAR using the NRF as an entry point in partnership with FBA and UN REFS to create an FGS-FMS inter-ministerial forum that will ultimately become the operational/implementation arm of the NRF process; Undertaking shuttle dialogue between key actors to develop strategies for getting buy-in and ownership of the top leadership at both the FGS and FMS level on the federal structure and other state building matters; Facilitating and convening dialogue between the FGS and FMS leadership in order to resolve conflict issues between them such as constitutional review, elections, federalism, security and agree on mechanisms to address any new arising matters; Providing technical advice and expertise in the dialogue processes as well as capacity building support for key stakeholders in thematic areas on economic, political and social issues such as resource and power-sharing, reconciliation and conflict resolution amongst others;\nExpected outcomes of objective 1:\nExpected outcomes of the 2021-2023 project: - Increased confidence amongst the parties\u2019, evidenced by their willingness and enthusiasm to participate in FGS-FMS dialogue;\n- Correspondence of action by FGS-FMS in relation to implementation of the Somalia National Reconciliation Framework and other national issues;   - Build consensus among the international community which supports this initiative on how best to support the FGS-FMS relationship building;\u00a0\n- Dialogue begins to improve the relationship between the FGS and FMS and helps to manage tensions on emerging issues;\u00a0\n- A forum is established that allows the FGS and FMS discuss and reach agreements on critical and long-standing critical issues that will determine the relationship between both the FGS and the FMS, going forward\nFacilitate capacity building and provision of technical advice by both local and international expertise to MoIFAR and FMS line ministries in the implementation of the National Reconciliation Framework by:\u00a0 Further consolidate the relationships established and effectively implement the resolutions reached in the course of the March 2020 HD-organized Study Tour to Rwanda to move forward the NRF implementation process;

While District Councils are mandated to provide services to citizens, there is still an unclear delineation of roles and responsibilities, as most sectors are (in practice) not yet decentralised from the line ministries and in many cases delivery been taken over by NGOs. Furthermore, there is a palpable mismatch between the responsibilities allocated to districts and the (financial and human) resources they have.\n\nThe Association of Local Government Authorities of Somaliland (ALGASL) was established in 2006 by the mayors of 10 district councils. ALGASL aims to build strong local governments and support decentralisation, benefiting local communities, including marginalized groups such as women, youth and IDPs. At present, ALGASL has 10 paying members out of the 23 districts with elected district councils. Though ALGASL has potential, the association is constrained by a lack of human and financial resources, which hinders its ability to fulfill its mandate and attract additional members.\n\nIf strengthened, ALGASL can play a pivotal role in working towards more legitimate local governments, because of its mandate to lobby and advocate for the interests of districts and to build their capacity. It is a highly relevant linchpin between central and local government, can provide nationwide outreach and can promote exchange of experience among districts through its platform function.",

Households and communities must recover, adapt and diversify their livelihoods and asset base in order to cope effectively during both harsh dry seasons and disaster episodes. SomReP\u2019s approach acknowledges the need to recover from shock quickly and its programming seeks to promote the local absorptive and adaptive capacity of households and communities. While promoting drought recovery, the program also builds institutional capacity, strengthens the natural resource management that underpins resilience livelihood, and prevents loss of livelihood assets through proactive early action.\"",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

        "description": "The project builds on the previous TB intervention implemented by LSV. However in order to increase effectiveness totally new strategies will be applied.TB continues to be an essential health problem in Somalia. The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rathe\nr new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the privat\ne sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration \nwith the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and \nparticipation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB cult\nure services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to \nTB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO\n called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The \nproject will help the poorest of the poor. For example many cases are found among people who suffer from malnutrition.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

        "description": "Somalia is recovering from decades of war and collapse of state structures. The core state functions are now operating and state formation is underway. The legitimacy of the state however is still weak. Conflicts and violence remain a significant challenge\n. The biggest threat is still Al Shabaab but violent conflicts between clans and militias as well as organized crime are also common. The weak security situation hampers development efforts and attempts to address the difficult humanitarian situation.Finn \nChurch Aid (FCA) and the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers have been active in mediation and local-level democratisation and institution building in Somalia for several years. In 2017 an expert was seconded to the Ministry for Interior Fede\nral Affairs and Reconciliation (MoIFAR) at the request of the Somali government. The expert has held a key position in the team in charge of drafting the strategy for reconciliation. During the years 2018-2019 the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland ha\ns supported national and local-level reconciliation processes through FCA and the Network. The first phase of the project saw the development of a nation-wide National Reconciliation Framework based on consultations with state and civil society actors. In \nFebruary 2019 the draft was validated at a national conference in Mogadishu. Altogether 300 representatives from the federal government federal member states and civil society took part in the conference. The National Reconciliation Framework was approved \nby the Cabinet in in March 2019. It has become one of the key priorities of the Somali government and especially MoIFAR.The second phase of the project supports MoIFAR in the implementation of the national reconciliation process while advancing the partici\npation of women and youth in the process. The project also includes support to local-level reconciliation. Finland supports the second phase of the project with 461 384 euros. The project will be implemented over a period of 12 months in 2019-2020.",

        "title": "Fighting TB in Somalia: public-private partnerships and inclusive communities",
        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

The impact is most pronounced in Ethiopia, which experienced its worst drought in 50 years, leaving 10 million people in need of emergency food assistance. In the Americas, Haiti is one of the most affected countries, with a third consecutive year of drought, exacerbated by El Ni\u00f1o, leaving more than 3.6 million people food insecure. Similar impacts are being felt around the globe. To date, twenty three countries have appealed for help to meet critical needs, including food, agricultural support, and water and sanitation.  With GAC's support, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is promoting early recovery and resilience building in some of the countries worst hit by El Ni\u00f1o, including Ethiopia, Haiti, Malawi, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Although specific programming differs based on the context in each country, FAO is protecting the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable groups, such as subsistence farmers and pastoralists, with agricultural inputs and livestock support.",

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proj\nect's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinic?s personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

        "description": "The Daryeel Mobile Health Clinic ?project aims at providing preventive and basic health care services to rural areas outside of Afmadow town in Jubaland Somalia. The project is executed by the Finland-Somalia Association (FSA) with partner NGO SAHDA and th\ne Jubaland Ministry of Health. The project is a continuation of the Maternal and Child Health Services Clinic ?project that the FSA has ran since 2011 in Afmadow town. Based on an agreement with the Jubaland Ministry of Health the FSA has been asked to swi\ntch its foces to more remote villages through a mobile clinic. The mobile clinic is to start its operations in 2018 depending on permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland. With this application the project plan is to continue the Mobile He\nalth Clinic through 2019-2020 a total of three years.The main development problem that the project aims to solve is the poor access to preventive and basic health care in the Afmadow area in Jubaland Somalia. The project aims to take health services close \nto remote communities where it is difficult to get access to basic healthcare and where travelling is a challenge. By curing and providing basic health services in remote locations the project contrib-utes to creating a healthier community and society with\n people who are able to work for their own livelihoods. In this context the project contributes significantly to achieving the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals. The development impact that the project strives for is to increase the wellbeing of the commu\nnities in the project area and to decrease the number of diseases and illnesses.The mobile clinic concept includes three core outputs:1. Supporting existing healthcare by providing health services in suburbs nearby villages and towns2. Providing supportive\n services in first aid family reproductive services and interventions reducing infectious diseases in the target villages3. Reducing travelling for health services from the towns as well as building the competence of the local community in health particula\nrly by giving tools and knowledge to local midwives.",

The core state functions are now recovering but the legitimacy and capacity of the state are still weak. Conflicts and violence remain a significant challenge. The prolonged confli\nct has resulted in porous air sea and land-border management providing a thriving conduit for Transnational organized immigration crimes. In order to improve security and strengthen state legitimacy the Federal Government of Somalia is aiming at strengthen\ning the capacity of the Immigration and Naturalisation Directorate IND in line with the National Development Plan. The project will focus on developing the institutional capacity of IND especially its HR Department in order to strengthen the legitimacy of \nthe Federal Government of Somalia in the field of immigration and border management. The project will utilize diaspora and international experts in developing capacity and strengthen IND?s infrastructural capabilities to deliver quality public services.   \nThe project will be implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) during a period of 14 months in 2020 - 2021.

It addresses knowledge gaps and generates evidence to help people cope with crises and meet their basic needs in the Horn of Africa, Sahel, and the Middle East. There are many drivers of crisis and poverty in this region. They include climate change, which has increasing impact on fragile, natural resource-based livelihoods. The target group for this programme are poor men and women, primarily in pastoralist areas of the Sahel and East Africa, who can benefit from improved agricultural support. SPARC\u2019s work is intended to inform FCDO\u2019s and other development agencies\u2019 programmes to strengthen the resilience of agricultural and pastoralist livelihoods, in the context of climate change. SPARC will: 1) Undertake new research that builds the evidence base where there are clear gaps on how to effectively deliver programmes and adapt policies. 2) Develop and support innovation, including through the use of technology, in FCDO and partner programmes, and in response to emerging agendas. 3) Targeted technical support to  country offices and programmes in the design, delivery and evaluation of existing programmes. 4) Develop and share lessons by curating knowledge, convening debates and undertaking broader communications and engagement initiatives to inform both the development of future policies and programmes, and technical support, ensuring that the research remains operationally relevant. 5) Research uptake and dissemination: to ensure that new analysis and tailored research is highly accessible to policy- and decision-makers, so that they can benefit from the programme\u2019s innovation and learning and apply it to their work. The programme will engage closely with FCDO country offices to ensure that FCDO country programmes and policies build on the evidence generated from the research.

Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt.",

The main focus is to rehabilitate productive infrastructre like roads, drainage and lightening. Through improved productive infrastructure in and to communities of IDPs, returning refugees and host communities, the project contributes to improvement of local living conditions. The labor intensive implementation provides short-term employment for IDPs, returning refugees and locals and helps to increase the economic status. The project contributes to stabilization of the fragile security situation in the region and therefore fulfills the second pillar \"Peace, Security and Stabilization\" of the \"Marshallplan with Africa\" by the german BMZ.",

Das Projekt zielt darauf ab, einen Beitrag zur Verbesserung der Lebensbedingungen der Bev\u00f6lkerung und dort angesiedelter Binnenfl\u00fcchtlinge sowie zur\u00fcckkehrender Fl\u00fcchtlinge zu leisten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort. Das stimmt mit den Forderungen im Marshallplan mit Afrika \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" \u00fcberein. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo, Baidoa und Garowe wurden Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt.",

Das Konzept der integrierten Gewerbeschule zeichnet sich zum einen durch einen an klaren Qualit\u00e4ts- und Pr\u00fcfungskriterien ausgerichteten, praxisorientierten Unterricht aus. Zum anderen bieten die Gewerbeschulen verschiedene Dienstleistungen im Bereich Weiterbildung und Unternehmensf\u00f6rderung f\u00fcr die lokale Wirtschaft an. Das Vorhaben unterst\u00fctzt die Gewerbeschulzentren dabei, ein breites Dienstleistungsangebot zu entwickeln, dadurch Einnahmen zu generieren und sich mit einem nachhaltigen Finanzierungsmechanismus langfristig selbst unterhalten zu k\u00f6nnen.

        "title": "Dhulka Nabaada (Land Of Peace): Land Reform In Somalia",
        "description": "After decades of insecurity and political instability, Somalia currently stands at a critical juncture for stabilization, peacebuilding and development. The prolonged conflict, in conjunction with the slow rise of political and state legitimacy, leaves the country with almost no functioning institutions and or rule of law. In 2012, the reestablishment of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), marked progress towards more permanent governance structure.Despite the considerable progress made in the last few years, the country still faces many challenges regarding political stability, peace and economic progress. One of those key challenges relates to land issues and how to address them in a systemic way in order to contribute to overall peacebuilding efforts.Land becomes intertwined with conflicts in various ways, primarily when dispossession takes place, or when rights to ownership, land use, access and transferability are consistently and arbitrarily violated. Any disruptive or forcefully imposed change on how groups and individuals connect to their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia has - resulted in various forms of organized violence and community disruption. Clan dynamics have also been a contributing factor to land conflict when there has been competition for the control of resources . With little to no effective state control of land or its administration, management and governance; armed groups and individuals can illegally acquire land, dispossess people, and forcibly evict the most vulnerable without due process. Those with access to social, economic and political power, coupled with the ability to use violence, have been able to illegally gain titles or control over land. The insecurity of tenure is also a significant barrier to the integration and economic development of displaced persons and communities. With the constant threat of forced evictions, displaced and vulnerable groups do not invest in the land, which impacts their ability to seek a livelihood.Political and socio-economic elites, and terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab, and the public at large including displaced populations are all current actors when it comes to land issues in Somalia. The State, due to political stagnation, insecurity and lack of institutional capacity has not been able to assert control over land management and governance or produce adequate land policies and legislation. An important role for the State will be to reclaim all public property and develop a cohesive land system that can produce policy or regulatory frameworks that govern land and land use in accordance with the rule of law. Elite groups with access to militia and financial resources are another actor whose unregulated actions disproportionately impact land markets and fuel land disputes and conflicts.Al-Shabaab remains a significant threat to the state and communities in many parts of the country and in most of the regions proposed for this programme. Different sources also assert that because of lack of trust in the formal justice system which is perceived as corrupt and clan based, people will prefer to go to Al-Shabaab courts to ensure protection of their land rights rather than to the formal court system. The public, including both host communities and displaced persons, is also another actor and the end-users this programme seeks to reach. Most often, the weakest and most vulnerable groups, they often face legal uncertainty, lack of protection and consistence violations to their housing, land and property rights.Another contributing factor to the land conflict dynamic in Somalia, which has only become more pronounced in recent years is migration and displacement. Due to years of conflict and natural disasters, millions of Somalis have been displaced and dispossessed of their land. Recent trends of returning refugees from neighboring countries and those who have been in a state of protracted displacement has resulted in large communities of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vulnerable groups living in informal settlements with little to no access to tenure security. Because of the current trends, it is predicted that this dynamic will continue, and programs must account for the reality that not only will rapid urbanization rates require urban resilience measures, but also promoting social cohesion is vital to peacebuilding initiatives. Protective measures for vulnerable groups through safeguarding basic human rights and enhancing security of tenure is not only important for land tenure purposes, but it also facilitates reintegration and economic development that can help stabilize and develop the region.Land disputes and conflict have disproportionate impacts on different groups within society. Women and youth are amongst the most disenfranchised when it comes to equal access to land use and ownership. With little formal recognition of rights to land and a male dominated customary land adjudication process, the rights of women are often periphery in land discussions. Ownership of land for Somali women is often linked to male relatives for greater protection. Such a reliance however limits their agency and poses a significant disadvantage to women-headed households. This programme will work towards enhancing women\u2019s access to justice as end-users and encouraging their participation in land governance and adjudication systems.Youth make up much of the Somali population, approximately 81.5% of the population is under the age of 35 . Despite the high number, this does not translate into proportionate political or social representation. They face numerous systemic barriers and require targeted advocacy to ensure that their rights are enforced. This project will benefit from, and work collaboratively with the PBF-funded Youth Political Empowerment project currently being implemented in Jubbaland and South West State. This program will aim to incorporate and integrate youth and their experiences, it will encourage their participation and ensure protection mechanisms are in place for them. Other vulnerable groups, including clan minorities are also marginalized when it comes to land access and rights. Using a human right centered approach to land management and supporting governments to standardize and promote land rights is key to a fair and equitable land reform process. By encouraging the participation of women and youth in land dispute resolution mechanisms we can begin to appropriately reflect the diversity of the communities in judicial and quasi-judicial processes.This project intersects on each of the five strategic priority areas from the UN Strategic Framework, and will directly support the realization of three of them:1. Supporting institutions to improve Peace, Security, Justice, the Rule of Law and Safety of Somalis 2. Strengthening accountability and supporting institutions that protect3. Strengthening resilience of Somali institutions, society and population8By enabling governments to address land conflicts in a meaningful way, this project will establish land dispute resolution mechanisms to enhance access to justice, improve security and contribute to overall peace and adherence to rule of law. To ensure full national ownership this project hopes to create enabling dynamics that allow national, state and local governments to take the lead and institutionalize these efforts. This project will not only contribute to the UN\u2019s strategic priorities, but also supports and aligns with several of the pillars of the Somali National Development Plan9 and the priority areas for each region. By working to improve land governance at local and national levels, this project contributes to enhancing Rule of Law, building effective and efficient institutions, supporting economic growth and safeguarding gender and human rights. Supporting customary and formal legal mechanisms that can address land disputes will work towards re-establishing the rule of law. A focus on land governance and management will also help build effective and efficient institutions that are better able to serve the public needs.The project is aiming at capacitating approximately 500 direct beneficiaries (local authorities and community members) to information management system to register land, as well as approximately a total of 200,000 indirect beneficiaries (50,000 per target location) benefiting from improved justice mechanism and land information management systems.",

        "description": "The proposed project studies war induced rapid urbanization processes in Somalia from the viewpoint of the most vulnerable in-migrants, people who were internally displaced (IDPs) in the cause of the on-going war. It investigates security perceptions and practices of IDPs in four cities of Somalia (including Puntland) and Somaliland and thereby focus on the capacities that vulnerable populations develop to cope with the effects of violence and displacement and to mitigate their vulnerability. Grounded in the everyday (Lefebvre, 1971 2016, De Certeau, 1984; Felski, 1999) and bridging urban and security studies, the project foregrounds people's own understandings of security, which risks and threats they identify, however narrow or broadly defined, and how these risks impede on their daily life (Crawford   Hutchinson 2015). In particular, the research asks: What does security mean and on which security arrangements do urban IDPs rely in the everyday? How do social, political, economic and environmental factors shape dynamics of everyday security? What continuities and change characterize security arrangements and everyday security in the course of migration to the city? With photo-voice, the project additionally proposes a methodology that gives 'voice' to people who are usually overheard or silenced, without however relying solely on their verbal capacities.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve the living conditions and\nlivelihood opportunities of displaced communities in Hargeisa through the\nprovision of durable shelter with secure land tenure, settlement\ninfrastructure, basic services, and skills training.A long-term, unresolved issue for the politically stabilized and\nsteadily growing city of Hargeisa\nis the large number of IDP families residing on former government land and in\npublic buildings. The local government has been trying to address this problem\nby identifying land for resettlement, but lacks the financial and technical\ncapacity to address the pressing housing situation and to find lasting\nsolutions. UN-HABITAT, with previous funding from the Government of Japan, has\nassisted the municipality by providing low-cost housing, improved services, skills\ntraining and livelihood opportunities to returnees and IDPs at the Ayaha-II\nsettlement area, on the southern fringe of Hargeisa.\n\nThe interventions carried out under this project respond to the\ncontinuous need to improve living standards and provide durable solutions for\nreintegration and resettlement of displaced communities in Hargeisa. In\nparticular, the project aims to reduce tensions between IDPs and host\ncommunities and incorporates issues of protection, and spatial and\nsocio-economic integration through permanent resettlement and improvement of\nlivelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable groups (women and youth).\n\nIn particular, the proposed project will target the resettlement and\nprovision of durable shelter for 350 returnee   IDP families in Hargeisa\noriginating from congested urban IDP settlements like the \u201cState House Area\u201d, a\nlarge piece of former government land in the central part of the city, which is\noccupied by an estimated number of 3,000 people. The location of the project activities\nwill be the new AYAHA-III settlement site (neighbouring the Ayaha-II area,\nwhich was the target of previous UN-HABITAT shelter activities). The site was\nformally approved for permanent re-settlement of IDPs by the Municipality already\nin 2010 and the re-settlement process has already begun in late 2011. The\nbeneficiary selection for permanent shelter under this project will undergo a\nlocally driven process to assure a fair selection.",

        "title": "Hargeisa Urban Water Supply Upgrading Project (Huwsup)",
        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve access to safe and affordable water and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable households in urban and peri-urban areas of Hargeisa city, through expanded supply of drinking water from sustainable water sources, and associated creation of employment opportunities.\nThe project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). \nThe specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: \ni. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; \nii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and \niii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.\nThe overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. \nAs requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. \nWhile the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:\nii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield\niii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. \niv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)\n\n\n\n\n[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project \u201cRehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System\u201d (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)",

        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve access to safe and affordable water and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable households in urban and peri-urban areas of Hargeisa city, through expanded supply of drinking water from sustainable water sources, and associated creation of employment opportunities.\nThe project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). \nThe specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: \ni. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; \nii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and \niii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.\nThe overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. \nAs requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. \nWhile the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:\nii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield\niii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. \niv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)\n\n\n\n\n[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project \u201cRehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System\u201d (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)",

        "title": "Federal Government Of Somalia And United Nations Joint Programme On Youth Employment",
        "description": "Skills development needs to be part of a comprehensive, integrated\nstrategy for inclusive growth. There needs to be greater private sector\ninvolvement and skills interventions with a sectoral focus. Skills development\nmust be tailored to the needs and aspirations of the young Somalis as well as\nthe needs of the private sector. It needs to fit within the overarching goal of\ndeveloping and maintaining a growth trajectory and competitiveness of various\nsectors of the economy that necessitates a skilled workforce that is aligned to\nindustry requirements. A comprehensive\nyouth skills package will be provided for youth from different\nsocio-economic backgrounds and according to the skills needs of the selected\nvalue chains that will have been analysed. We will utilize existing vocational training\ncentres to deliver competency-based training programmes which respond to the\nneeds of Somali employers, as identified during the value chain study.\nBeneficiaries will be provided with certification upon the completion of the\ntraining.Identifying current and anticipating future\nskills needs is the first building block of relevant training and skills\nstrategies. Several methods are\nused to forecast future skills needs. These include: forecasting occupational\nand skills profiles; labour market information systems and employment services;\nengagement with the private sector; and assessments of the performance of\ntraining institutions and the employment outcomes of their trainees.There exist opportunities for more specific technical and vocational training and\nentrepreneurship training at various stages of value chains, particularly\nin input supply and production to promote the inclusion of youth. Lack of\nskills in particular crafts is one of the biggest problems which can be tackled\nthrough the provision of well-designed training courses to increase the\nproductivity of youth. Similarly, opportunities for business start-ups and\ngrowth of existing businesses can be facilitated through a comprehensive\nmanagement/training programme aimed at starting and improving businesses and\nproviding business development services (BDS).It should be noted that youth aspirations are different from what is\noffered in some sectors, in particular the farming sector. Regardless of the economic opportunities available in the farming\nsector, young Somali men and women are being utilized as labourers within\nfamily farms which youth are not interested in.Key to the project strategy will be making the agriculture sector\nattractive for youth who are not necessarily looking to be involved in farming. This will be achieved through the involvement of youth in the\nlivestock, input provision and processing stage of the value chains which will\nbe selected. This is because youth will be involved in agriculture when it\noffers real business opportunities. Farming will also be attractive for youth\nif it is technology driven. Enhancing timely access to market information and\ncommunication, production techniques, new technology and financing\nopportunities will modernise the farming sector and will take full advantage of\na generation of young Somalis who are more technologically inclined, more\neducated and more willing to taking higher entrepreneurial risks than their\nelders.It is important that skill development initiatives do not only focus\non hard, job-related skills, but also on \u201csoft skills\u201d that are deemed more and\nmore important by employers and are needed for the personal growth of youth. The \u2018Youth for Change' initiative of UNDP, UNICEF, and ILO has shown\nthat through psycho-social rehabilitation and skills development, youth can be\ndiscouraged from joining criminal and violent groups, can recuperate, and can\ngive something back to their families and communities. This is a process of\nempowerment that can lead to children going to school and youths taking up\nvocational training. It shows how such engagement with youth can promote social\ncohesion and peace. \u201cSoft skills\u201d like leadership, personal financial planning,\ncommunication and information technology will encourage development of positive\nattitudes needed for employment. Other useful life-skills include health\ninformation, civic engagement, protection of rights and political inclusion.\nPsycho-social counselling and support services are necessary for youth who have\nbeen victims of violence and need re-integration into society and will be\nmainstreamed within the life-skills package. Building on a Construction Sector Analysis conducted under the SECIL project, a one-stop youth centre will be\nestablished in Mogadishu focusing specifically on construction skills\ndevelopment and building material production combined with life skills\ntraining. In order to specifically target young women, the one stop youth\ncentre in Mogadishu will also provide hospitality training.The three satellite centres will\nbe linked to vocational training centres rehabilitated by ILO and will be\nlocated in other urban areas than Mogadishu and will provide life skills\ntraining only. The main One stop youth centre\nin Mogadishu and the three satellite centres; this centre will utilize an integrated approach to youth\ndevelopment by providing both young men and women with safe spaces in urban\nsettings where they can undergo specialized vocational training(in the case of\nMogadishu), meet and access information and resources critical to creating\nlivelihoods. The Centre will also offer young men and women a choice of various\narts, culture, recreation, and health services. Separate programmes and space\nfor young men and young women will be developed where needed. This component will\nbe expanded based on the needs identified by the city and the youth of\nMogadishu.Capacity of Benadir Regional\nAdministration (BRA) to implement youth projects and mainstream youth aspects\ninto local government projects and programmes, in particular the one stop\ncentre, will be strengthened through the establishment and training of a youth\nunit and a youth advisory board at BRA. The Role of the youth unit and youth\nadvisory board will be established by BRA and FGS but may include mainstreaming\nyouth issues at the local level, policy development (for local government),\norganisation of youth events, job fairs etc. Both, youth unit and youth\nadvisory board, will be a model for other urban areas to be replicated and\nscaled up in the second phase of the programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of capacity development, relevant government ministries and institutions will acquire\ninstitutional and technical capacity development on methods of collection,\nanalysis and storage of labour market and skills data. Their national statistics\ncentre (Minister of Planning and International Cooperation) along with the Ministry\nstatistical units, will be strengthened with technical assistance from a\ntechnical expert who will be seconded to the line ministries. This assistance\nwill improve labour market information analysis processes and institutional\ncapacity at the national and regional level. The development of a full-fledged labour\nmarket information system will take many years; however, the proposed programme\nwill begin to train ministries and institutions for better collection and\nanalysis of data relevant to developing appropriate skills training programmes\nfor youth employment. Furthermore, tools, equipment and operational support\nwill be provided to vocational training institutions and the one-stop youth\ncentre. Identifying, selecting and training teachers in the development of competency-based\ncurricula, and in the delivery and assessment of these training courses, will\nbe core activities for capacity development of technical vocational training\ninstitutions. Furthermore, training managers will be provided with mentoring\nsupport to ensure the sustainability of vocational training centres.",

        "title": "Development And Pilot Implementation Of An Environmental Management System (Ems) At Un Support Office In Somalia (Unsos)",
        "description": "UNSOS is committed to reduce the environmental footprint of the mission\nin its host country, Somalia. It wants to improve the environmental performance\nof the mission by introducing sustainable design and operation (as much as the\nsituation in Somalia permits). This means addressing solid waste, wastewater,\nuse of energy and resource management as whole. UNSOS wants to achieve this by\nintroducing a systematic Environmental Management System (EMS) to each sector\nof the mission, which can be approved by an international organization of\nstandards (ISO) in the long-term. \n\n\n\nCurrently, UNSOS has a mission specific Environmental Policy (pending\napproval) that was drafted in reference to DPKO/DFS\nEnvironmental Policy for UN Field Missions, established in June 2009. The\npolicy defines environmental standards and objectives for UN field missions as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\u201cEach United\nNations field mission will take actions to integrate environmental measures\ninto its planning and operations in order to avoid and minimize the impact of\nactivities carried out by the mission and its staff on the environment and to\nprotect human health from such environmental impact. ?Such measures will be undertaken throughout all phases of a United\nNations field mission, including: Initial planning of the mission; setting up of logistic arrangements for the mission; maintenance and\noperations of the mission; closing of the mission.\u201d ?\n\n\n\nAn environmental policy (by itself) does not bring about a change in\npractices. Only the EMS is a guarantee that the Environmental Policy is\nactually implemented and that applicable standards are consistently met by the\norganisation during its operation. Only through the operationalization of a\npolicy will it be possible to minimise the environmental footprint of sector\nhubs and associated operations. Hence, the EMS means the operationalization of the environmental policy in place\nand to achieve set objectives and targets.\n\nThe Secretary General (SG) in his letter to the president of the Security Council dated 7 October\n2015 (S/2015/762 on the review of AMISOM and UNSOA) underlined that: \n\n\n\n\u201cThe impact on the environment of the United\nNations-supported activities in Somalia also remains a concern. The review\nnoted the absence of an environmental baseline study, dedicated environmental\nmanagement capacities and an African Union environmental policy to guide AMISOM\noperations, particularly with regard to wastewater management.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe strengthening of UNSOA and its conversion into UNSOS also includes\nthe development of capacities for adequate environmental management. \n\n\n\nThe Board of Auditors in its 2015 review of the operation of UNSOA formulated the following\nrecommendations: \n\n\n\nUNSOS is to develop a plan for undertaking and updating periodically\nenvironmental baseline studies of all Mission's locations in order to comply\nwith DPKO/DFS Policy on Environment for UN Field Missions.\n\nUNSOS is (a) develop a guideline of maintaining records of waste produce\nin the Mission; and (b) develop a database of waste produced in the Mission and\nupdate it accordingly. \n\nUNSOS is to develop effective mechanism such as action plan and effective\nmonitoring system for ensuring the Mission comply with the environmental policy\nrequirements.\n\n\n\nThe subsequent Security Council\nResolution (S/2015/840) stated the following:\n\n\n\n\u201cFurther requests the Secretary-General to consider the environmental impact\nof the UN fulfilling its mandated tasks, including carrying out an\nenvironmental baseline study and regular environmental impact assessments of\nthe operations of UNSOM and UNSOS.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll of the above mentioned elements point towards the fact that missions\nneed to take practical measures to obtain tangible results in order to meet the\nguidelines set forth in the DPKO/DFS Policy.",

        "description": "The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote\nimprovements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace\nconsolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall\nobjective to be realised, a number of agents\nwill have to\npromote change that\ncan alter the\nstatus quo in\na direction that\nfosters a stronger, more\nresponsive and accountable\ncompact between the\nstate and its\ncitizens in the\nprovision of service delivery.\nDespite progress the\ncurrent context is\nstill characterised by\nlimited trust in\ngovernment structures at both central and local levels, which in turn\nmeans that their legitimacy is often contested.\nThis can increase the\nrisk of a\nreturn to instability\nand conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where\nradical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus\na need\nto consolidate and\nenlarge the space\nfor non-state actors\nin the rest\nof Somalia and\nto restore a healthy and accountable state citizen\nnexus. \n\n\n\nTo achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the\nprogramme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing\nstrategies: \n\n\n\n1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for\nfunctional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance\nthe role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a\nmeans to improve local service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 1 will focus on policy\nand legal frameworks across Somalia\nand is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on\ndecentralization in Somaliland and\nPuntland. These provide an incomplete\naccount of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local\ngovernment, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for\nimplementation. These issues need to be\nclarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and\ndistricts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; \n\n\n\n2. Improving local government capacity for\nequitable service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 2 aims to address the\nweak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a\ncomprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements\nof local administration. It also seeks\nto improve coordination between\ndistricts and the\ncentre in planning\nand programming to ensure\nbetter consistency and use\nof resources. A third output is concerned with increasing\nlocally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;\nand, \n\n\n\n1.\nImproving\nand expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,\nresponsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nOutcome 3 focuses on improving\nthe delivery of local services. This is\nto be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line\ndepartments, engaging more\ndirectly with non-state\nproviders, and enhancing\nthe accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another\nelement relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private\ninvestment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. \n\n\n\nIn all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the\nparamount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment\nand leadership. Without these ingredients,\nthe prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek\nsupport and political commitment at the highest\nlevels of Government,\nand sustain commitments\nalready established in\nPhase I with\nthe Vice Presidents of Somaliland and Puntland nominated as Champions\nfor Local Governance.",

        "title": "Support The Efforts Of The Un-Habitat Global Programme On Public Space",
        "description": "UN-Habitat\nhas worked with the issue of public space for 15 years or more. However, at the\n23rd Governing Council of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States\nasked UN-Habitat to place a larger focus on public space and how it can\ncontribute to sustainable urban development (Resolution 23/4 on Sustainable\nUrban Development through Access to Public Spaces). Specifically, UN-Habitat is\nmandated:\n\nTo advance the agenda on place-making and\n     public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and international\n     approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\n     UN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces\n     and the quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange,\n     cooperation and research between partners working in this fieldTo develop a policy approach on the role\n     that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of our rapidly urbanizing\n     world, to disseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a\n     plan for ensuring its application internationally;To assist in coordinating UN-Habitat partners in\ndisseminating knowledge to existing sustainable urban development processes at\nall government levels.Globally,\nthe growing attention to\npublic space informed the 23rd Session of the Governing Council of\nThe United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in 2011, where\nmember states mandated UN-Habitat to consolidate agency-wide work on public\nspace, to develop and promote public space policy, coordination, disseminate\nknowledge and directly assist cities in public space initiatives.[1]\n\n\nAgainst this\nbackdrop, UN-Habitat established in 2012, a Global Programme on Public Space\nnow working in 30 cities. The world secretariat of the United Cities and Local\nGovernments (UCLG) has created a Strategic Planning Committee chaired by the\ncities of Porto Alegre and Durban with a strategic focus on global advocacy,\nestablishing regional networks of cities working on public space, supporting\nlearning exchanges, tool development and documenting good practices in\npartnership with UN-Habitat. The Italian Institute of Urbanism (INU) has been\ninstrumental in developing the Charter on Public Space as well as hosting the\npublic space biennale.\n\nAnother great\nmilestone which has been achieved is the adoption of the 2016-2030 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals which adopted a Goal 11 \u2018Build cities and human settlements\ninclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\u2019 One of the proposed targets set\nout is \u201cby 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible,\ngreen and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and\npersons with disabilities\u201d.\n\nThe adoption of\nthe SDG 11.7 by the General Assembly in September 2015, constituted the most\nsignificant attention ever to public space in the global policy arena. However, continued support for SDG 11,\nand in particular public space Target 11.7, will be even more important to\nensure adequate means of implementation and a sound monitoring framework that\nwill be necessary to catalyse action on public space as a contribution to\nsustainable cities and human settlements. This will require that cities invest\nin public space and in the spirit of the new urban agenda cities and local\ngovernments should take an integrated, trans-disciplinary approach by working\nin partnership with a range of stakeholders and organizations, including civil\nsociety, academia and the private sector to ensure inclusive, safe and\naccessible public spaces for all.\n\nIn 2013-15, the Future of\nPlaces (FoP) initiative significantly contributed to raising awareness around\nthe public space agenda on a global level. The FoP is a multi-stakeholder\ninitiative which was established by Ax:son Johnson Foundation, UN-Habitat and\nProject for Public Spaces (PPS) bringing together a large and diverse network\nof stakeholders around the issues of public space through a series of annual\nconferences (2013 in Stockholm, 2014 in Buenos Aires and 2015 in Stockholm\nagain). The Future of Places gathered leading global thinkers, academia,\ndecision-makers, practitioners, other UN Agencies, media, communities and\nprivate sector that subscribe to the transformative power that good quality\npublic spaces can have in a city. All together the network represents about\n1,500 individuals from 700 organisations, from 275 cities, across 100 countries. The success of this initiative has shown the\ncommitment of a wide range of actors with a stake in public space, as well as\nhighlighted the global importance of this theme. In a short time it has created\na global movement for public space (10.000 followers on twitter) contributing\nactively to highlighting its benefits and putting it on the global development\nagenda.UN-Habitat has worked in\nthe area of public space for over 15 years. However, at the 23rd Governing\nCouncil of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States asked UN-Habitat to\nplace a larger focus on public space and how it can contribute to sustainable\nurban development. Specifically, UN-Habitat is mandated: \n\n\n\na) To advance the agenda on\nplace-making and public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and\ninternational approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\nUN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces and\nthe quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange, cooperation\nand research between partners working in this field; \n\n\n\nb) To develop a policy\napproach on the role that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of\nour rapidly urbanizing world, to\ndisseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a plan for\nensuring its application internationally;\n\nc) To assist in coordinating\nUN-Habitat partners in disseminating knowledge to existing sustainable\nurban development processes at all\ngovernment levels.\n\nThe project is\nalso aligned with the UN-Habitat Strategic Plan 2014-2019 and specifically to Sub-programme\n2: urban planning and design and expected\naccomplishment 2: integrated and\nparticipatory urban plans and public space for compact, inclusive and\nconnected cities.\n\nFor example, the project links with the\nfollowing UN-Habitat interventions:\n\n\u00b7\nUrban\nBasic Services: Sustainable Urban Transport in East African Cities (SUSTRAN)\nProgramme\n\n\u00b7\nParticipatory\nSlum Upgrading Programme (PSUP) \n\n\u00b7\nMunicipal\nSpatial Support Programme (MuSPP)\n\n\u00b7\nThe\nSafer Cities Programme\n\nUN\nHabitat is also a knowledge leader in the public space arena, developing tools\nand guidelines as well as contributing to global thinking through the Habitat\nIII issue papers, policy units, amongst others. Moreover, UN-Habitat has commenced several partnerships on the global\nbut also on the regional level focusing on issues related to public space. Therefore, UN-Habitat is perfectly\nplaced to take advantage of the opportunities presented by SDG11.7 on public\nspace and continue working on public space for the next four years.",

        "title": "Youth Political Empowerment: Enabling Somali Young Women And Men To Meaningfully Engage In Governance, Peacebuilding And Reconciliation Efforts",
        "description": "In light of the context and gap\nanalysis, the proposed intervention seeks the support of the UN Peacebuilding\nFund to increase the inclusion of young men and women in state and\npeacebuilding processes in Somalia. More specifically, since Somalia is in the process\nof reestablishing legitimate State institutions and systems of governance at\nthe Federal Member State and District level, this intervention seeks to\ncapitalize on this in order to ensure these structures are including young men\nand women and take their priorities into account. With the passing of the Local\nGovernment Laws in South West and Jubbaland States in July 2017, both states\nhave launched their respective District Council formation processes. It is\nvital that these governance bodies have youth representation and address the\nneeds of young Somali men and women for these new institutions to be\nrepresentative and perceived as legitimate by their constituents. While other\ndonor funds are supporting stabilization and peacebuilding efforts at the community\nlevel, as well as the development of local government institutions and systems,\nthere is currently no intervention specifically promoting the inclusion of\nyoung men in women in state and peacebuilding processes in South West State and\nJubbaland. An investment of the Peacebuilding Fund to support such an\ninitiative is anticipated to have a dual catalytic effect by changing the\nattidudes of decision makers and their constituences in Kismayo, Baidoa and\nDollow in favor of youth inclusion and by improving the representativity of\ndistrict and state level governance structures. This expected outcome will have\na substantial impact of intergenerational relations, enabling young men and\nwomen to become key agents of change in the peace and statebuilding processes\nof Jubbaland and South West States. This proposal directly supports the\noutcomes of the current Peacebuilding Priority Plan for Somalia (2016-19) which\naims to strengthen the demand for and offer of good governance \u2013 rebuilding the\nsocial contract between Somali citizens and the Somali State. The proposed\nintervention therefore also directly contributes to the implementation of the\nFederal Government of Somalia\u2019s Wadajir Framework for Local Governance and to\nits Stabilization Strategy. The Youth\nPolitical Empowerment Programme\naims to provide young people and youth-led organisations, particularly young\nwomen\u2019s organisations, in Baidoa, Dollow and Kismayo with the tools and\nopportunities to meaningfully engage in decision-making, including the\nconstitutional review process as well as state-building and reconciliation\nefforts at the district level. The programme supports\nthe implementation of UNSC Resolution\n2250 (2015), which recognises the important and positive contribution of\nyouth to the promotion and maintenance of peace and security. The proposed\nintervention will enable marginalized youth in Somalia to engage in\nstate and peacebuilding efforts at the local and federal levels. This directly\nsupports the implementation of the UN Youth Strategy Principles which has\nidentified the political participation, empowerment, leadership,\nprotection of youth human rights, inter-generational collaboration as\npriorities. The programme also supports the ongoing efforts\nto develop a National Youth Policy for Somalia. The proposed intervention is\nalso aligned with the Federal Government of Somalia\u2019s National Development Plan\nwhich mainstreams youth as a cross-cutting issue throughout the nations\npriorities in order to contribute towards stability, economic prosperity and\nnational cohesion. The difficult security and\npolitical context in Somlia, calls for innovative ways to reach-out, engage,\nand mobilize youth.Therefore, the programme will facilitate the use of\ninnovative communication platforms including social media (Facebook, Twitter,\netc), radio podcasts, and web TV, to reach out to youth creating a channel for\nyoung women and men to express their visions for the future of Somalia. By\namplifying young people\u2019s voices, the programme will promote the exchange of ideas\namong peers and communities at large, challenging negative perceptions and\nfostering an intergenerational dialogue and trust. In view of the specific\nneeds of young women identified above, the programme will adopt a gender\nresponsive approach, mainstreaming gender issues in all activities and ensuring\nequal access to benefits for both women and men of the different age groups.\nThe programme will particularly ensure the participation of young women, as\nthey traditionally suffer double discrimination (age and gender). Based on a\nrealistic assessment of the Somali context and the challenges faced by Somali\nwomen, all capacity building workshops and councils will aim to have at least\n40% young women beneficiaries. After assessing the needs of young women\u2019s organizations,\nthe programme decided to employ a gender mixed approach to the different\ninitiatives, bringing young women and men together, enabling a collaborative\napproach, while sensitizing young men in the process.The programme will also provide\ntraining and strengthen the institutional capacity of the local administrations\nin Baidoa, Dollow and Kismayo to respond to the needs of young women and men.\nBy employing an area based approach to improve coordination amongst all levels\nof government. The programme provides a catalytic\nopportunity to build on recent peace and state-building gains and builds on\nrecommendations from the Security Council Resolution 2250 on youth, peace and\nsecurity and the National Youth Conference held in 2015, which identified the\nneed for dialogue platforms at the local and regional levels.The programme proposal was\ndeveloped in close consultation with Y-Peer Network, and other local youth\norganisations in the target areas. Prior to implementation, further\nmobilization of young women and youth organizations will take place. In August\n2017, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports employed their national radio\nprogramme \u201cAsk Your Friend\u201d to hold consultations with young women and men.\nOver 450 young people engaged through radio call-ins and emails. The findings\nfrom the radio survey highlighted that 55% of respondents emphasized there is a\ndire need for youth to meaningfully engage in peacebuilding. They also raised\nthe need for more efforts to minimize or respond to clan disputes, tackle\nillegal migration and prevent violent extremism. Moreover, 30% of the\nrespondents, underscored that youth-led community action should be prioritized\nwhile 15% of the respondents underscored the need for increased youth\nparticipation in political and governance decision-making processes.",

        "description": "UNDP and UN-Habitat are cooperating in the UN Joint Programme for Youth Employment, which \u2013 since its inception in October 2015 - has provided training and work opportunities to over 6,000 young women and men. This Action will build upon the successful model created, greatly contributing to and enhancing realistic livelihood opportunities for youth, with a strengthened focus on IDPs and returnees. This Action will significantly build on this work in the following ways:\u2022\tProviding youth in the targeted IDP communities with mentorship and entrepreneurship training;\u2022\tProviding safe spaces for IDP youth to learn and acquire the necessary skills to access the labour market for sectors that are immediately remunerative;\u2022\tEnabling IDPs to become more competitive in the lucrative sectors of the labour market.UNHCR has established a capacity building curriculum under the Protection Cluster focusing on protection and durable solutions for displaced populations, international humanitarian law, housing, land and property rights protection, including protection against forced evictions, as well as humanitarian negotiations. This Action will utilise the capacity building curriculum in the following ways:\u2022\tProviding eviction guidelines to authorities and law enforcement sectors explaining lawful evictions processes and their implementation;\u2022\tTraining of authorities on the protection of IDPs, durable solutions and protection of housing, land and property rights for IDPs and other vulnerable groups, notably against force evictions;\u2022\tConduct advocacy campaigns on IDP specific protection and durable solution-related challenges in the Mogadishu context.UNDP and UN-Habitat have been working on the Joint Programme for Local Governance (JPLG) since 2008. The Programme has facilitated strong, dynamic and organic links with government and non-state actors. UNDP and UN-Habitat\u2019s efforts in strengthening local governance will be replicated in this Action by:\u2022\tProviding capacity building training to the municipality which aims to create knowledge surrounding standards and systems necessary to support social protection programmes such as rental subsidy, low-cost housing, and relocation of IDPs;\u2022\tFormulating by-laws at the local municipal level.Potential Synergies(Please refer to the potential synergy table on the attached prodoc.)In September 2015, the Somalia Protection Cluster supported by UN-Habitat and UNHCR held the first ever Housing, Land and Property forum in Mogadishu bringing together Federal authorities, the municipality, UN and NGOs as well as donors to deliberate on more sustainable approaches to address forced evictions and support urban durable solutions. The outcomes of this forum and the relevant follow up processes also inform this proposal. Future Housing, Land and Property fora will further be used to support this Action.In December 2015, the DSRSG/RC/HC for Somalia launched the Somalia IDP Solutions Initiative advocated for by the Somalia Protection Cluster and supported by the three agencies participating in this joint action. This initiative was borne out of the need to urgently address the deteriorating situation of the IDPs and find durable solutions to protracted displacements. The Initiative seeks \u201cto complement still needed humanitarian assistance with development interventions to reverse the trend of protracted displacement and substantially reduce the number of IDPs in such displacement by facilitating and supporting durable solutions that bring them back into mainstream life and address underlying causes of their displacement and its protractedness.\u201d This initiative is led by the Federal Government of Somalia represented by H.E. Mohamed Arteh, Deputy Prime Minister, and the DSRSG/RC/HC. This action will actively and directly contribute towards the IDP Solutions Initiative",

If urbanization is the engine that propels the world towards prosperity in the 21st century then youth are the engineers. There are more people under the age of 25 today than ever, totaling over three billion or almost half of the total global population; 1.8 billion of that total are between the age of 12 and 24. These youth live, by and large, in cities and towns; the cities of the developing world account for over 90% of the world\u2019s urban growth and youth account for a large percentage of those inhabitants.

Yet, land becomes a conflict driver when forms of dispossession take\nplace, or when rights to land use, access and transferability are violated. Any\ndisruptive or forcefully imposed change in how groups and individuals connect\nwith their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia did -\nresult in forms of organised violence. Conflict, natural disasters or rapid\nsocial and economic transformations (e.g. state formation, industrialization\nand urbanisation) trigger migrations that separate populations from their\nbelongings, assets, livelihoods and the cultural landmarks they identify with.\nHaving in place fair mechanisms to protect formal and customary rights to\naccess, use and transferability of land and regulate land use and allocation is\nessential to prevent outbreaks of conflict and violence.\n\n\n\nRegarding movements\nand dispossessions produced by conflict and natural disasters, in Somalia the\nnumber of internally displaced has almost tripled over the past ten years. The\nurban dimension of internal displacement is evident and corroborated by the\ntrends in rural to urban migration which has, over the past ten years, averaged\nrates of 4.1-4.5%. The relevance of cities in strengthening security,\nresponding to large population influxes and consolidating peace dividends is\nunquestionable. Yet, city expansion in major urban centres in Somalia is\nlargely unplanned and unregulated and land is arbitrarily redistributed.\nIncreased commercial interests have triggered large-scale investments, as well\nas construction works for commercial and residential structures. However, the\ntrickle-down effect of this renewed commercial interest is extremely limited.\nVulnerable populations hardly ever are in the position to harness the benefits\nof this rapid transformation. Displaced persons, returnees urban dwellers and\nurban poor are caught in a negative feedback loop, whereby the lack of\nregulation, good governance and law enforcement, exacerbates insecure access to\nland, exposure to violent land disputes and forcible eviction, as well as\nexclusion from public service delivery. This vulnerability and marginalization\ncontributes to pervasive fragility and conflict, In sum, nascent formal\ninstitutions are unequipped to equitably re-establish tenure units, and\ncustomary rights are often arbitrary and not accessible to \u201cidentity-defined\u201d\nstrangers - this would be the case of returnees and migrants who cannot access,\ncontrol and transfer land customary rights on the same grounds as local\ncommunities.\n\n\n\nThe recent\nannouncement by the government of Kenya expressing intention to repatriate\nSomali refugees has raised the already prominent issue to a critical level in\nsome areas. In the absence of a well-established legislative framework and law\nenforcement procedures for land, context appropriate, consensus based, and\nequitable solutions to land remain key establishing foundations for sustainable\nrecovery and stability. Conversely, the failure to address land issues,\nsecurity of tenure and sustainable housing could result in instability,\nconflict and the destitution of affected groups. \n\n\n\nThe multidimensional\naspect of community driven responses to instability and conflict mitigation\nrelated to mobility and housing, land and property as well as urban planning\nrequires a multi-agency approach, through which each agency will capitalize on\nits own experience and expertise. The International Organization for Migration\n(IOM) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) have the\nexpertise and mandates to support these locally owned processes in addressing\nmobility/displacement and space/urban planning. IOM, as the leading agency on\nmobility and migration, will utilize its experience in supporting community\ndriven approaches to respond to drivers of displacement and mitigate disputes\nrelated to mobility and movements, while UN-HABITAT, as the leading agency for\nurban planning and addressing issues related to space, including land, will\nemploy its expertise in supporting locally driven approaches to promote\nparticipatory urban planning, participatory settlement upgrading, resolve land disputes and map conflicts and\ndispute resolution mechanisms related to housing, land and property.\n\n\n\nGiven the scale of\nSomalia\u2019s population movements summarized above, geographic targeting through a\nfirst phase of support needs to be carefully considered and the following\ncriteria are used to prioritize targeting for this project. Firstly, areas\nimpacted by the return of Somalis from Dadaab refugee camp are prioritized for\nthis intervention. Whilst the number of IDPs by far exceeds the number of those\nreturning from Dadaab, the former are living in protracted situations of\ndisplacement and the latter will return over a short space of time. This\njustification is therefore based on the time critical impact that returns will\nhave in existing fragile contexts and the accompanying need to provide support\nat social, infrastructural and legislative levels. The second criterion is to\ntarget those areas highly impacted by internal displacement particularly those\nnot currently covered by existing interventions. When combined with the first\ntargeting, of areas being impacted by return, the following areas become an\nobvious priority. \n\n\n\n\n \n  \n  Location\n  \n  \n  Estimated IDP population\n  \n  \n  Estimated No. of returns based on intention\n  surveys[1]\n  \n  \n  Returnees from Dadaab to date\n  \n \n \n  \n  Kismayo\n  \n  \n  57,240[2] \n  \n  \n  39,723\n  \n  \n  4,873\n  \n \n \n  \n  Afmadow\n  \n  \n  54,984[3]\n  \n  \n  \n  2,085\n  \n  \n  1,347\n  \n \n \n  \n  Garbaharey\n  \n  \n  3,325\n  \n  \n  58\n  \n  \n  133\n  \n \n \n  \n  Baardheere\n  \n  \n  18,000\n  \n  \n  1,600\n  \n  \n  2,005\n  \n \n \n  \n  Bu\u2019ale\n  \n  \n  12,000\n  \n  \n  3,966\n  \n  \n  1,536\n  \n \n \n  \n  Sakow\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  2,181\n  \n  \n  2,004\n  \n \n \n  \n  Jamame\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  193\n  \n  \n  764\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nFor the funding from\nthe Human Security Trust Fund, the interventions will focus on Kismayo and\nAfmadow, while additional co-funding from other sources (Peacebuilding Fund,\netc.) will focus on other locations within Jubaland. Members of the joint\nprogramme currently have either an existing operational footprint or will\nexpand to these locations in the coming months which also supports the\nfeasibility of supporting interventions there.\nFurthermore, all of the above referenced locations have been identified as\npriority by the Federal Government Ministry of Interior and are therefore in\nline with government\u2019s current focus for the types of interventions proposed.",

Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden bereits Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt. Zur Finanzierung des Vorhabens stellt das BMZ insgesamt 23,24 Mio. EUR aus FZ-Altmitteln und einer neuen bilateralen Zusage bereit.

        "description": "A locust invasion in Somalia is threatening livelihoods as crops and vegetation for livestock foraging suffer extensive damage. According to the Somaliland National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) localized damage has been observed in Somaliland, where locusts have occupied a total of 100,000ha of Somaliland\u2019s coastal region including Woqooyi Galbeed. This has affected1,087,264 people, of which 22,853 are in IDPs camps. SC has observed the impact of the locust invasion to be most severe in Hargeisa Maroodijeh with 8,000ha of rangeland and 3,000ha of crop land damaged. In addition, Agabar and Arbasiyo villages in Gabiley districts have also been hard-hit with 1,000ha of damaged land. The Woqooyi Galbeed region was already characterized by significant food security gaps which is exacerbated by the desert locust crisis. According to the FSNAU technical release 153,000 people are food insecure (IPC 3 or 4) including 12,054 in Gabiley district and 139,134 in Hargeisa district. An SC survey showed that pastoralists are skipping meals or selling their remaining livestock for low prices to purchase food. There is also an increasing trend of labor migration at the critical time of Gu seasonal preparation. Only few actors respond to the locust crisis in this area including SOS and World Vision. Response gaps affirmed by the Food Security Cluster (FSC) monthly dashboard show 150,000 people need urgent Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to protect access to food security. These include IDPs and pastoralists who have lost their livestock and have less than 6 goats. In addition to the locust crisis, Somalia is also at risk of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Somalia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 16th March 2020 and currently has 60 recorded cases including 5 in Somaliland and 2 in Woqooyi Galbeed. Given the rapid pace of the virus and lack of access to testing kits, there are concerns that the number of cases will rise rapidly.",

To date, the country remains divided by various political and clan factions and strong anti-governement elements who are benefiting from the availability remnants or war (ERW) such as landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) thereby significantly weakening the overall stability and security in Somalia. This project seeks to reduce the impact of landmines, unsecured ammunition stockpiles, UXO and other ERW have at regional level. Phase one will target Northern Somalia (Somaliland) where large clearance efforts are coming to an end in the next three years and where, until clerarance is completed, accidents will continue to affect rural communities. HALO will deploy four manual clerance teams and one mechanical team to clear 616,000m2 from 1 Setember 2016 to 31 December 2018. Phase two will take place in Southern Somalia where government credibility has been gradualy increasing and where making concrete steps to restore stability can significantly foster state's legitimacy. International funding for HMA in Somalia is contributing to the multilateral effort to stabilise Southern Somalia by addressing factors leading Somali populations to migrate to Europe in search of better futures. HALO\u2019s work in Southern Somalia began in 2015, and a process of slow, steady development is being undertaken to minimize risks to the programme.",

Phase III of the programme started on 1st July 2018 and is envisaged to end on 30th June 2023. Federal governance structures in Somalia, all highlight a need for focusing on the third level of government (the district) as part of the federal consolidation and new state formation, without which genuine stability, encompassing most citizens, will not be realized. The Government of Somalia has identified the unique role local governments have in strengthening social contracts and contributing to service delivery and their role in building the legitimacy of the state and improving the resilience of communities to shocks, conflict and disasters. Establishing and capacitating local governments to promote good governance is included as national priorities in National Development Plan (and associated State Development Plans) as well as the Stabilization Strategy under the Comprehensive Approach to Security (CAS) and the Wadajir Framework for Local Governance. UN JPLG III is best placed to support the Government of Somalia to achieve local governance goals because of the implementation history of JPLG I and II and the long-term partnerships formed with local authorities. JPLG III will support the state to achieve context specific goals for local governance as well as contribute to strengthening the capacity of government to lead coordination at Federal, state/central and district levels. This would be achieved through  support to policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance; strengthening the capacity of local governments to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace and improve the engagement between citizen and local government, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups.",

Innovative participatory processes such as crowdsourcing, participatory video, and the use of PDRC\u2019s mobile audio-visual unit (MAVU) will allow the capturing ideas, filling the gap in regards to jobs and skills for rural and pastoral communities, analysis of the skills, needs and available markets in the selected regions, and dissemination of the importance of community dialogue and mental health skills for a sustainable and successful linkage between jobs and skills. The idea is not only to understand how these groups perceive jobs and skills in the respective regions but also to engage them in developing participatory solutions to tackle overlooked, negative or stereotyping aspects in the community.",

The secondary objective of this pilot is to get the best examples of impact-driven SMEs in our countries and understand what it takes for them to scale-up, both their business and impact. This will allow us to improve our programme further by including working with superstar impact SMEs into our approach.

This has proved successful in the last three years. The strategy engages young women and men from diverse backgrounds to be a driving force for social progress and optimism about the future in their respective countries and across Africa.\nWhen we worked with stakeholders in each country to analyse the current situation faced by young men and women, we found three common key needs:\n1. Improving curricula and training methods, creating new modules and connecting the curricula to the demands of the market.\n2. Innovation to respond to social issues such as climate change, gender rights and urbanization.\n3. Linking service delivery interventions with influencing interventions # young people do not need only better training and new skills, but also changes to the system: policies, laws, practices and the attitudes and beliefs of their fellow citizens, employers and the government.\nThese conclusions have guided this proposal in further developing interventions and adapting activities for each country for 2020-2022. We will highlight new interventions in the following chapters.\nOur strategy is based on systems thinking:trying to understand how different parts of a system interact to effect change, rather than understanding specific components in isolation. Systems thinking can help to develop truly sustainable and transformative change. The below graphic illustrates the#system# for youth seeking employment in Somaliland, mappingthe relationships of actors including education institutions, hubs, teachers, government, banks, entrepreneurs, families and media.",

Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

Oxfam#s assessment found pout that some of those structures are not used by people due to varying reasons. Oxfam EFSVL and WASH team discussed this issue and propose we combine water and agricultural production. Oxfam will support ministry of agriculture to assess 6-7 water points in those two regions aimed to start agricultural production. The government will mobilize communities and familiarizethem agricultural production. It is expected that linking existing water sites to agriculture will improve nutritional. Mionistry of agriculture will enhane agricultural practices by introducing agriculture around those water points. The ministry will provide seeds, knowledge regularly using its field staff.\nNutrition-Sensitive Agriculture is good-based approach to agricultural development that puts nutritionally rich foods, dietary diversity and food fortification at the heart of overcoming malnutrition and micronutrientdeficiencies. This assignment focuses on the utilization of water resource for agriculture sector to improve the nutritional value of foods for good nutrition, health and productivity, and social significance of farming and supporting rural livelihood specially that pregnant, lactating women and child.\n# The main objective of this mission is to investigate the suitability of borehole water resource for utilization for irrigation purpose.\n# Understanding Perception of the community for benefiting water for agriculture purpose\n# The MOAD consultants will observe the appropriateness of nature of land (soil type, topography, soil nutrient) for crop production and predict the method of irrigation that could be used.\n# During the field exercise, the consultants will analyze the proper ways of community water allocation for domestic use, animal watering and irrigation.\n# The consultants will investigate the current situation of agricultural production status and level of nutrition of beneficiaries# community.\n# Consultants will have soil and water samples",

Humanitarian response focuses on WaSH, EVFSL and Protection.\nOxfam has made a lot of gains through humanitarian resilience programmes which are likely to be eroded if the desert locust menace is uncontrolled. Oxfam will therefore capitalise and work with the existing community structures such as Early Warning Committees, Government line ministries, FAO and other stakeholders on the preventive and control measures.\nOxfam will prioritize safeguarding livelihoods focusing on cash intervention and locust control measures.\n\nA total of 1,056 people in coastal areas of Sool region will be reachedby the project and supported toprotect and recover their livelihoods.\n\nOxfam has vast experience in implementing conditional and unconditional cash transfer approaches in WASH, EVFSL programmes. The project will specifically focus on the Cash for Work(CfW) approach as it not only empowers individuals to spend based on their priority needs but also focuses on revamping community assets. CfW will therefore stimulate the recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroduce income flow,supporting local businesses through the purchase worktools while also encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally. The trench digging will involve large numbers of the population and will be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in an area thus benefitting the entire community and not just a few individuals.\n\nThe project will support communities to address locust spread by burying them in trenches excavated through cash for work. A total of 1,056 people will dig 26 km of trenches and drive hopper bands through cash for work, this task will continue for 30 days, 15 days per month starting in mid-March 2020. This task is expected to minimize hopper bands probability to turn to dangerous swarm level while at the same time communities will be able to access cash to help them address food insecurity situation at household level.\n\nOxfam will closely cooperate with the Somaliland Ministry of agriculture",

In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3)outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeastern Somalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.\nBesides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement.

        "description": "# Solarization of two existing water sources   in Baki and Saylac districts of Awdal benefiting more than 10,000 people and their livestock. Awdal is one of the regions affected by COVID19 as it connects Somaliland to Djibouti. The majority of people are dependent pity trades, small scale irrigation, and livestock, most of these activities have been affected, and communities reported a reduction of income. Existing water supply sources are mainly powered by a diesel generator that are purchased from the tariffs collected from the users. Associated water tariffs are sky rocking as access to diesel has reduced as restrictions are imposed on public transport. Out of the many strategic water sources, two sources are selected, supplying water for villages affected by COVID19 in Somaliland. Oxfam will install a solar system for these wells, and the action will reduce the cost of water tariff and increase community use of water for different purposes include handwashing.\n# Build the capacity of the WASH committees managing the solarizedse water sources by providing necessary tools and training them on both technical skill and financial management. This action will be led by the ministry of water department of scheme management. As we mobilize for the two sources an additional two boreholes within the sameareas will also be invited for the training. These will help to maximize use of expert time, cover nearby villages with capacity building plan and increase value for money by targeting more with same budget.\n# Support Somaliland Ministry of Water Development to ministry of water to finalize   the design and construction for WASH facilities to be shared with all WASH Cluster members in Somaliland. The national WASH cluster has prioritized this action as per the request from ministry and Oxfam will contribute for this action. The budget will be used to cover some of the consultancy fees or provide expertise to help them finalize the work.\n# Provide safeprogramming training for WaSH committees, district administrations, women groups other key stakeholders including traditional leaders    .\n# Protection awareness raising including community discussions on protection impact to address stigma and promotion of the call centre hotline   (already operational) to increase access to covid19 services for affected communities    .\n# Government capacity building/strengthen social safety net system in Somaliland : we will build the capacity of the government to be able to lead and coordinate Somaliland safety net program. Somalia launched safety net project called bahnano at Mogadishu but this has not been cascaded to Somaliland and Puntland. The government staff responsible for this are unable to run safety net due to their limited capacity. The project will target technical staff from the government and create enabling environment in the form of institutional capacity building including training of key staff, support implementation of beneficiaries selection and running coordination mechanisms smoothly.  Oxfam Somalia is implementing social safety net activity under GFFO top up. Under this activity the project aims improving supports to HHs in urban areas particularly COVID19 affected poorest or most vulnerable to prevent them to fall to poverty and destitution trap, manage COVID19 economic and social shocks and advance their lives <(>&<)> livelihoods. The government capacity in Somaliland on social safety net is to grow and as part of appeal fund, Oxfam will contribute to strengthening/establishing social protection system that leads COVID19 response project. Oxfam will partner with Somaliland Ministry of Employment, Social and Family as socialprotection responsible government body. Somaliland government capacity is yet to grow and this project will address this gap while also coordinating with other implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to be able to lead social assistance and provide at scale in the future to its society as a right. The project creates an opportunity for governments to become the standard responders to large scale crises.",

The partners areaiming to harness the innovations of young people in Somaliland and beyond particularly social entrepreneurs, developers, changemakers, and health practitioners keen on bringing game-changing solutions to most vital social challenges focusing on in the areas of agriculture, technology, SDGs, health, food, education, and energy. The partners believe that tackling these complex issues will require diverse skill sets, backgrounds, effort and innovation. Harhub will be prioritizing innovations which may already be proven but will reach new heights of interest within the industry given the right support from Harhub, or innovations which are new ideas and concepts, but might need some tuning to fit the requirements of potential customers.\nThrough a competitive process, Harhub will reachout to 10k youth through social media promotions to apply the program for three weeks. Harhub is expected to receive quite big and competitive projects. Whilst applicants are ongoing, Harhub will create mentors\u2019 criteria and hire 3 mentors to lead selection and the Bootcamp. All the submitted projects will be evaluated by the mentors based on the solutions\u2019 unique value proposition, social impact, visibility, technical viability, and the individuals\u2019/teams\u2019 ability and capability to scale the solution.\n\nIn total, the mentors will then select twenty most advanced and innovative projects to attendthe two full days Bootcamp to be held at Harhub. The Bootcamp will be a high-energy workshop focused on rapid ideation, refinement, and prototyping of solutions. It is a space to generate, iterate on, and test ideas for social impact, foster a culture ofinnovation through experimentation, collaboration, and expand a community of social impact innovators. In the final event, twenty finalists will pitch their solutions for a chance to win grant funding, incubation, and mentorship scheme. The top three projects will be awarded a grant fund to their projects at Harhub with all support of providing free incubation and mentorship to develop, validate, execute and scale their solutions",

According to Somaliland\u2019s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, UNDP and the World Bank reports, over 70% of Somaliland\u2019s population is under the age of 30. The unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 30 is 67% - one of the highest rates in the world. Among young women, it is even estimated at 74%. Youth in Somaliland are not just the future ofthe country, they are also the majority.\nWith 67% of the youth being out of work, the high unemployment rate forthe youth remains abig challenge in Somaliland, and this rate is even higher for young women. The unemployment rate for young women in the country is estimated to be 74%. Due to the insecurity over the last two decade and stagnant economic growth, jobs have not been created at a rate that is able to match the growth of the youth population.\nWomen often face stiff competition during business pitching/competitions and often shy away to compete with their fellow men or observe stigmatization. This conceptwill bridge this gap by specifically earmarking this Women in Tech competition for young women tech savvies to compete among each other.\nTo achieve a long lasting and sustainable economic and social transformation in the country, we must empower young women, create opportunities for prosperity and provide them with the necessary tools and resources.\nHence Innovate Ventures (IV) in partnership and collaboration with Oxfam aim to support, accelerate and grow the Somali women startup scene and accelerate the growth of women startups in technology to help them create employment opportunities, and improve the investment climate in the country",

Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises.

        "description": "6.3 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance across Somalia and Somaliland, with 2.6 million internally displaced and an estimated 1 million displaced in nearby countries. Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises. Although specifically tackled in the Somali context here \u2013 climate shocks and conflict are global causes of ongoing humanitarian crises, making the Nexus Platform\u2019s approach pertinent to challenges at the triple nexus in parallel circumstances. Comprised of nine local NGOs (footprint 30m USD), Oxfam andSave the Children International and entirely locally led, the platform is operational across every region of Somalia and Somaliland. The platform is built upon principles of South-to-South learning and civil society strengthening, whereby expertise is openly exchanged between member organizations to build a consortium that is more than the sum of its parts. Humanitarian response is central tothe platform\u2019s nascent phase. The platform envisions both multisectoral humanitarian response and the development of an Anticipatory Response Mechanism \u2013 utilisingthe platform\u2019s breadth of local access to trigger pre-emptive early action. The platform urgently needs \u2013 and is invested in developing \u2013 a model for its humanitarian programme areas through a PoC process which will allow the platform to rethink conventional humanitarian approaches that are particularly open to question in contexts such as Somalia. The process used to develop this model will be additionally adapted for the development of the platform\u2019s ways of working in the development and peace spheres:whilst humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, programs exemplifying locally-led decision making are planned in community development, government and civil society strengthening, women\u2019s empowerment and other areas across the triple nexus and these will require their own guiding PoC processes.",

This intervention forms approximately 70% of the total cash transfer programming under Oxfam\u2019s overall response and will be implemented directly by Oxfam by engaging electronic financial service provider in Puntland via mobile phones. Beneficiarieswho don\u2019t possess Sim-cards will receive them as part of this response and be trained on its usage. The overall Oxfam food securityintervention which this contributes towards will include additional emergency livelihoods and recovery elements including cash for work interventions to rebuild destroyed feeder roads.Oxfam targets households that meet the critical food insecurity criteria takingintoconsideration gender-differentiated needs. The selection criteria will be discussed with thetarget women, men, boys and girls toensure fairness of the selection process. Usually, women are registered as beneficiaries and the head of the household for cash transfers.

Female-headed households are the most affected as they do not have access to meaningful household assets such as livestock, or other sources of income. In Bari region, priorities for livelihood regeneration activities are different for women and men. Oxfam will deliver emergency food security interventions through cash grants for the most vulnerable people, while supporting household income by strengtheningand diversifying livelihoods through other projects. Oxfam's programming since March 2017 has successfully diversified the source of livelihoods in traditional pastoralist communities in Somaliland with plansto replicate this expereicnce in Puntland. This intervention will help vulnerable households to have some disposable income which they can use to purchase or meet their household food needs.Most vulnerable community members that will be most in need of the emergency assistance through this action will be identified through participatory mapping exercises conducted at village level through specific exercises including well-being rankings, vulnerability mapping, food consumption score, household purchasing power, among others. Gender will be consideredwhen selecting households to help reduce the additional burden on women headedhouseholds. The criteria shall be clearly explained to the selection committee/panel prior toselection, with clearcommunication on what beneficiaries will be entitled to during the project, to avoid unrealistic expectations.",

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly.

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

        "title": "CO-Drought & Sever Water Shortages Respo",
        "description": "2020 was one of the hardest years for Somalia in decades. Flooding, COVID-19 and recurring locust invasions heavily impacted on theeconomy and livelihoods of people. The government implemented measures to contain COVID-19, including the closure of schools, reduction of movement and other economic activities. The coastal areas of Puntland and Somaliland were also hit by cyclone Gati in November 2020, resulting in a sharp increase in humanitarian needs which many organizations - including Oxfam Somalia - responded to. While the performance of the 2020 Gu rain was near normal, the Deyr rain of 2020 has been categorized a complete failure due to the La Nina conditions. These developments triggered severe water shortages in many regions and districts in Somalia. Since October 2020, regional administrations, communities and other humanitarian agencies have been sending alerts about looming drought conditions in many parts of Somalia.Oxfam\u2019s feedback hotline continues to receive a high number of calls from people requesting immediate water interventions. These callers are mainly from the Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions. UNOCHA assessment findings indicate that over 50% of the communities in the assessed locations reported displacement of people due to water shortages, 85% raised major concerns on watershortages, and 14 out of 40 villages reported an increase in diarrheal cases. The price of water has already more than doubled. According to Oxfam\u2019s own market assessment, one barrel of water is currently being sold at an average of USD 4.5 per barrel, with some villages reporting over USD 7 per barrel. This is forcing the most vulnerable households to travel long distances to fetch water and/or opt for poor water quality and risk their lives. The most affected communities include IDPs and low-income host communities. Women and girls are at risk of protection-related risks as they travel in search of water.\nRegarding COVID-19, over 4,784 cases with over 130 fatalities were registered by the WHO in Somalia since the start of the pandemic, with many cases left undetected due to asymptomatic infections, low testing capacity and the stigmatisation of COVID-19 cases among the population. The second wave of the pandemic seems to have also hit the country as the number of cases started to increase in the last few months. The government of Somaliahas eased most of the restrictions in August 2020 and most of the public services have resumed. This increases the risk of vulnerability to COVID-19 and the shortages of water in many areas further restrict the communities' ability to frequently wash their hands with soap. This might create a favourable environment for COVID-19 to spread.\nThe Ministry of Water Development in Somaliland shareda request with all humanitarian agencies, indicating that over 196,848 people are in need of urgent water interventions and that many others also require quick rehabilitations of their water sources. Over 88% of the people in need are from the Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer regions of Eastern Somaliland. In October 2020, Oxfam using the ECHO crisis modifier budget reached the most vulnerable 1,800 HH (10,800 people) in Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer for 30 days with WASH interventions. Since then, we have continued to advocate for urgent interventions by sharing summary reports with the Somalia WASH cluster and presentations of the situation with cluster members. Utilising other existing resources, we are also working with the Ministry of Water Resources to rehabilitate boreholes that were identified as strategic wells by the government.",

        "description": "The first component is aimed at capacity building. At least 40 beneficiaries (at least 30% female) including fishermen and women, fishmongers will undergo a maximum of six months theoretical and practical training. Youth fishermen and women will be trained on safety at sea, fishing gear mending and repairs, safe fishing methods and fish preservation, cooperatives establishment and fish quality assurance. Fishmongers, who will mostly be women, will be trained in various topics including fish handling and preservation, fishprocessing, personal hygiene, value addition (processing, grading, and packaging) and small business management. Entrepreneurship will be an integral part of the courses in order to leverage the entrepreneurship capacity\nThe second component is aimed at supporting the establishment/ strengthening of fishery organizations. The target beneficiaries will be organized in Self Help Groups (SHGs). The SHG is a rights-based approach which views poverty as the denial of rights and poverty alleviation as a process of reclaiming one\u2019s rights. Given the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the SHG Approach puts equal emphasis on the goals of economic, social andpolitical empowerment . Therefore, the established/strengthened SHGs will have the potential to empower small-scale fishers againstsome of the environmental and socioeconomic shocks such as fish catch shortfalls and revenues, sickness and death in their families, natural disasters and hunger. The 30 young fishermen will be organized intoat least 5 SHGs and will be trained/ oriented on the operations of the SHGs\nThe third component will support the distribution of fishing kits/gear to the SHGs including women fishmongers.Midway through the training, the project beneficiaries will be provided with fishing gears in their SGHs. Such gear may include boats and other necessary tools. On the other hand, women fishmongers, will have business start-up kits including refrigerators and basic fish processing tools. The fishing kits/ gear will be owned and managed jointly in the SHGs.\nThe fourth component will focus on learning and knowledge management through value chain research. In order to ensure systematic market mapping in the fishing sector, understand actors, market share, capacity gaps, and other relevant value chain information, the project will undertake a robust research on fish value chain. The research will aim to bring out suitable models to link small holders to input and output markets and improve the benefits that fishermen and women and other resource-poor value chain actors derive from the chain. Knowledge generated from the research will be disseminated to different relevant stakeholders in the sector. It will also act as a building block for future scaling efforts of the project. As Oxfam and the partner have both long-term livelihood strategies, the research finding would beused for future programing.",

        "description": "Somalia, a fragile State that is emerging from decades of civil war, is currently experiencing an unprecedented situation mainly caused by climate change, Covid-19 and locust infestation, which exacerbated the long-term existed challenges within the country including widespread vulnerability and marginalization, insecurity and government with poor institutional capacity to deliver and advocate for basic humanitarian needs of local communities, combination of the above mentioned challenges contributed to negative socio-economic impact on Somali communities and resulted in the displacement of affected populations (mainly rural) and formation of IDP sites alongside main towns.\nOther challenges encountered by Somalia and Somaliland communities include lack of coping capacity to climate change and widespread dependency created by Humanitarian Aid due to the absence of government\u2019s role that affects the livelihood of entire communities rather than building their long-term resilience. It's evident that the Humanitarian Aid Dependency has largely affected the productivity of the Somali population. However, there's need to exhaust to what extent these will be addressed by our research questions for the Participatory Action Research (PAR) on Aid Humanitarian Aid dependency.\nIn 2019, nine Somali NGOs founded the Nexus platform that aims to shape the future in Somalia and Somaliland, by creating an enabling environment for Somali NGOs to have a leading role in the humanitarian system that puts the agency and self-reliance of communities at the center, through delivering a combination of Humanitarian Aid, Development, and Peace interventions. The Nexus coalition is led by nine Somali NGOs \u2013 African Development Solutions (ADESO), Centre for Peace and Democracy (CPD), Gargaar Relief and Development Organization (GREDO), Horn of Africa Voluntary Youth Committee (HAVOYOCO), KAALO, Save Somali Women and Children (SSWC), Social-Life and Agriculture Development Organisation (SADO), Taakulo Somaliland Community (TASCO), and WASDA. Two INGOs \u2013 Oxfam and Save the Children International were invited to join as international partners to support with critical investments.\nSo far the platform developed and applied its strategy andtheory of change whilst Humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, Somalia Nexus consortium aims to focus interventions that are in line with its pillars, including Community-driven and working across the Triple Nexusof Development, Humanitarian Aid, Peace-building and conflict-resolution, as well as strengthening the capacity of Somali Civil Society <(>&<)> Government institutions. In addition, special considerations will be given concerning practicality and implementation methodology including presence, scaleof the need, duration and coordination with other stakeholders.\nThe day-to-day activities of theplatform are performed by the Secretariat supported by the Steering committee who are also responsible for resource mobilization, organizing coordination meetings, fund management and drafting policies and guidelines\nIn 2021, the Nexus platform aims to implement efforts to support its members and government institutions in both Somalia and Somaliland, through development of Community-driven Development manuals, conducting Participatory Action Research that finds durable solutions on climate related challenges in both pastoral and agro-pastoral communities, conducting PAR that aims to address the level and scope of dependency created by Unconditional Cash disbursement to local rural communities as well as supporting Somalia and Somaliland governments to develop standardized Cash Transfer model with clear guidelines.\nSocial inclusion, protection and Covid-19 protocols will be maintained and mainstreamed in project interventions.",

        "description": "COVID19 disease has been identified in China and later declared as a global pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. In Somalia and Somaliland, the first case of the disease was reported in March 2020, and since then, the government authorities implemented measures including movement restrictions, banning all community gathering, closing schools and other religious facilities. Somalia has over three million internally displaced communities (OCHA, Somalia) and over 79% of Somalis are living either below or near the internationalpoverty line (NDP-9, Somalia). The majority of IDPs live in overcrowded settlements with weakened infrastructure, insufficient access to WASH facilities and inaccessible health services. Since later last year, the locust manifestation and floods destroyed majority posture and farmland deteriorating the already weakened communities.\nSomalia is one of the worst prepared countries in the world to contain the disease. WHO recommends the use of personal protective equipment, frequent handwashing and social distance to contain COVID19. Oxfam Somalia works with communities to promote these critical measures and raise awareness of communities on COVID19. Thissupport requires a close engagement with communities and health volunteers. However, since the first COVID19 case was declared in Somalia, we have limited our community contact and tried to see possible options to provide Real-time support to our communities. This included using a mobile-based application, Well Beyond, to provide COVID19 prevention and containment training. This trail was found to be effective and efficient. We are now proposing the scale up the same approach to expand to include other training including hygiene promotions, WASHCO training, WASH <(>&<)> Protection related training.\nCOVID19 has changed our traditional ways of living, working and our regular ways of implementing programs. For ownership and sustainability, it is critical to ensure communities' involvement in program design and implementation. In COVID19 environment, this can only be possible by using technologies to deliver training, information and collect feedback.\nWe wish to deploy critically needed information into the Oxfam Somalia regions of work through the Well Beyond App. This life-saving mobile technology sends interactive COVID-19 and Sanitation and Hygiene training material tothe community based health voluneteers. The technology will fill knowledge gap between COVID-19 recommendations and the tools and knowledge available in the remote, rural places. It serve by providing vital training material, guidance on handwashing stations, surface hygiene, sanitation and real-time chat support, and other tools to help communities prevent the spread of COVID-19. At the sametime, Oxfam Somalia will be able to track training completions and collect data on the solution\u2019s success. This will allow the Oxfam field team to continuously interact with our beneficiaries and community health volunteers.\n\nThe UN Economic Commission for Africaprojected more than hundreds of thousands of Africans could lose their lives due to COVID-19. The Somali government, in alignment with the WHO, emphasizes that basic, preventative measures by individuals and communities remain the most powerful tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but delivering this critical information has been a challenge, as the movement within countries is very limited, and social distancing guidelines prohibit large group trainings in person. The Well Beyond App will allow us to provide this crucial guidance to our CHVs and support to our communities, even though we aren\u2019t physically able to be there.",

Accountability is \u201cthe process of using power responsibly, taking account of, and being held accountable by different stakeholders, and primarily those who are affected by the exercise of such power\u201d . It is the right to be heard, and the duty to respond.\n\nHowever, anecdotal information indicates that where CBFCMs initiatives and experiences exist in Oxfam, many are still disjointed, some are uncoordinated, and largely undocumented. In many places, they are non-existent, or if they are, not all of them are fully functional. The design of Oxfam\u2019s CBFCMs by Affiliates, Country Offices and in part Partners has not always ensured community involvement, in most cases resulting in not fit for purpose mechanisms. Also different affiliates still approach the issue of CBFCMs differently with different emphasis, approaches, tools and resources, therefore lacking a standardised coordinated approach.\n\nAlthough Oxfam prides itself for encouraging communities we work with to speak out and report PSEA and child protection concerns and incidents concerning them,recent reports in some countries like DRC, Ethiopia, and Uganda not only attests to the limited awareness at community level on SEAand child protection risks and reporting mechanisms, but has also led to an increase in attention to ensure that SEA and child abuse and exploitation by humanitarian and development organisations like Oxfam are addressed through investment in preventive approaches but also responding to reports of abuse and exploitation when these incidents are reported.\nOxfam has two responsibilities for accountability in the programmes it manages, holding a responsibility for mutual accountability with its partners (as do the partners) and also holding a shared or joint accountability (with its partners) to the communities affected by its programmes. There is lack of knowledge how the\nIn addition to some of the above challenges, COVID-19 has added additional challenges to how effective current CBFCMs are, placing additional barriers to reporting that are currently not fully understood or risks mitigated.\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:\n1.

        "description": "The eastern regions in Somaliland and especially Saanag and Sool regions continue to suffer from recurrent drought. This situation has increased the vulnerability of the communities as they have lost most of their livestock which was their main source oflivelihood. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two regions also continue to experience occasional inter clan fighting which isoften triggered by competition for available pasture and water resources. Drilling of the a boreholes will not only contribute to providing important water sources that can support the water needs of the communities during drought and harsh climatic conditions, but also contribute to reducing risk factors leading to conflict. It will offer an opportunity to the benefiting communities to have a chance for better access to potable water, reduce the incidents water related diseases and increase access for water for practicing frequent handwashing to prevent COVID-19.\nObjectives;\n\u2022 Provide sustainable water source for 5000 people and over 10,000 livestockheads in Sanaag Region.\nGroundwater Feasibility Study:\nA groundwater feasibility study will be conducted in three selected villagesof Sanaag region. the study will follow three approach method,\n1. Remote Sensing: Desk review using latest satellite imageries to selected best possible locations. This phase will focus on finding regional fractures carrying water from highland of Ethiopia to thelowland of Sanaag regions and from Sanaag mountains to low land areas.\n2. Geophysical Study: ground truthing work will be conducting using latest start of art geophysical technology at least three locations with spacing of 1000 -1500m. This location are those selected in first phase of the study work. Government and community engagement will be conducted to understand the local geology, possible impact of drilling on environment and stability of the communities.\nDrilling of the borehole\nBased on the groundwater feasibility study, the drilling work will be advertised through the local media. In order to avoid failures resulted from improper use of drilling equipment and selection of drilling method, the contractor will receive full copy of the study report and will be given a briefing on the drilling technology and technique recommended by the study team. Then, a payment by result approach will be used to contract drilling companies i.e. Oxfam/Taakulo will only pay if the borehole has water with discharge of above 2liter per second. Failureto get a contractor willing to commence drilling with such conduction, further meeting will be help between Oxfam and Taakulo to discuss best possible approach to increase value for money.\nSupervision and Monitoring:\nIn drilling works supervision and monitoring progress is critical step. Oxfam/Taakulo will have a site supervisor equipped with necessary materials for supervision including TDS Sensor to record water quality at each 1 meter, mud funnel to record the drilling mud viscosity and deeper to follow the depth of the drilling. The supervisor will provide daily update to both Oxfam/Taakulo team and will ensure all decision that affect drilling performance is consulted and agreed before action. TDS level will be recorded in monitoring tool provided and the result will be used for deciding the borehole casing arrangement. All materials that will be used for drilling will be inspected by the drilling supervisor and approve. In case a specialized chemical will be used for the drilling; the supervisor will request for all safety related certificate prior use of such chemicals.\nPost Drilling Construction:\nThis action will be decided right after the drilling is completed. Provision of submersible pump with cable and riser pipes, and construction of generator house, water distribution system for both animal and human and storage facilities will be included under this phase. Other grants, including ECHO 2021 and/or other internal grants will be used to finance this critical activity. Incase the borehole salinity is above an acceptable regional level i.e. 2500ppm, provision of desalination unit will be considered.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions ability to provide q\nuality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer t\nhan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also imp\nlements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021.

        "description": "Long-running conflict has destroyed the infrastructure of the Somali state and the country has one of the worst health indicators in the world. The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Cares Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results show\n that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health care\n for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that \neventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneousl\ny invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the \ntelephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proje\nct's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinics personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB)  especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: d\nisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat  fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is th\ne low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case detect\nion rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and prisone\nrs)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of Soma\nliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of tu\nberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease stigm\na/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tubercul\nosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge.

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proj\nect's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinic?s personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

The additional funding supports the Somaliland Ministry of Health efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic health consequences\n for 3 months. To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three outputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Loc\nal health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increased capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Som\nali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developing strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child hea\nlth. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health outcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has b\neen evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide quality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the plann\ning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer than in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora expe\nrts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also implements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 un\ntil August 2020. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

        "description": "The Daryeel Mobile Health Clinic ?project aims at providing preventive and basic health care services to rural areas outside of Afmadow town in Jubaland Somalia. The project is executed by the Finland-Somalia Association (FSA) with partner NGO SAHDA and th\ne Jubaland Ministry of Health. The project is a continuation of the Maternal and Child Health Services Clinic ?project that the FSA has ran since 2011 in Afmadow town. Based on an agreement with the Jubaland Ministry of Health the FSA has been asked to swi\ntch its foces to more remote villages through a mobile clinic. The mobile clinic is to start its operations in 2018 depending on permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland. With this application the project plan is to continue the Mobile He\nalth Clinic through 2019-2020 a total of three years.The main development problem that the project aims to solve is the poor access to preventive and basic health care in the Afmadow area in Jubaland Somalia. The project aims to take health services close \nto remote communities where it is difficult to get access to basic healthcare and where travelling is a challenge. By curing and providing basic health services in remote locations the project contrib-utes to creating a healthier community and society with\n people who are able to work for their own livelihoods. In this context the project contributes significantly to achieving the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals. The development impact that the project strives for is to increase the wellbeing of the commu\nnities in the project area and to decrease the number of diseases and illnesses.The mobile clinic concept includes three core outputs:1. Supporting existing healthcare by providing health services in suburbs nearby villages and towns2. Providing supportive\n services in first aid family reproductive services and interventions reducing infectious diseases in the target villages3. Reducing travelling for health services from the towns as well as building the competence of the local community in health particula\nrly by giving tools and knowledge to local midwives.",

The project will focus on developing the institutional capacity of IND especially its HR Department in order to strengthen the legitimacy of \nthe Federal Government of Somalia in the field of immigration and border management. The project will utilize diaspora and international experts in developing capacity and strengthen IND?s infrastructural capabilities to deliver quality public services.   \nThe project will be implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) during a period of 14 months in 2020 - 2021.

        "description": "1. Project: 12091 Improving employment and livelihood opportunities for Somali and   youth through TVET and business skills development    2. Project area and Country: Hargeisa, Somaliland3. Project justification: Somaliland is one of the poorest nations i\nn the world. About 60% of Somalilanders are youth aged 15-35 years old; among those 40% are aged 15-29. The overall adult literacy rate across Somaliland is of 45.3% (50.2% among men and 40.2 among women). The unemployment rate in Somaliland among youth ag\ned 14-29 is 67%, one of the highest rate in the world, with women experiencing higher unemployment rate at 74% than men at 61%. The majority of the employment is classified as vulnerable employment with low wages, low level of social security, poor working\n conditions, and limited worker rights, with women experiencing more vulnerability than men do. Poor to no level of education leaves the vast majority of youth with little opportunity to access the labour market, rendering them without hope and perspective\n. 4. The main objective and the expected results:The project aims to contribute to sustainable and profitable employment and self-employment opportunities for male and female youth from IDPs, host communities and returnees in Hargeisa of Somaliland. The ai\nm is going to be achieved by following FCA?s thematic pillars of right to livelihood (R2L) and right to quality education (R2QE). FCA intends to pilot the integrated approach of Linking Learning to Earning (LL2E) aimed at providing both male and female you\nth with quality and market driven TVET trainings, which are informed by labor market assessment, combined with 1) career guidance and counselling, 2) close collaboration with private sector for market driven curriculum development, and provision of interns\nhip, apprenticeship and job placement, 3) entrepreneurship and business development, and 4) effective collaboration with the government institutions and private sector to promote TVET, employability and business opportunities.  Right-holders/beneficiaries:\n 60 TVET learners and 410 male and female secondary school learners. 5. Duty bearers: Local government agencies, parents, caregivers, community leaders and traditional and religious elders, and private sector. 6. Implementing partner: FCA Somalia Country P\nrogramme",

        "description": "This project addresses the need for locally trained female teachers and teaching assistants in Galgaduud region of Somalia, which until seven years ago had no tradition of education. This organisation has already opened eight schools and runs four literacy campaigns, but the difficulties of recruiting and retaining teachers are immense. There are very few trained teachers from the area, and teachers brought in from elsewhere tend to stay for only short periods, and are exclusively male. There is a severe shortage of trained teachers in Somalia, and very few women have had the opportunity to train up to a professional standard. This particular project provides teacher training through a two year certificate course run by a local university but based in schools. This means female student teachers can live at home, making accessing the training easier. Because they are drawn from the local area, they are less likely to leave the region. The impact will be long term and educationally significant.",

        "description": "In summary, this project proposes to contribute to three core aspects of Camp Coordination and Camp Management in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District, including leading essential coordination functions, developing and maintaining camp infrastructures that have been devastated by recent flooding.establishing/Rehabilitating/Enhancing drainage systems in IDP sites through incentivized workdays carried out by site-level site maintenance committees, and promoting humanitarian accountability through the operation of feedback and complaint mechanisms. Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money.

        "description": "Displacement, cramped living conditions and other related stressors following flooding all serve to exacerbate tensions and increase violence in the home and in communities, with women and girls most at risk. With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries. Approximately 50 (20 girls and women) will be engaged in GBV safety audit and action planning in their communities. 4,000 (1,220girls,1,260 women, 800 boys and 720 men) will be reached through door to door community outreach and over 25,000 reached through GBV radio advocacy and awareness creation. 450 dignity kits and 250 emergency support kits and 2000 sanitary kits will be distributed. Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management. Through the two WGSS, a total of 800(400 women and girls) will be reached through weekly GBV prevention and response sessions.",

        "description": "In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region. There were more than 5 accidents with fatalities and casualties in the Danyiile district alone this year which includes children and persons with no knowledge of Explosive ordinances.\n\nIn Afgooye about 191,143 persons standing as 100% of the population severity level no 3 described as degrading which puts them highly in need of protection against the explosive substances. Of these 56,000 are IDPs from the floods and other natural calamities while 135,431 are host communities according to the data recently shared by the protection cluster on HNO.\n\nExplosive ordinances contamination presents a barrier to development, and encumber livelihood activities particularly it affected IDPs, returnees, animal herders, and the rural poor families.",

Jointly with the protection monitoring activities, the key focus of the project will be providing Case management services to GBV survivors. Strengthen and improve the protective environment of vulnerable people in areas affected by flood from further risks of exclusion, exploitation and violence. SOYDA will mobilize 20 PSS counselors to deliver one on one and group psychosocial support and counselling for traumatized women and girls in the IDP camps. The counselors together with community mobilizers will sensitize the community and provide basic psychological support to the GBV survivors, to early or forced marriage and vulnerable girls. \n\nOn the child protection aspects, The proposed project is designed respond to child protection needs by addressing multiple protection risks faced by girls and boys through a comprehensive set of activities in well-coordinated and gender-sensitive approach by supporting children at risk and survivors including unaccompanied or separated children through case management services that meets their unique needs, as well as preparedness measures for speedy family tracing and reunification (including psycho-social support). The project will also work with volunteers to prevent and mitigate risks to children by building their capacity on rights approach of whom support identification and basic support to vulnerable children (including psycho-social first aid - PFA). SOYDA will also work with caregivers on positive parenting as well as provide psycho-social support to vulnerable caregivers affected by floods and made worst by the pre-existing emergencies related to conflict in Somalia as well as COVID-19. Additionally, the project will engage with the community on protection awareness raising on prevention messages on recruitment/or use of children by armed actors, gender-based violence, harmful practice, family separation and risk of dangers in the community (including in IDP camps or the local community) while coordinating with the CP AoR in service mapping operation of the standardized thematic tools and procedures.",

        "description": "Based on the analysis of the current flood situation in the target locations, NoFYL intends to extend its protection monitoring programme to contribute towards enhancing protection, increasing safety and promoting dignity of conflict-affected women, men, girls and boys, in Kismayo and Balcad. These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.     Increased availability of legal services for post flood HLP issues.\n\nNoFYL is currently an SPMS partner leading data collections in Kismayo, Afgoye and Mogadishu (Deynille amp Kaxda districts).",

The villages are home to pastoralists and agrarian communities.  Other villages that are affected by the floods include Athale, Haji Ali, Mahaday, Sabuni, Congo, Grasweyn and Adow uul. According to OCHA updates 1 on Deyr Season Floods Update, as of 4 November 2020, the flood in Jowhar affected 27,364 person living in Jowhar .The update also reported that on 3rd and 4th November 2020, flash floods cut the road linking Jowhar to Mogadishu at a location 10 km south of Jowhar.  The floods also affected the road to the airport. On 12th and 13th October 2020, heavy rains triggered flash floods in the riverine villages affecting about 3,600 people.  The Jowhar authorities reported that two children drowned as the result of the flash floods.The floods caused various impact to the WASH facilities the findings indicate that only less than 10% of the total affected population have access to safe water drinking water. Most of the infrastructure such as latrines have submerged and destroyed as the result of the floods. Sanitation is a serious issue due to the inadequate number of latrines in comparison to the population in need and many people are practice open defecation due to lack of sufficient latrines against the population. Lack of adequate and safe sanitation puts women, girls and at risk of physical violence and sexual assault as they relieve themselves in the open field.The water have been contaminated and not fit for human consumption leading to potential outbreaks of water-borne diseases and acute water diarrhea.Therefore, in order to fill the gaps Islamic relief Somalia with funding from OCHA is planning to fill the gaps by rehabilitating of 5 shallow wells, two 2 boreholes and construction of 200 flood latrines.The project aims to tackle the effects emanating from the floods by providing emergency WASH services in Jowhar district, Somalia. The intervention is in line with the WASH strategy. It will also link to recovery and resilience building of the communities by rehabilitating WASH infrastructure that will assist 16,500 direct beneficiaries affected by Hagaa floods in Jowhar .The project will install solar power systems to the two (02) boreholes that are to be  rehabilitated  in jowhar depending on the needs while the rehabilitation of five (05) shallow wells will be undertaken at Mahaday,gumeysta,congo,marerey and cali warabey. The shallow wells will be rehabilitated, protected and upgrading including the installation of Two (2) boreholes that will be rehabilitated will be connected to water piping system including construction of four (4) water kiosk from the main borehole, gender balanced water management committees will be formed and trained. Islamic Relief Somalia will provide emergency water trucking to 4,000 beneficiaries in the rural areas of Jowhar district Each beneficiary will receive water in accordance with sphere standard of (7.5 liters/ per person per day). Water through tricks will be delivered on daily through blanket system which ensured beneficiaries know the quantity and where water should be collected.The displaced population in Jowhar are at risk of contracting malaria, acute bloody or watery diarrhoea, measles and other sanitation related diseases, The project will construct 200 emergency pit latrines to reduce AWD cases and improve the sanitation services. The latrines will be designed in line with the protection guidelines and segregated according to the sex. 20 latrines will be designed to meet the special requirements of people with disability.The project will construct and install 10 COVID-19 hand washing stations in order to  prevent COVID-19.The IDPs and the host communities will benefit from hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and production of IEC materials.1500 HHs will receive hygiene kits.",

The combined forces of CCCM and WASH aim to deliver essential COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement activities while establishing necessary water points and handwashing platforms for better hygiene practices.  Moreover, the use of radio media will look to provide an additional layer of awareness and critical thinking related to community-based responses and prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society, and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites. AVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster\u2019s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster\u2019s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster\u2019s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group. SCC (separate proposal): Through joint collaboration, SCC will be working WASH partners to organize hygiene promotion activities supported by CCCM partners via mobilizing community members and certain targeted members of the IDP sites. When feasible, WASH partners will provide emergency WASH services to IDP sites (water supply, hygiene promotion-installation, of handwashing stations, and distribution of soap for handwashing to sites that do not have access to these services.

The floods have displaced in Wanlaweyn alone more than 82,000 people, inundated homes, wells and schools and destroyed large swathes of farmland and crops The heavy deyr rains ave caused massive population displacement, damaged housing, property, infrastructure and farm lands in riverine areas in southern Somalia. WASH Cluster has reported critical gaps in Balcad, Marka and Wanlaweyn where no WASH assistance has been received despite high risk levels for AWD.\nThe main aim of this project is to provide lifesaving WASH services to most vulnerable and underserved communities living in floods affected areas in Wanlaweyn district of Lower Shabelle Region. A total of 17,000 flood affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally throughout the project period.\n\nSOYDA in collaboration with the local authority, partnership with main water vendors in rural villages in Wanlaweyn district, will provide emergency water voucher to the 6,400 (1408 men, 1,536 women, 1,728 boys and 1,728 girls) targeted beneficiaries including people with disabilities and marginalized communities in the targeted IDP camps, which they can redeem for water at the specified water vendors (water trucks). The action also includes to hire water truck of a capacity of 6,000 liters of safe water to the targeted locations. Each voucher can be used to redeem specified quantity of safe water of 7.5 liters per person per day for a period of 30 days. The project will build the capacity of 1q WASH Committees (composing 4 men and 3 women per Committee) shared equally men and women on operation and maintenance of developed water infrastructures shall be throughout the project implementation period, to ensure the sustainability of the developed water facilities after the project is faced out. SOYDA will make sure that men, women, girls and boys including people with disabilities and marginalized community have equal access to the rehabilitated/constructed WASH services. SOYDA will upgrade/rehabilitate two boreholes equipped with hybrid to improve its water quality and reduce its running cost, in order to receive the community their water needs at an affordable cost. SOYDA will replace the engine powered boreholes in to hybrid system and construct 8 water kiosks nearer to the IDP settlements supplied water through piping network to avoid the risk of rape against women and girls in Wanlaweyn district. The project will provide reliable and sustainable access to environmental sanitation through construction of 100 IDP latrines in Wanlaweyn district. The latrines will be gender separated and flood proof with lockable doors and hand washing basins. construction of latrines will be implemented through market-based programming. \n\nSOYDA will distribute 80 sanitation sets to 10 IDP camps, in order to improve the environmental sanitation of the targeted locations. The aim of the sanitation sets distribution is to carry out clean-up campaigns, in order to reduce the spread of AWD/cholera diseases and to improve the environmental sanitation of the target locations. SOYDA will conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns focusing hand washing with soap practices to 17,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, health facilities, and nutrition centers. SOYDA will also train 30 Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) shared equally men and women, selected from the target communities and IDPs, so that in their turn they can educate the entire population to change their behaviors. 1600 HP kits will be distributed to the most vulnerable and underserved communities in the target locations",

The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management.

WASH intervention will be complemented by PAH through the distribution of complete kits of hygiene, capacity building of water committees and community hygiene promotion through community outreach and awareness campaigns, addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs. ESNFI intervention will be complemented by HINNA by improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and emergency shelter kits.\n\nAt the initial stages of project implementation, the partners will organize an inception meeting with different actors with the support of the relevant cluster Coordinators. Rapid service mapping of actors will also be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervention areas and avoid duplication. NoFYL field teams shall actively participate in coordination mechanisms in Kaxda and Deynille to ensure other actors are updated on NoFYL plans in targeted districts to avoid overlap. This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI, CCCM, Protection, and WASH support and complement activities undertaken under other ongoing projects. NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation. The synergy between the 3 sectoral partners will ensure sound management of the program, greater impact, efficiency, and more cost-effective operations.

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

        "description": "Despite a favorable Deyr (October- December) rainy season, the lingering effects of the drought in 2018/2019, and flooding an estimated 1.3 million people in Somalia will be in Crisis (IPC Phase3) through mid-2020 without sustained humanitarian assistance. Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019. PDM also monitors expenditure patterns of the provided support and determines measures for corrective actions if there are deviations from objective.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is that the food security situation of 865 vulnerable households (5160 individuals) in mostly rural communities in Zeylac district of Somaliland is stabilized and communities are more resilient towards adverse conditions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers: a) unconditional and b) conditional cash transfers for improved access to food. The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

Of these,  200 HH are IDPs located in Abudwaq town. \nOutput 2 targets 1,632 HH (9794 people) in the protection and restoration of their livelihoods for increased food and income sources. Of these, 900 HH will benefit from animal treatment meant to restore approximately 27,000 livestock to better health. This intervention will improve the livestock economic value as well as the value of meat and milk for household consumption. 6,000 additional and emaciated livestock will receive animal feed concentrate for a month to help them recover their health and increase production. The project will install a solar-powered pumping system to pump water from the Dalsan village borehole to the elevated village water tank which will then use gravity to distribute to the village water kiosk and livestock watering troughs that were constructed by NAPAD with funding from German-FFO. Over 430 HH in Dalsan will benefit from climate and economic friendly source of water for their livestock estimated to be 12,960. To increase household access to nutritious food 100 women will be supported to diversify into small scale kitchen gardening of vegetables and fruits. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The farms will be designed to ensure that the least amount of water is utilized in agricultural production. Women from the Dalsan village will especially benefit from the proposed solar water pumping system that will provide water to irrigate the kitchen gardens. Inagabille households and livestock will get their water from NAPAD constructed, G-FFO funded elevated 60,000 litres tank and animal troughs. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The gardens will be designed to use low amounts of water in vegetable production.",

The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. World Vision Somalia (WV Som)  will work  with MOH to address the health and nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and persons living with physical disabilities in the 2 targeted districts. 1 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the unique needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated populations in  Burtinle district.  Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with SAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be  registered through SCOPE to access  TSFP that is supported by WFP. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the  SCs that World Vision propose to support in Burtinle  district.  At each of the 4  MCHs, WVI shall establish basic reproductive health care services aligned within the MISP framework, utilizing the ambulances to refer mothers with complications from the MCHs and PHUs to the hospitals. At each PHU WV shall build the capacity of the community midwives to provide basic reproductive health care services in remote hard to reach areas as a mitigation measure against preventable maternal morbidity and mortality. While engaging community volunteers, WV shall adopt Timed and targeted counselling (TTC) approach focusing on pre conception to the first 1000 days of a child\u2019s life also incorporating the Finish baby kit and Fortified rice and lentils (Vitameal) as a motivator for adoption of promoted health seeking practices among WCBA through enhancing access to Reproductive health care services, child health including Immunization ,IYCF and hygiene promotion care and care-giver led MUAC screening and referral . At 4 targeted MCHs and PHUs WV has an already established GBV care system with personnel already trained and necessary CMR supplies in place to respond to GBV cases.  World Vision will ensure that beneficiaries visiting the targeted facilities including beneficiaries served at the mobile sites access a comprehensive basic package of services .Towards health and nutrition promotion, World Vision will focus on NHHP, care-giver led MUAC screening that will be done at the project sites with the nutrition beneficiaries is linked with the food security and safety net interventions to enhance household food basket.",

        "description": "The proposed project has been developed in line with the Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the health and nutrition cluster strategic objectives of providing integrated lifesaving health and nutrition services for the cluster priority districts in Nugaal regions i.e. Garowe districts. It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.\nThe project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.\nSave the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.\nWe would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.",

Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

        "title": "Providing Integrated Health and WASH services to marginalized and vulnerable IDP and Host communities in Burdhubo",
        "description": "Trocaire has been the main provider of Health services in Gedo since 1992, operating all main hospitals in northern Gedo in partnership with District Health Boards and, more recently, the Ministry of Health. This proposed intervention will provide integrated lifesaving Health and WASH services to 3,987 men, 3,767 women, 3,588 boys, and 3,404 girls from Burdhubo location in Garbaharey district. These will include approximately 7,373 IDPs, 7,373 host community members, and 730 individuals with different forms of disability. Trocaire will work closely with the government District Medical Officers, the Burdhubo District Health Board, the District Commissioner's office, other implementing partners and with coordination through the Health and WASH clusters. Coordination will be prioritized as it remains a key assumption of the project for effective and efficient delivery of integrated lifesaving assistance to vulnerable and marginalized populations in Burdhubo. Health interventions aim to provide primary and essential lifesaving services in an inclusive manner. With a few private health facilities in Burdhubo, the population remains under-served, with children, pregnant and lactating mothers facing unimaginable challenges as they walk long distances of up to 40 kilometres to access health services. Trocaire will therefore work with the above stakeholders to re-establish affordable, accessible, and inclusive health services to both vulnerable IDP and host communities. This will require minor rehabilitation of 1 static health facility- Burdhubo Health Centre, and equipment and management of 1 mobile outreach team that will access beneficiaries in 5 outreach sites. Waiting shades will be constructed in these five sites to ensure dignified assistance is provided in a safe, accessible environment. Health workers will be trained to handle different components of health activities including Clinical Management of Rape, immunizations, emergency trauma care, communicable disease treatment, TB screening and treatment etc. Specialized services, which require referral to nearby hospitals, will be facilitated. The Trocaire-managed health facility in Garbaharey town will be the main referral point, as it is equipped as a referral hospital.\nWASH services will complement health services through relations with the health outreach teams, working closely to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, as well as reducing cases of malnutrition. Preventive approaches will be utilized through 11 hygiene promotion sessions with community-based staff/ volunteers. Hand-washing practices will be promoted through distribution of 1,000 hygiene kits through restricted cash vouchers in collaboration with the WASH cluster hub, as well as other partners on the ground, if any. According to assessment data collected in early March 2020, about 90 percent of the population in Burdhubo use untreated and unsafe water from the river, which is also too far a distance for most of the HHs. Within this project, Trocaire will seek to construct one hybrid shallow well with water treatment encouraged at the household level to encourage uptake of safe and clean water. One representative Water-User Management Committees (WMCs) will be set up to manage the shallow wells created. 70 emergency latrines will be constructed and hand-washing facilities with soap installed. Hygiene promotion sessions will be held. Trocaire is discussing with other partners to ensure that once this project is operational there will be opportunities to continue implementing necessary services, and working closely with the local, regional and national stakeholders to ensure that they are well equipped to continue provision of these services, when time is right for Trocaire to exit.",

Children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) will be referred to the TFSP, while those with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) will be referred to the OTP run by SUADO. Complicated cases of SAM will be treated in the stabilization centre (SC) in Jalalaqsi. Tracing of children that have defaulted from the SC programme will be established and carried out by the SC teams. Provision of therapeutic and supplementary feeding for malnourished children lt5 and PLW will be provided during the programme period. Children not progressing well under treatment will be visited at home for counselling for their mothers. \nMercy-USA will ensure that nutrition site will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will secure agreements with WFP and UNICEF before the start of the program. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. \nMercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and provide refresher trainings for staff.\nThis programme will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. \nScreening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level, though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programme. \nChildren in the nutrition programme will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A according to IMAM guidelines. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anaemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anaemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition programme will receive deworming drugs. In addition, children in the nutrition programme will receive relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A according to Somalia IMAM guidelines. \nSerious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia. Mercy-USA will thus support provision of routine EPI activities. This will continue to increase immunization coverage among women and children lt5 years. Nomadic groups and remote or difficult to access communities are most at risk of missing out on routine EPI. Therefore, Mercy-USA will facilitate outreach EPI teams.",

        "description": "Evictions represent a unique protection challenge in Somalia with far-reaching consequences on physical security, dignity, and livelihood of victims. Bossosa is one of the epicenters of the problem as the region struggles to recover from the residual effects of the 2016-17 drought amid persistent insecurity, cyclic natural disasters, and widespread unlawful evictions. At the national level, Somalia is faced with the daunting prospect of rebuilding the country having been riven by more than two decades of conflict and lawlessness. Important strides are being made to address the issue but ongoing initiatives have been outmatched due to the prevalence of the problem, thus necessitating a more robust, integrated and coordinated program response. In the absence of an effective response to address protection challenges that are being exacerbated by eviction, displaced communities will remain at risk of continuing secondary displacements. Efforts to strengthen protection and contribute to durable solutions to displacement in Bossaso will be incomplete and/or undermined without addressing the issue of eviction concurrently and systematically. The project seeks to contribute towards ensuring that individuals affected by displacement receive support assistance to improve their tenure security situation and address post-eviction complications.\n\nThis action builds on NRC\u2019s hands on expertise in evictions prevention and response programming in Somalia, and targeting 37,198 individuals in Bossaso, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced communities at risk of eviction and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of log lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities aimed at reducing the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthening tenure security among displaced communities at highest risk of eviction, and consolidating the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include supporting the establishment of dedicated evictions prevention capacities at the municipality of Bossaso, replicating eviction programming best practices at the municipality, helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash, and strengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities. A parallel objective of the HLP Sub Cluster which this project will seek to advance is consolidating HLP capacity among national organization.\n\nA combination of deliverables will contribute toward the mitigation of protection risks exacerbated by evictions through integrated prevention and response initiatives ensuring that displaced communities have increased access to information and specialized services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights and supporting local mechanisms to address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion.",

According to joint assessments conducted by NRC, AVORD and NRC in March 2020, the humanitarian situation in Xudur is dire and require immediate attention. Generally, Xudur faces serious humanitarian challenges as the district cannot be easily accessed by humanitarian actors safe for a small radius of about 25kms from the main town. Al Shabaab operations remain high and the security situation is in unpredictable. The already congested IDP sites are receiving new influx on daily basis burdening the already fragile. Water, Protection, Shelter and security issues were the greatest needs among the IDPs and displacement affected communities. Almost 80% of the IDPs have lost their assets as well as means of livelihood such as farming and livestock and are unwilling to return their places of origins. Water supply and sanitation services are needed, only 1/3 of the population have access to the already overwhelmed sanitation services, while over 70% of go out for open deifications.

The primary modalities for delivering service will be through the scaling up of direct service provision to GBV survivors using integrated referral pathways for clinical management of rape, service mobilization through women and girls\u2019 safe spaces. Some of the key activities include: Improving access to rape services for GBV survivors Providing comprehensive services including GBV case management, legal aid, psychological first aid/support accompanied with referral for appropriate services capacity building of actors, medical support, facilitate access to legal services through referrals, provision of dignity kits and solar lanterns, access to psycho-social support through counseling to GBV survivors, facilitate referral to ensure access to appropriate services. This approach incorporated harmonized approach to access services through both preventive and response mechanism. The response measures shall enhance access to referral for medical support, access legal support by making referral to other partner organizations, access to dignity kits to the survivors and also to women and girls at risk of GBV, solar lanterns and psycho social support. This shall therefore increase accessibility to quality and coordinated GBV services for conflict affected communities in Laas Caanood, Taleex and Dharkein Ganyo and strengths resilience among the vulnerable populations including Internal Displaced Population (IDPs) and poor host community through awareness. TASS will also undertake a comprehensive mapping of existing referral pathways for GBV survivors on how they can access to the services and challenges in remote target locations and maintain monitoring and reporting of GBV incidents for prevention and response actions. While implementing the activities we will work closely and use the existing structures to strengthen the coordination with stakeholders/clusters, partners and government structures and /or women and girls\u2019 friendly spaces and avenues.

The project will seek to improve the retention of already enrolled children living in flood-affected areas into the quality and inclusive basic education in a safe and protective learning environment. \n\nThe project will target and support 8,750 children (40% girls) in 20 schools, the most affected schools will be selected in coordination with regional coordinators will receive light rehabilitation and furnishing of desks and chairs, provision of teaching and learning materials to 8,750 learners from 20 schools, provision of dignity kits to 2000 adolescent girls to enhance their daily school attendance, provision of recreational materials to 20 schools that are tailored to the needs of children, Provision of community-based psychosocial support in schools, the establishment of 20 temporary child-friendly spaces (CFS) that will support the provision of PSS, recreational activities and non-formal education activities. On the protection front, the project will identify specific protection needs, inform service provision and serve as an entry point for specialized service provision with boys and girls. Targeted psychosocial support, psychological first aid, case management, and emergency referrals will be provided to child survivors of rights violations, Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC), and children who show signs of trauma. 500 children will be targeted for IDTR and PSS provided, of which 30% expected to be reunified with their families. \n\nThe proposed intervention will create synergies with existing programs focusing on child protection. The caseworkers and monitors in the present proposal will act as a reference for the referral pathways aiming at connecting services in the communities. Before starting the implementation, HIWA will coordinate with Shelter, protection, WASH, and CCCM to ensure complementarity and reinforcement of the project approach. HIWA has a strong experience in child protection in emergency and in resilience context and has previously implemented child protection programs funded by UNICEF in Beletweyne and Buula Burte, through this experience HIWA has established linkages with community leaders, local authorities and camp leaders making access and acceptance easier in the target locations. HIWA will coordinate with the regional education cluster during the implementation of the project. Coordination with WASH cluster will be essential in implementing the project, HIWA will work closely with Wash partner who will carry out hygiene promotion in schools and also ensure the water sources in the schools are safe.\n\nOpportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration within and beyond the HIWA education and protection sectors will be sought. The collaboration will include emergency operations with cluster partners to ensure a comprehensive approach and view of education and child protection. HIWA will use the strength of its relationship with the regional education and protection clusters to share information and collaborate in service provision to avoid duplication of activities in the selected schools. Before implementation starts, HIWA will liaise with the regional coordination structure to identify schools that have not been targeted by other partners. HIWA will also closely work with Relief International and Qatar foundation on hygiene promotion and other WASH interventions. Referrals will be directed to them where WASH needs are identified in different schools.",

        "description": "Increased rainfall since the beginning of September in both Ethiopian highlands and within the catchments in Somalia has resulted in a sharp rise in the Shabelle and Juba rivers, leading to severe flooding in southern and central Somalia. According to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), the recent Shabelle river flooding displaced over 270,000 people, of whom 230,000 are in Beletweyne District. Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. According to the FAO-led Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the rains are projected to continue in the coming weeks and it is expected to end in early December. DRC proposes to undertake a life-saving and sustainable assistance to Flood- Displaced people in Beletweyne through provision of emergency shelter kits (ESK), non-food items (NFIs). DRC will target 2050 households (12,300 people) with ESK and NFIs. The standard emergency NFI package will include plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamp and Jerry cans. Where possible, DRC will give the NFIs through cash transfers or vouchers so that beneficiaries can decide based on their needs. DRC will also assist with a standard ESK that contains: Local available stick for vertical post (Philippian Tree) Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philippian Tree) or White wood (8cm x 4cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing or White wood (5cm x 2.5cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) at the base of roof truss or White wood (10cm x 2.5cm size each) Nails No. 5 (5 inch) Nails No. 6 (6 inch) Drum door with frame Hinges for door Local plastic sheet (size: 4m x 7m) and outer wall clothing Buul layer. This provides the most basic shelter which can offer protection from extreme weather. The ESK helps the displaced household to put up by a 4m x 4m shelter structure within the first few days of displacement. DRC is aware that the needs are huge and the available funding cannot cover everyone. DRC is also aware that families of affected persons are normally the first responders and therefore, some families may be better positioned to survive such disaster due to their own social networks. Therefore DRC will develop a selection criteria based on AGD as well as vulnerability to ensure that assistance goes to the ones who deserve it most. Female-headed households, families with many children and the aged (65+ year-olds) will be given priority. DRC will also ensure that, persons living with disabilities (PLDs) or families with such persons are also targeted with assistance.  Families considered extremely vulnerable, will be assisted by DRC to put up their shelter through cash paid after erection. DRC determines that this cash shall be 60 USD and targets 540 hhs out of 2050 hhs. DRC will undertake a post-distribution monitoring (PDM) study four (4) weeks after distribution to measure the effectiveness of distribution and also the satisfaction of the beneficiaries on the items distributed. This will help inform future programming in shelter, NFIs and CCCM programming. Specific to CCCM, DRC shall engage in installation of solar lights and in settlement maintenance including clearance of any solid waste and access roads. DRC will also, jointly with the camp/settlement committees undertake mapping of available services and establish a referral system. Through that, DRC will establish information boards at strategic points like social centers like water points and markets for people to have easy access to information. DRC will support community governance structures through trainings to ensure that camp/settlement committees can manage their daily issues in a structured manner. At sub-national level, DRC will ensure coordination of CCCM meetings happen and deliberations are reported.",

The nutrition cluster priority districts in Hiran region including Beletweyne due to critical levels of GAM rate at 19.6 and SAM of 4.1. The project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected populations. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project includes construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health, nutrition and WASH services through the support of static health facilities and mobile outreach to the flood affected populations in Hiran, particularly Beletweyne District. There will be 8 sites that will provide integrated health and nutrition services for flood affected communities, offering outpatient consultations, routine immunization, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTPs, TSFP, IYCF-E and referral to stabilization centers. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will also be provided. Special focus will be given to prevention of disease outbreak and malnutrition, improve early identification malnutrition by empowering mothers to use MUAC screening, access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThe WASH component in health and nutrition will also improve good hygiene practices, rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure, more equitable and better access to sustainable water points for drinking and handwashing with soap, and provision of basic sanitation services in these facilities. Hygiene and sanitation support and promotion will be provided in an integrated approach in the health and nutrition sites. There will also be outreach nutrition, hygiene and health promotion within the community and in schools. This will empower children to be agents of change for hygiene promotion.",

        "description": "Flood triggered displacement is on the rise in Middle Shebelle, with new areas engulfed by floods water during the wet season every day. The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

        "description": "The rains that have inundated parts of Somalia are expected to continue in November with moderate to heavy intensity, according to the FAO Managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM). Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

Also this project is working to rehabilitate WASH facilities damaged by the floods including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding. It will contribute to the reduction of emergency WASH gaps reported and works to improve the hygiene practices of the affected communities through kit distribution and awareness campaigns. \nThe project is for 6 months targeting a total beneficiary of 30,000 individuals living in Baldweyn. This reserve allocation will enable QC to scale up flood responses in Beledweyn and reach more beneficiaries in the coming months. \n1.\tThis Project will work to provide emergency water trucking through voucher to flood affected communities in Beledweyn. Currently, potential high-risk areas for the water trucking activities are areas where people are displaced to. A total of 2,500 households equivalent to 15,000 people will be supported  with water voucher for 3 months and each person will be provided 15 l/p/d (acceptable WASH cluster standards in Somalia), with total of 2,520 trucks.\nQC will also provide water to health/nutrition facilities and schools within the target communities. QC will competitively contract water vendors to supply households with agreed quantities over the specified period. Households provided with vouchers will access their allocation of water at the water distribution point on a daily basis. The community water monitors will register the collection of the water in a register book with the household representative and signing or thumb print as a record. All the supplied water will be chlorinated. In addition, a list of recommended boreholes will be mapped out for water trucking. This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

        "description": "The proposed six-month project aims to provide urgent lifesaving assistance to flood-affected communities in Beletweyne while mainstreaming protection and integrating sustainable, flood-resistant solutions. The WASH intervention will improve the health and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in flood-affected communities through increased access to safe water, use of latrines, hygiene promotion and increased adoption of safe hygiene practices. Cash programming, in the form of conditional transfers, vouchers, and cash for work (CfW), will form a core pillar of the proposed intervention. Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

        "description": "This proposed action aims at increasing sustainable access to wash services for the most vulnerable population in Diinsor District. The action is in line with the SHF reserve allocation 2019 hence targeting one of the most undeserved communities in hard to reach areas as prioritized by the call for proposals. Specifically, the project will enable INTERSOS to fill the WASH gaps through provision of sustainable WASH assistance package including innovative solutions that can contribute to durable solutions. \n\nThe overall objective of this response is to provide Sustainable life-saving WASH services to the most vulnerable in Diinsoor district to improve access to safe and sustained water and hygiene educations, reduce acute watery diarrhea AWD/cholera incidences and WASH related diseases through Drilling and equipping of one strategic borehole with solar-diesel hybrid pumping system that will help in lowering the cost of system operation and more importantly lower emission of carbon footprint. Hydrogeological survey will be conducted in Dinsoor town to identify the suitability of ground water. Complete water distribution networks with elevated tanks and water consumption points (water kiosks) will be installed and constructed as per the available designs and BOQs. All water construction works will be constructed through service contracts with reputable water infrastructure companies who will be supervised by INTERSOS Engineer based in Diinsor. INTERSOS will employ local specialised manpower in order to rehabilitate and develop 11 existing shallow-wells through construction and raising of concrete aprons, de-silting to increase the yield of the wells, India mark 2 water pumps will be installed to ease fetching, watering trough will be built to separate the human consumption from livestock water consumption. \n\nMoreover, INTERSOS will introduce manual drilling of wells that are located in the water bed of the water streams or seasonal with pvc pumps. 11 wells will be drilled using this innovative technic. 3 local technicians will be trained and will be given materials and tools to support the population and start a sustainable and profitable business. The safety of water will be guaranteed through water treatment at the water sources while training of water management committees will embed sustainability through improved operations and management and cost recovery measures, water quality monitoring at the source and household level and where necessary will provide remedial measures through awareness raising on safe water handling by regularly conducting sanitary surveys to suspected water sources to identify risk factors, treatment options like chlorination will be done during rehabilitation and development of these wells and boreholes. \n\nIn addition, the project will address the sanitation and hygienic behavior among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion and provision of hygiene kits to 1000 households, distribution of water purification tablets to acute watery diarrhea AWD/cholera suspected homes, institutional hygiene promotion. Hygiene promotion will be built on people\u2019s own knowledge of risk and disease prevention to promote positive health-seeking behaviour. \n\nINTERSOS is currently the only INGO present in Diinsor and the only humanitarian actor implementing wash programs in the District as described in the paragraph coordination and complementarities, majority of the sanitation activities will be conducted in the same targeted location through a project funded by the Italian Cooperation moreover, this project will contribute to a nutrition outcome since INTERSOS will enhance complementarities in the same area with an ongoing nutrition project funded by SHF (a scale up of the same project being discussed with UNICEF).\n\nA total of 21800 (5,308 women, 5,376 men, 5,200 girls and 5,916 boys) are expected to benefit from this project action.",

        "description": "FSNAU post deyr 2018 assessment indicated critical levels of acute malnutrition among rural and pastoral populations with critical GAM gt15 and Serious SAM rates reported in Bakool region. The ongoing Gu rains 2019 (April to June) started late and have performed poorly and are likely to further aggravate the vulnerability of drought affected population including IDPs, poor host communities in Elbarde in Bakool region. These IDPs and poor host communities experience limited access to basic services including access to WASH services. The contributing factors include drought, dry jilaal season (January \u2013March 2019), displacement coupled poor WASH infrastructure. The prolonged drought in Bakool region led to limited access to sustained safe drinking water and increased risks related to  acute water diarrhea and malnutrition among population in Elbarde district in Bakool region. \nAccording to HIDIG WASH assessment conducted between 27- 28 May  2019 indicated that majority of affected population (80%) in ELBARDE district can't afford the cost of water due to increased price of water (55% increase) exposing thousands of families to walk more than 45 minutes for water collection which expose women and adolescent girls risks for gender-based violence. The assessment report indicated that, between 70-80% of shallow wells (26/38 wells in the assessed locations) are on open source condition and hence expose to contamination of water and to increases incidences of AWD cases. In addition, HIDIG/UNICEF health facility report in May 2019 indicated that AWD and skin diseases were among top five disease reported. To respond this alarming situation, the proposed project will improve access to WASH services for a total of 23000 drought/AWD affected communities (including 5750 women , 6900 girls, 6900 boys and 3450 men) IDPs and host communities in Elbarde district in Bakool region. The organization proposes sustained solution to improve access to WASH services services of the affected people in line with Somali WASH cluster response plan:\nWater: 1. Provision of sustained access to safe drinking water to through construction/rehabilitation of one boreholes equipped with hybrid and supplied water to two kiosks through piping system to two kiosks. Extension and construction of water supply systems in IDP camps benefiting 12000 drought affected men, women, girls and boys in Elbarde district. \n2. Construction/ rehabilitation of 12 shallow wells with hand pumps benefiting at least 11000 drought /AWD affected communities in Elbarda district \n3.  To ensure the sustainability and the management of water facilities, HIDIG will ensure to enhance the capacity of WASH committees to keep the maintenance and operation of the water source after the project is faced out.  HIDIG will ensure the maintenance and the appropriate use of water facilities in close coordination and coordination with IDPs mainly camp committees (men and women). \nSanitation :Construct 100 flood proof gender sensitive desludging latrines with hand washing facilities and with inside and outside lockable door to ensure the privacy of women and girls. around men, women and children are equally\n Hygiene promotion activities : HP will carry out comprehensive hygiene and sanitation promotion awareness campaign to promote the adaption of good hygiene and sanitation practices to affected men, women and children. \nSustainability : The rehabilitated  water sources (boreholes) will also serve as the main water supply sources to support neighboring villages with water trucking in the recent dry seasons.ill .The propose WASH investments will help affected communities in accessing sustainable water sources and eventually  reduce the impact of recurrent droughts ,climate shocks and improve their resilience in long run",

In addition, 903,100 children under the age of five years will likely face acute malnutrition in 2019, including 138,200 who are likely to be severely malnourished. \n\nTension and occasional clashes between Somaliland and Puntland over the contested Sool and Sanaag regions has led to displacement of more than 1000 households to nearby locations. According to reports from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency, the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume anytime. Baidoa district is one of the main hubs for IDPs and presents critical gaps in terms of humanitarian coordination and information as well as service provision. Drought conditions combined with a proliferated conflict with Al Shabab has exacerbated displacement. An estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance, including Baidoa and Sanaag IDPs. Conditions for IDPs are likely to deteriorate unless humanitarian support is scaled-up. \n\nIn the presented context, through CCCM, ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement these activities in 42 IDP sites in both Sanaag and Baidoa 39 previously supported IDP sites in Baidoa (ref: SOM-18/3485/SA1/CCCM-WASH-Shelter/INGO/8671) to build on the gains achieved through the SHF integrated support by focusing on capacity building, self-management and handover of activities to communities 3 new IDP sites (Karasharka, Fadhigaab, El-Midgaan) in El-Afweyne district of Sanaag, targeting a largely undeserved area. 6,443 HHs (approximately 38,658 people) in Baidoa and 1,222HHs (approximately 7,332 people) in Sanaag, a total of 7,665HHs will benefit from this intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas.",

        "description": "This project seeks towards the strengthening camp coordination and camp management in order to ensure equitable access to services and protection for displaced persons in informal settlements. People displaced to informal sites do not have their basic needs met due to the inconsistent provision of services or exclusion from accessing humanitarian support as a result of poor targeting of sites. This project seeks SHF allocation towards the strengthening camp coordination and camp management in order to ensure equitable access to services and protection for displaced persons in Banadir region. Majority of IDPs in Banadir region settle in informal and unplanned settlements where the conditions are very poor and forced eviction is a common threat, and where newly displaced people join those whose displacement has become protracted. Many are displaced multiple times. CCCM will strengthen the predictability and effectiveness of multi sectorial interventions at site level through continuous mapping of displacement settings, improved community participation and continuous monitoring.\n\nNoFYL is aware of challenges existing around land and property tenure arrangements, including customary access rights to land when selecting sites for the construction of the community centers. Where the land or property is privately held, NoFYL will consult with relevant stakeholders to obtain authorization and a long term formal agreement from owners to ensure long term sustainability of project constructions. \n\nThrough this project, NoFYL will reach 4,203 HHs in 7 IDP settlements with a total target beneficiary of 19,218 in Deynille and Kaxda districts with necessary services through coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stake holders and other partners. Targets in Deynille being the following camps Dayax Centre (550HH), Dheegan Bille (437HH), and Sabriye IDP camps (816HH) while Kaxda the project will target Samawade Camp (500HH), Alanfutow (270HH) Husungow (360HH), Ceel Hareeri (270HH) and Alhidaya IDP camps (1000HH).",

        "description": "This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 9,000 IDP households (54,000 persons) in Kaxda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including setting up and strengthening of camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of temporary, multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping and site monitoring will be undertaken in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nAn integral part of the proposed intervention is to support community led site maintenance activities through cash for work schemes to ensure upkeep of sites. During the course of project duration, AVORD will also distribute a range of tools for effective disaster and solid waste management. Critical site infrastructure including 240 latrines and 40 main gates will be upgraded to minimize protection risks and enhance safety at sites. In the selection of beneficiaries for cash-for-work activities, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",
