Households and communities must recover, adapt and diversify their livelihoods and asset base in order to cope effectively during both harsh dry seasons and disaster episodes. SomReP\u2019s approach acknowledges the need to recover from shock quickly and its programming seeks to promote the local absorptive and adaptive capacity of households and communities. While promoting drought recovery, the program also builds institutional capacity, strengthens the natural resource management that underpins resilience livelihood, and prevents loss of livelihood assets through proactive early action.\"",

        "description": "1. Early married/adolescent mothers/ adolescent girls who have dropped out: Low to no expectation that these girls will enroll or re-enroll in school. Girls themselves are reluctant to enroll/re-enroll they are embarrassed to enter school in a class with younger children. At mid line, 81% of caregivers stated age as an important deciding factor as to whether a child should attend school. Intensive accelerated learning classes will be key to enabling these girls to increase their learning level and to engage/re-engage with school amongst girls their own age. Nuanced messaging through BCC campaigns will raise the community support for girls of all ages to prioritize schooling. 2. Disabled girls: Low to no expectation that these girls will enrol in school. For those who are enrolled they are not expected to achieve at the same level as their peers. The teacher training module will be developed focusing on basic approaches to inclusive education, enabling teachers to better engage with disabled children in the classroom. Additionally, disabled girls will be targeted for bursary support. 3. IDPs, refugees, returnees Girls may have fled a conflict situation; violence and upheaval may have a negative impact on psychosocial wellbeing. Due to limited mobility, girls miss school and fall behind. These factors can lead to a general expectation, of the girl and her parents, that girls will not progress and succeed in school. Girls in these groups who are extremely poor will be identified for bursary support ensuring economic barriers do not prevent attendance. Additionally, psycho social support from trained teacher mentors will aid an increase in girls\u2019 well being. 4. Orphans, minorities and other girls from poor households Girls are often expected to leave school early, if they enrol at all, to look after siblings and contribute to family income, with school-going costs understandably a lower priority. Bursary support will help enable girls from poor households to attend school, despite the economic challenges they face. 5.Children of lower learning ability/demonstrating low performance in the classroom The percentage of caregivers stating that a child\u2019s ability should be an important factor determining whether a child should attend school reduced from 88% to 43%. Specifically designed messages promoted through BCC activities will increase community support for children of all abilities to attend school. Remedial classes will help those children keep up with the learning levels of their peers.",

In doing so, it facilitates the implementation and monitoring of humanitarian interventions in numerous life-saving thematic areas. In most countries requiring humanitarian assistance, challenging security situations, long distances and poor road conditions impede surface travel. Also, adequate commercial air operators do not serve most of the destinations the humanitarian community needs to reach.  As such, aid workers rely on UNHAS to provide access in situations where reaching isolated communities is not otherwise feasible. This project operates in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen.

        "description": "This Program Document proposes a Reengagement and Reform Development Policy Financing (DPF) for the Federal Republic of Somalia in the amount of US dollar 420 million from International Development Association (IDA) grant resources. The objectives of the proposed DPF are to facilitate full normalization of relations with the World Bank Group (WBG) and support Somalia's economic recovery through policy reforms that strengthen fiscal management and promote inclusive private sector-led growth. Up to SDR 271.2 (up to US dollar 375 million equivalent) of the proposed grant will be disbursed to the bridge-loan creditor assisting with arrears clearance (\u2018Portion A of the Financing\u2019); and SDR 32.6 million (US dollar 45 million equivalent) will be disbursed to the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) as budget support to meet cash flow needs after Somalia has cleared its arrears to IDA (\u2018Portion B of the Financing\u2019). The DPF complements a rapidly expanding engagement to build human capital and strengthen resilience to climate change and other shocks. In FY2020, the World Bank is currently delivering technical assistance to develop livestock insurance, a major Urbanization Review, and upstream analysis on health and education that are expected to inform new financing. The DPF also addresses the above challenges by enabling full reengagement with the WBG. The DPF will facilitate Somalia's clearance of arrears to IDA, which is a requirement to qualify for international debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Full reengagement with the international community through the HIPC process is expected to enable Somalia to access the financial and technical support the country needs for sustained poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. Normalization of Somalia's relationship with IDA would give the government's access to financing from IDA's Crisi",

Luglio 2019 ha segnato il livello pi\u00f9 basso di raccolti agricoli a partire dal 1995, il 70 sotto la media, con conseguenze umanitarie disastrose sulla popolazione. Le abbondanti piogge dell'ultimo mese hanno tuttavia provocato inondazioni nelle aree agricole, distruggendo sia gli insediamenti umani sia la produzione agricola Inoltre la mancanza di strutture igienico sanitarie di base ha causato il diffondersi del colera, della malaria e di altre malattie trasmissibili. Si stima che circa 5.4 milioni di Somali si trovino in condizione di insicurezza alimentare e necessitino di interventi urgenti per la sopravvivenza. L'intervento prevede attivit\u00e0 di emergenza anche volte al rafforzamento della resilienza con approccio DRR (Disasters Risk Reduction), di chi si trova in situazioni vulnerabili, aumentandone la capacit\u00e0 di fronteggiare futuri shock climatici, economici e sociali.",

        "description": "This project aims at restoring stable communities in Somalia through establishing local structures that research, identify, analyse, prioritize and implement solutions to community security issues, in collaboration with local authorities, formal security actors and civil society. At the state level, it will re-establish bodies that promote community-responsive policing, acting as a link through which information on security provision is channelled, and form bridges between local, state and national levels. Learning and insights from all levels will be fed upwards through national-level civil society networks, promoting community-focused security provision at national and international level. The objectives of the programme are to strengthen the capacity of local civil society groups and communities to research and facilitate broad dialogue across clan and state-society divides about local security issues, provide resources for implementation of joint conflict prevention and community security initiatives, support cross-regional community exchange to share experiences and common security problems, link community members with existing dispute resolution mechanisms, support the re-introduction and development of regional oversight mechanisms such as police accountability committees with channels for community input, provide training on accountability, gender- and conflict-sensitivity, link these bodies into a cross-regional learning network, facilitate their engagement in policy dialogue at the federal member state level, conduct policy discourse with the Somali federal government, regional bodies and international actors to communicate evidence about inclusive approaches to improving human security, and facilitate dialogue among policy-makers at the national level and communities. This will eventually result in a reduction in inter and intra-clan division and violence, more inclusive, responsive and accountable security provision including effective mechanisms to prevent misuse of power and improve coordination, greater coherence in policy formation between Federal regions, and more evidence-based policy and programming on human security from international actors.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

        "description": "The\nconflicts throughout Somalia have evolved over the past three decades, with the\ncurrent state of violent extremism predicated on the exploitation of\npre-existing clan grievances.

The road to peace and development remains a long-term process, with\nsome regions being ahead of others. Currently, the most at-risk regions\ncorrelate with those that have remained marginal to development and\nhumanitarian interventions, including, inter\nalia, Middle and Lower Shabelle; Middle Juba, Galkayo District in Galmadug\nstate and parts of Bakool region. Longstanding clan grievances coupled with\nland and resource scarcity and political representation have led to al Shabaab\nexploiting the existing tensions making these regions fertile ground for\nconflict and displacement. \n\nThe\nproposed Action will primarily target the main urban centers where the\ndisplacement crises has been contributed to deepen the urban crises. Cities and\ntowns like Johwar and Beletweyne but also Dhusamareeb have a tremendous\ninfrastructure backlog. The floods in 2018 along the Shabelle River have caused\nadditional damage to urban infrastructure (see also Humanitarian Needs and\nResponse Plan 2019).\n\nThe\nprogramme will be aligned with and built on existing government priorities,\nplanning frameworks and strategies for both catalysing stability gains in the\ncountry, restoring state authority in recovered areas and finding lasting\nsolutions to displacement.

        "title": "Dhulka Nabaada (Land Of Peace): Land Reform In Somalia",
        "description": "After decades of insecurity and political instability, Somalia currently stands at a critical juncture for stabilization, peacebuilding and development. The prolonged conflict, in conjunction with the slow rise of political and state legitimacy, leaves the country with almost no functioning institutions and or rule of law. In 2012, the reestablishment of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), marked progress towards more permanent governance structure.Despite the considerable progress made in the last few years, the country still faces many challenges regarding political stability, peace and economic progress. One of those key challenges relates to land issues and how to address them in a systemic way in order to contribute to overall peacebuilding efforts.Land becomes intertwined with conflicts in various ways, primarily when dispossession takes place, or when rights to ownership, land use, access and transferability are consistently and arbitrarily violated. Any disruptive or forcefully imposed change on how groups and individuals connect to their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia has - resulted in various forms of organized violence and community disruption. Clan dynamics have also been a contributing factor to land conflict when there has been competition for the control of resources . With little to no effective state control of land or its administration, management and governance; armed groups and individuals can illegally acquire land, dispossess people, and forcibly evict the most vulnerable without due process. Those with access to social, economic and political power, coupled with the ability to use violence, have been able to illegally gain titles or control over land. The insecurity of tenure is also a significant barrier to the integration and economic development of displaced persons and communities. With the constant threat of forced evictions, displaced and vulnerable groups do not invest in the land, which impacts their ability to seek a livelihood.Political and socio-economic elites, and terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab, and the public at large including displaced populations are all current actors when it comes to land issues in Somalia. The State, due to political stagnation, insecurity and lack of institutional capacity has not been able to assert control over land management and governance or produce adequate land policies and legislation. An important role for the State will be to reclaim all public property and develop a cohesive land system that can produce policy or regulatory frameworks that govern land and land use in accordance with the rule of law. Elite groups with access to militia and financial resources are another actor whose unregulated actions disproportionately impact land markets and fuel land disputes and conflicts.Al-Shabaab remains a significant threat to the state and communities in many parts of the country and in most of the regions proposed for this programme. Different sources also assert that because of lack of trust in the formal justice system which is perceived as corrupt and clan based, people will prefer to go to Al-Shabaab courts to ensure protection of their land rights rather than to the formal court system. The public, including both host communities and displaced persons, is also another actor and the end-users this programme seeks to reach. Most often, the weakest and most vulnerable groups, they often face legal uncertainty, lack of protection and consistence violations to their housing, land and property rights.Another contributing factor to the land conflict dynamic in Somalia, which has only become more pronounced in recent years is migration and displacement. Due to years of conflict and natural disasters, millions of Somalis have been displaced and dispossessed of their land. Recent trends of returning refugees from neighboring countries and those who have been in a state of protracted displacement has resulted in large communities of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vulnerable groups living in informal settlements with little to no access to tenure security. Because of the current trends, it is predicted that this dynamic will continue, and programs must account for the reality that not only will rapid urbanization rates require urban resilience measures, but also promoting social cohesion is vital to peacebuilding initiatives. Protective measures for vulnerable groups through safeguarding basic human rights and enhancing security of tenure is not only important for land tenure purposes, but it also facilitates reintegration and economic development that can help stabilize and develop the region.Land disputes and conflict have disproportionate impacts on different groups within society. Women and youth are amongst the most disenfranchised when it comes to equal access to land use and ownership. With little formal recognition of rights to land and a male dominated customary land adjudication process, the rights of women are often periphery in land discussions. Ownership of land for Somali women is often linked to male relatives for greater protection. Such a reliance however limits their agency and poses a significant disadvantage to women-headed households. This programme will work towards enhancing women\u2019s access to justice as end-users and encouraging their participation in land governance and adjudication systems.Youth make up much of the Somali population, approximately 81.5% of the population is under the age of 35 . Despite the high number, this does not translate into proportionate political or social representation. They face numerous systemic barriers and require targeted advocacy to ensure that their rights are enforced. This project will benefit from, and work collaboratively with the PBF-funded Youth Political Empowerment project currently being implemented in Jubbaland and South West State. This program will aim to incorporate and integrate youth and their experiences, it will encourage their participation and ensure protection mechanisms are in place for them. Other vulnerable groups, including clan minorities are also marginalized when it comes to land access and rights. Using a human right centered approach to land management and supporting governments to standardize and promote land rights is key to a fair and equitable land reform process. By encouraging the participation of women and youth in land dispute resolution mechanisms we can begin to appropriately reflect the diversity of the communities in judicial and quasi-judicial processes.This project intersects on each of the five strategic priority areas from the UN Strategic Framework, and will directly support the realization of three of them:1. Supporting institutions to improve Peace, Security, Justice, the Rule of Law and Safety of Somalis 2. Strengthening accountability and supporting institutions that protect3. Strengthening resilience of Somali institutions, society and population8By enabling governments to address land conflicts in a meaningful way, this project will establish land dispute resolution mechanisms to enhance access to justice, improve security and contribute to overall peace and adherence to rule of law. To ensure full national ownership this project hopes to create enabling dynamics that allow national, state and local governments to take the lead and institutionalize these efforts. This project will not only contribute to the UN\u2019s strategic priorities, but also supports and aligns with several of the pillars of the Somali National Development Plan9 and the priority areas for each region. By working to improve land governance at local and national levels, this project contributes to enhancing Rule of Law, building effective and efficient institutions, supporting economic growth and safeguarding gender and human rights. Supporting customary and formal legal mechanisms that can address land disputes will work towards re-establishing the rule of law. A focus on land governance and management will also help build effective and efficient institutions that are better able to serve the public needs.The project is aiming at capacitating approximately 500 direct beneficiaries (local authorities and community members) to information management system to register land, as well as approximately a total of 200,000 indirect beneficiaries (50,000 per target location) benefiting from improved justice mechanism and land information management systems.",

        "description": "The proposed project studies war induced rapid urbanization processes in Somalia from the viewpoint of the most vulnerable in-migrants, people who were internally displaced (IDPs) in the cause of the on-going war. It investigates security perceptions and practices of IDPs in four cities of Somalia (including Puntland) and Somaliland and thereby focus on the capacities that vulnerable populations develop to cope with the effects of violence and displacement and to mitigate their vulnerability. Grounded in the everyday (Lefebvre, 1971 2016, De Certeau, 1984; Felski, 1999) and bridging urban and security studies, the project foregrounds people's own understandings of security, which risks and threats they identify, however narrow or broadly defined, and how these risks impede on their daily life (Crawford   Hutchinson 2015). In particular, the research asks: What does security mean and on which security arrangements do urban IDPs rely in the everyday? How do social, political, economic and environmental factors shape dynamics of everyday security? What continuities and change characterize security arrangements and everyday security in the course of migration to the city? With photo-voice, the project additionally proposes a methodology that gives 'voice' to people who are usually overheard or silenced, without however relying solely on their verbal capacities.",

The local government has been trying to address this problem\nby identifying land for resettlement, but lacks the financial and technical\ncapacity to address the pressing housing situation and to find lasting\nsolutions. UN-HABITAT, with previous funding from the Government of Japan, has\nassisted the municipality by providing low-cost housing, improved services, skills\ntraining and livelihood opportunities to returnees and IDPs at the Ayaha-II\nsettlement area, on the southern fringe of Hargeisa.\n\nThe interventions carried out under this project respond to the\ncontinuous need to improve living standards and provide durable solutions for\nreintegration and resettlement of displaced communities in Hargeisa. In\nparticular, the project aims to reduce tensions between IDPs and host\ncommunities and incorporates issues of protection, and spatial and\nsocio-economic integration through permanent resettlement and improvement of\nlivelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable groups (women and youth).\n\nIn particular, the proposed project will target the resettlement and\nprovision of durable shelter for 350 returnee   IDP families in Hargeisa\noriginating from congested urban IDP settlements like the \u201cState House Area\u201d, a\nlarge piece of former government land in the central part of the city, which is\noccupied by an estimated number of 3,000 people.

        "title": "Hargeisa Urban Water Supply Upgrading Project (Huwsup)",
        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve access to safe and affordable water and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable households in urban and peri-urban areas of Hargeisa city, through expanded supply of drinking water from sustainable water sources, and associated creation of employment opportunities.\nThe project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). \nThe specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: \ni. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; \nii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and \niii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.\nThe overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. \nAs requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. \nWhile the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:\nii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield\niii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. \niv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)\n\n\n\n\n[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project \u201cRehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System\u201d (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)",

For JPLG's overall\nobjective to be realised, a number of agents\nwill have to\npromote change that\ncan alter the\nstatus quo in\na direction that\nfosters a stronger, more\nresponsive and accountable\ncompact between the\nstate and its\ncitizens in the\nprovision of service delivery.\nDespite progress the\ncurrent context is\nstill characterised by\nlimited trust in\ngovernment structures at both central and local levels, which in turn\nmeans that their legitimacy is often contested.\nThis can increase the\nrisk of a\nreturn to instability\nand conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where\nradical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus\na need\nto consolidate and\nenlarge the space\nfor non-state actors\nin the rest\nof Somalia and\nto restore a healthy and accountable state citizen\nnexus. \n\n\n\nTo achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the\nprogramme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing\nstrategies: \n\n\n\n1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for\nfunctional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance\nthe role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a\nmeans to improve local service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 1 will focus on policy\nand legal frameworks across Somalia\nand is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on\ndecentralization in Somaliland and\nPuntland. These provide an incomplete\naccount of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local\ngovernment, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for\nimplementation. These issues need to be\nclarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and\ndistricts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; \n\n\n\n2. Improving local government capacity for\nequitable service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 2 aims to address the\nweak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a\ncomprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements\nof local administration. It also seeks\nto improve coordination between\ndistricts and the\ncentre in planning\nand programming to ensure\nbetter consistency and use\nof resources. A third output is concerned with increasing\nlocally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;\nand, \n\n\n\n1.\nImproving\nand expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,\nresponsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nOutcome 3 focuses on improving\nthe delivery of local services. This is\nto be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line\ndepartments, engaging more\ndirectly with non-state\nproviders, and enhancing\nthe accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another\nelement relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private\ninvestment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. \n\n\n\nIn all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the\nparamount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment\nand leadership. Without these ingredients,\nthe prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished.

Improving local government capacity for\nequitable service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 2 aims to address the\nweak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a\ncomprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements\nof local administration. It also seeks\nto improve coordination between\ndistricts and the\ncentre in planning\nand programming to ensure\nbetter consistency and use\nof resources. A third output is concerned with increasing\nlocally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;\nand, \n\n\n\n1.\nImproving\nand expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,\nresponsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nOutcome 3 focuses on improving\nthe delivery of local services. This is\nto be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line\ndepartments, engaging more\ndirectly with non-state\nproviders, and enhancing\nthe accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another\nelement relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private\ninvestment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. \n\n\n\nIn all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the\nparamount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment\nand leadership. Without these ingredients,\nthe prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek\nsupport and political commitment at the highest\nlevels of Government,\nand sustain commitments\nalready established in\nPhase I with\nthe Vice Presidents of Somaliland and Puntland nominated as Champions\nfor Local Governance.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve access to safe and affordable water and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable households in urban and peri-urban areas of Hargeisa city, through expanded supply of drinking water from sustainable water sources, and associated creation of employment opportunities.\nThe project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). \nThe specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: \ni. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; \nii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and \niii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.\nThe overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. \nAs requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. \nWhile the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:\nii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield\niii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. \niv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)\n\n\n\n\n[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project \u201cRehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System\u201d (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)",

        "title": "Federal Government Of Somalia And United Nations Joint Programme On Youth Employment",
        "description": "Skills development needs to be part of a comprehensive, integrated\nstrategy for inclusive growth. There needs to be greater private sector\ninvolvement and skills interventions with a sectoral focus. Skills development\nmust be tailored to the needs and aspirations of the young Somalis as well as\nthe needs of the private sector. It needs to fit within the overarching goal of\ndeveloping and maintaining a growth trajectory and competitiveness of various\nsectors of the economy that necessitates a skilled workforce that is aligned to\nindustry requirements. A comprehensive\nyouth skills package will be provided for youth from different\nsocio-economic backgrounds and according to the skills needs of the selected\nvalue chains that will have been analysed. We will utilize existing vocational training\ncentres to deliver competency-based training programmes which respond to the\nneeds of Somali employers, as identified during the value chain study.\nBeneficiaries will be provided with certification upon the completion of the\ntraining.Identifying current and anticipating future\nskills needs is the first building block of relevant training and skills\nstrategies. Several methods are\nused to forecast future skills needs. These include: forecasting occupational\nand skills profiles; labour market information systems and employment services;\nengagement with the private sector; and assessments of the performance of\ntraining institutions and the employment outcomes of their trainees.There exist opportunities for more specific technical and vocational training and\nentrepreneurship training at various stages of value chains, particularly\nin input supply and production to promote the inclusion of youth. Lack of\nskills in particular crafts is one of the biggest problems which can be tackled\nthrough the provision of well-designed training courses to increase the\nproductivity of youth. Similarly, opportunities for business start-ups and\ngrowth of existing businesses can be facilitated through a comprehensive\nmanagement/training programme aimed at starting and improving businesses and\nproviding business development services (BDS).It should be noted that youth aspirations are different from what is\noffered in some sectors, in particular the farming sector. Regardless of the economic opportunities available in the farming\nsector, young Somali men and women are being utilized as labourers within\nfamily farms which youth are not interested in.Key to the project strategy will be making the agriculture sector\nattractive for youth who are not necessarily looking to be involved in farming. This will be achieved through the involvement of youth in the\nlivestock, input provision and processing stage of the value chains which will\nbe selected. This is because youth will be involved in agriculture when it\noffers real business opportunities. Farming will also be attractive for youth\nif it is technology driven. Enhancing timely access to market information and\ncommunication, production techniques, new technology and financing\nopportunities will modernise the farming sector and will take full advantage of\na generation of young Somalis who are more technologically inclined, more\neducated and more willing to taking higher entrepreneurial risks than their\nelders.It is important that skill development initiatives do not only focus\non hard, job-related skills, but also on \u201csoft skills\u201d that are deemed more and\nmore important by employers and are needed for the personal growth of youth. The \u2018Youth for Change' initiative of UNDP, UNICEF, and ILO has shown\nthat through psycho-social rehabilitation and skills development, youth can be\ndiscouraged from joining criminal and violent groups, can recuperate, and can\ngive something back to their families and communities. This is a process of\nempowerment that can lead to children going to school and youths taking up\nvocational training. It shows how such engagement with youth can promote social\ncohesion and peace. \u201cSoft skills\u201d like leadership, personal financial planning,\ncommunication and information technology will encourage development of positive\nattitudes needed for employment. Other useful life-skills include health\ninformation, civic engagement, protection of rights and political inclusion.\nPsycho-social counselling and support services are necessary for youth who have\nbeen victims of violence and need re-integration into society and will be\nmainstreamed within the life-skills package. Building on a Construction Sector Analysis conducted under the SECIL project, a one-stop youth centre will be\nestablished in Mogadishu focusing specifically on construction skills\ndevelopment and building material production combined with life skills\ntraining. In order to specifically target young women, the one stop youth\ncentre in Mogadishu will also provide hospitality training.The three satellite centres will\nbe linked to vocational training centres rehabilitated by ILO and will be\nlocated in other urban areas than Mogadishu and will provide life skills\ntraining only. The main One stop youth centre\nin Mogadishu and the three satellite centres; this centre will utilize an integrated approach to youth\ndevelopment by providing both young men and women with safe spaces in urban\nsettings where they can undergo specialized vocational training(in the case of\nMogadishu), meet and access information and resources critical to creating\nlivelihoods. The Centre will also offer young men and women a choice of various\narts, culture, recreation, and health services. Separate programmes and space\nfor young men and young women will be developed where needed. This component will\nbe expanded based on the needs identified by the city and the youth of\nMogadishu.Capacity of Benadir Regional\nAdministration (BRA) to implement youth projects and mainstream youth aspects\ninto local government projects and programmes, in particular the one stop\ncentre, will be strengthened through the establishment and training of a youth\nunit and a youth advisory board at BRA. The Role of the youth unit and youth\nadvisory board will be established by BRA and FGS but may include mainstreaming\nyouth issues at the local level, policy development (for local government),\norganisation of youth events, job fairs etc. Both, youth unit and youth\nadvisory board, will be a model for other urban areas to be replicated and\nscaled up in the second phase of the programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of capacity development, relevant government ministries and institutions will acquire\ninstitutional and technical capacity development on methods of collection,\nanalysis and storage of labour market and skills data. Their national statistics\ncentre (Minister of Planning and International Cooperation) along with the Ministry\nstatistical units, will be strengthened with technical assistance from a\ntechnical expert who will be seconded to the line ministries. This assistance\nwill improve labour market information analysis processes and institutional\ncapacity at the national and regional level. The development of a full-fledged labour\nmarket information system will take many years; however, the proposed programme\nwill begin to train ministries and institutions for better collection and\nanalysis of data relevant to developing appropriate skills training programmes\nfor youth employment. Furthermore, tools, equipment and operational support\nwill be provided to vocational training institutions and the one-stop youth\ncentre. Identifying, selecting and training teachers in the development of competency-based\ncurricula, and in the delivery and assessment of these training courses, will\nbe core activities for capacity development of technical vocational training\ninstitutions. Furthermore, training managers will be provided with mentoring\nsupport to ensure the sustainability of vocational training centres.",

        "title": "Development And Pilot Implementation Of An Environmental Management System (Ems) At Un Support Office In Somalia (Unsos)",
        "description": "UNSOS is committed to reduce the environmental footprint of the mission\nin its host country, Somalia. It wants to improve the environmental performance\nof the mission by introducing sustainable design and operation (as much as the\nsituation in Somalia permits). This means addressing solid waste, wastewater,\nuse of energy and resource management as whole. UNSOS wants to achieve this by\nintroducing a systematic Environmental Management System (EMS) to each sector\nof the mission, which can be approved by an international organization of\nstandards (ISO) in the long-term. \n\n\n\nCurrently, UNSOS has a mission specific Environmental Policy (pending\napproval) that was drafted in reference to DPKO/DFS\nEnvironmental Policy for UN Field Missions, established in June 2009. The\npolicy defines environmental standards and objectives for UN field missions as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\u201cEach United\nNations field mission will take actions to integrate environmental measures\ninto its planning and operations in order to avoid and minimize the impact of\nactivities carried out by the mission and its staff on the environment and to\nprotect human health from such environmental impact. ?Such measures will be undertaken throughout all phases of a United\nNations field mission, including: Initial planning of the mission; setting up of logistic arrangements for the mission; maintenance and\noperations of the mission; closing of the mission.\u201d ?\n\n\n\nAn environmental policy (by itself) does not bring about a change in\npractices. Only the EMS is a guarantee that the Environmental Policy is\nactually implemented and that applicable standards are consistently met by the\norganisation during its operation. Only through the operationalization of a\npolicy will it be possible to minimise the environmental footprint of sector\nhubs and associated operations. Hence, the EMS means the operationalization of the environmental policy in place\nand to achieve set objectives and targets.\n\nThe Secretary General (SG) in his letter to the president of the Security Council dated 7 October\n2015 (S/2015/762 on the review of AMISOM and UNSOA) underlined that: \n\n\n\n\u201cThe impact on the environment of the United\nNations-supported activities in Somalia also remains a concern. The review\nnoted the absence of an environmental baseline study, dedicated environmental\nmanagement capacities and an African Union environmental policy to guide AMISOM\noperations, particularly with regard to wastewater management.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe strengthening of UNSOA and its conversion into UNSOS also includes\nthe development of capacities for adequate environmental management. \n\n\n\nThe Board of Auditors in its 2015 review of the operation of UNSOA formulated the following\nrecommendations: \n\n\n\nUNSOS is to develop a plan for undertaking and updating periodically\nenvironmental baseline studies of all Mission's locations in order to comply\nwith DPKO/DFS Policy on Environment for UN Field Missions.\n\nUNSOS is (a) develop a guideline of maintaining records of waste produce\nin the Mission; and (b) develop a database of waste produced in the Mission and\nupdate it accordingly. \n\nUNSOS is to develop effective mechanism such as action plan and effective\nmonitoring system for ensuring the Mission comply with the environmental policy\nrequirements.\n\n\n\nThe subsequent Security Council\nResolution (S/2015/840) stated the following:\n\n\n\n\u201cFurther requests the Secretary-General to consider the environmental impact\nof the UN fulfilling its mandated tasks, including carrying out an\nenvironmental baseline study and regular environmental impact assessments of\nthe operations of UNSOM and UNSOS.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll of the above mentioned elements point towards the fact that missions\nneed to take practical measures to obtain tangible results in order to meet the\nguidelines set forth in the DPKO/DFS Policy.",

        "description": "The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote\nimprovements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace\nconsolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall\nobjective to be realised, a number of agents\nwill have to\npromote change that\ncan alter the\nstatus quo in\na direction that\nfosters a stronger, more\nresponsive and accountable\ncompact between the\nstate and its\ncitizens in the\nprovision of service delivery.\nDespite progress the\ncurrent context is\nstill characterised by\nlimited trust in\ngovernment structures at both central and local levels, which in turn\nmeans that their legitimacy is often contested.\nThis can increase the\nrisk of a\nreturn to instability\nand conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where\nradical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus\na need\nto consolidate and\nenlarge the space\nfor non-state actors\nin the rest\nof Somalia and\nto restore a healthy and accountable state citizen\nnexus. \n\n\n\nTo achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the\nprogramme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing\nstrategies: \n\n\n\n1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for\nfunctional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance\nthe role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a\nmeans to improve local service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 1 will focus on policy\nand legal frameworks across Somalia\nand is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on\ndecentralization in Somaliland and\nPuntland. These provide an incomplete\naccount of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local\ngovernment, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for\nimplementation. These issues need to be\nclarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and\ndistricts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; \n\n\n\n2. Improving local government capacity for\nequitable service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 2 aims to address the\nweak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a\ncomprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements\nof local administration. It also seeks\nto improve coordination between\ndistricts and the\ncentre in planning\nand programming to ensure\nbetter consistency and use\nof resources. A third output is concerned with increasing\nlocally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;\nand, \n\n\n\n1.\nImproving\nand expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,\nresponsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nOutcome 3 focuses on improving\nthe delivery of local services. This is\nto be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line\ndepartments, engaging more\ndirectly with non-state\nproviders, and enhancing\nthe accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another\nelement relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private\ninvestment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. \n\n\n\nIn all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the\nparamount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment\nand leadership. Without these ingredients,\nthe prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek\nsupport and political commitment at the highest\nlevels of Government,\nand sustain commitments\nalready established in\nPhase I with\nthe Vice Presidents of Somaliland and Puntland nominated as Champions\nfor Local Governance.",

        "description": "UN-Habitat\nhas worked with the issue of public space for 15 years or more. However, at the\n23rd Governing Council of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States\nasked UN-Habitat to place a larger focus on public space and how it can\ncontribute to sustainable urban development (Resolution 23/4 on Sustainable\nUrban Development through Access to Public Spaces). Specifically, UN-Habitat is\nmandated:\n\nTo advance the agenda on place-making and\n     public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and international\n     approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\n     UN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces\n     and the quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange,\n     cooperation and research between partners working in this fieldTo develop a policy approach on the role\n     that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of our rapidly urbanizing\n     world, to disseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a\n     plan for ensuring its application internationally;To assist in coordinating UN-Habitat partners in\ndisseminating knowledge to existing sustainable urban development processes at\nall government levels.Globally,\nthe growing attention to\npublic space informed the 23rd Session of the Governing Council of\nThe United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in 2011, where\nmember states mandated UN-Habitat to consolidate agency-wide work on public\nspace, to develop and promote public space policy, coordination, disseminate\nknowledge and directly assist cities in public space initiatives.[1]\n\n\nAgainst this\nbackdrop, UN-Habitat established in 2012, a Global Programme on Public Space\nnow working in 30 cities. The world secretariat of the United Cities and Local\nGovernments (UCLG) has created a Strategic Planning Committee chaired by the\ncities of Porto Alegre and Durban with a strategic focus on global advocacy,\nestablishing regional networks of cities working on public space, supporting\nlearning exchanges, tool development and documenting good practices in\npartnership with UN-Habitat. The Italian Institute of Urbanism (INU) has been\ninstrumental in developing the Charter on Public Space as well as hosting the\npublic space biennale.\n\nAnother great\nmilestone which has been achieved is the adoption of the 2016-2030 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals which adopted a Goal 11 \u2018Build cities and human settlements\ninclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\u2019 One of the proposed targets set\nout is \u201cby 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible,\ngreen and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and\npersons with disabilities\u201d.\n\nThe adoption of\nthe SDG 11.7 by the General Assembly in September 2015, constituted the most\nsignificant attention ever to public space in the global policy arena. However, continued support for SDG 11,\nand in particular public space Target 11.7, will be even more important to\nensure adequate means of implementation and a sound monitoring framework that\nwill be necessary to catalyse action on public space as a contribution to\nsustainable cities and human settlements. This will require that cities invest\nin public space and in the spirit of the new urban agenda cities and local\ngovernments should take an integrated, trans-disciplinary approach by working\nin partnership with a range of stakeholders and organizations, including civil\nsociety, academia and the private sector to ensure inclusive, safe and\naccessible public spaces for all.\n\nIn 2013-15, the Future of\nPlaces (FoP) initiative significantly contributed to raising awareness around\nthe public space agenda on a global level. The FoP is a multi-stakeholder\ninitiative which was established by Ax:son Johnson Foundation, UN-Habitat and\nProject for Public Spaces (PPS) bringing together a large and diverse network\nof stakeholders around the issues of public space through a series of annual\nconferences (2013 in Stockholm, 2014 in Buenos Aires and 2015 in Stockholm\nagain). The Future of Places gathered leading global thinkers, academia,\ndecision-makers, practitioners, other UN Agencies, media, communities and\nprivate sector that subscribe to the transformative power that good quality\npublic spaces can have in a city. All together the network represents about\n1,500 individuals from 700 organisations, from 275 cities, across 100 countries. The success of this initiative has shown the\ncommitment of a wide range of actors with a stake in public space, as well as\nhighlighted the global importance of this theme. In a short time it has created\na global movement for public space (10.000 followers on twitter) contributing\nactively to highlighting its benefits and putting it on the global development\nagenda.UN-Habitat has worked in\nthe area of public space for over 15 years. However, at the 23rd Governing\nCouncil of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States asked UN-Habitat to\nplace a larger focus on public space and how it can contribute to sustainable\nurban development. Specifically, UN-Habitat is mandated: \n\n\n\na) To advance the agenda on\nplace-making and public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and\ninternational approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\nUN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces and\nthe quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange, cooperation\nand research between partners working in this field; \n\n\n\nb) To develop a policy\napproach on the role that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of\nour rapidly urbanizing world, to\ndisseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a plan for\nensuring its application internationally;\n\nc) To assist in coordinating\nUN-Habitat partners in disseminating knowledge to existing sustainable\nurban development processes at all\ngovernment levels.\n\nThe project is\nalso aligned with the UN-Habitat Strategic Plan 2014-2019 and specifically to Sub-programme\n2: urban planning and design and expected\naccomplishment 2: integrated and\nparticipatory urban plans and public space for compact, inclusive and\nconnected cities.\n\nFor example, the project links with the\nfollowing UN-Habitat interventions:\n\n\u00b7\nUrban\nBasic Services: Sustainable Urban Transport in East African Cities (SUSTRAN)\nProgramme\n\n\u00b7\nParticipatory\nSlum Upgrading Programme (PSUP) \n\n\u00b7\nMunicipal\nSpatial Support Programme (MuSPP)\n\n\u00b7\nThe\nSafer Cities Programme\n\nUN\nHabitat is also a knowledge leader in the public space arena, developing tools\nand guidelines as well as contributing to global thinking through the Habitat\nIII issue papers, policy units, amongst others. Moreover, UN-Habitat has commenced several partnerships on the global\nbut also on the regional level focusing on issues related to public space. Therefore, UN-Habitat is perfectly\nplaced to take advantage of the opportunities presented by SDG11.7 on public\nspace and continue working on public space for the next four years.",

        "title": "Youth Political Empowerment: Enabling Somali Young Women And Men To Meaningfully Engage In Governance, Peacebuilding And Reconciliation Efforts",
        "description": "In light of the context and gap\nanalysis, the proposed intervention seeks the support of the UN Peacebuilding\nFund to increase the inclusion of young men and women in state and\npeacebuilding processes in Somalia. More specifically, since Somalia is in the process\nof reestablishing legitimate State institutions and systems of governance at\nthe Federal Member State and District level, this intervention seeks to\ncapitalize on this in order to ensure these structures are including young men\nand women and take their priorities into account. With the passing of the Local\nGovernment Laws in South West and Jubbaland States in July 2017, both states\nhave launched their respective District Council formation processes. It is\nvital that these governance bodies have youth representation and address the\nneeds of young Somali men and women for these new institutions to be\nrepresentative and perceived as legitimate by their constituents. While other\ndonor funds are supporting stabilization and peacebuilding efforts at the community\nlevel, as well as the development of local government institutions and systems,\nthere is currently no intervention specifically promoting the inclusion of\nyoung men in women in state and peacebuilding processes in South West State and\nJubbaland. An investment of the Peacebuilding Fund to support such an\ninitiative is anticipated to have a dual catalytic effect by changing the\nattidudes of decision makers and their constituences in Kismayo, Baidoa and\nDollow in favor of youth inclusion and by improving the representativity of\ndistrict and state level governance structures. This expected outcome will have\na substantial impact of intergenerational relations, enabling young men and\nwomen to become key agents of change in the peace and statebuilding processes\nof Jubbaland and South West States. This proposal directly supports the\noutcomes of the current Peacebuilding Priority Plan for Somalia (2016-19) which\naims to strengthen the demand for and offer of good governance \u2013 rebuilding the\nsocial contract between Somali citizens and the Somali State. The proposed\nintervention therefore also directly contributes to the implementation of the\nFederal Government of Somalia\u2019s Wadajir Framework for Local Governance and to\nits Stabilization Strategy. The Youth\nPolitical Empowerment Programme\naims to provide young people and youth-led organisations, particularly young\nwomen\u2019s organisations, in Baidoa, Dollow and Kismayo with the tools and\nopportunities to meaningfully engage in decision-making, including the\nconstitutional review process as well as state-building and reconciliation\nefforts at the district level. The programme supports\nthe implementation of UNSC Resolution\n2250 (2015), which recognises the important and positive contribution of\nyouth to the promotion and maintenance of peace and security. The proposed\nintervention will enable marginalized youth in Somalia to engage in\nstate and peacebuilding efforts at the local and federal levels. This directly\nsupports the implementation of the UN Youth Strategy Principles which has\nidentified the political participation, empowerment, leadership,\nprotection of youth human rights, inter-generational collaboration as\npriorities. The programme also supports the ongoing efforts\nto develop a National Youth Policy for Somalia. The proposed intervention is\nalso aligned with the Federal Government of Somalia\u2019s National Development Plan\nwhich mainstreams youth as a cross-cutting issue throughout the nations\npriorities in order to contribute towards stability, economic prosperity and\nnational cohesion. The difficult security and\npolitical context in Somlia, calls for innovative ways to reach-out, engage,\nand mobilize youth.Therefore, the programme will facilitate the use of\ninnovative communication platforms including social media (Facebook, Twitter,\netc), radio podcasts, and web TV, to reach out to youth creating a channel for\nyoung women and men to express their visions for the future of Somalia. By\namplifying young people\u2019s voices, the programme will promote the exchange of ideas\namong peers and communities at large, challenging negative perceptions and\nfostering an intergenerational dialogue and trust. In view of the specific\nneeds of young women identified above, the programme will adopt a gender\nresponsive approach, mainstreaming gender issues in all activities and ensuring\nequal access to benefits for both women and men of the different age groups.\nThe programme will particularly ensure the participation of young women, as\nthey traditionally suffer double discrimination (age and gender). Based on a\nrealistic assessment of the Somali context and the challenges faced by Somali\nwomen, all capacity building workshops and councils will aim to have at least\n40% young women beneficiaries. After assessing the needs of young women\u2019s organizations,\nthe programme decided to employ a gender mixed approach to the different\ninitiatives, bringing young women and men together, enabling a collaborative\napproach, while sensitizing young men in the process.The programme will also provide\ntraining and strengthen the institutional capacity of the local administrations\nin Baidoa, Dollow and Kismayo to respond to the needs of young women and men.\nBy employing an area based approach to improve coordination amongst all levels\nof government. The programme provides a catalytic\nopportunity to build on recent peace and state-building gains and builds on\nrecommendations from the Security Council Resolution 2250 on youth, peace and\nsecurity and the National Youth Conference held in 2015, which identified the\nneed for dialogue platforms at the local and regional levels.The programme proposal was\ndeveloped in close consultation with Y-Peer Network, and other local youth\norganisations in the target areas. Prior to implementation, further\nmobilization of young women and youth organizations will take place. In August\n2017, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports employed their national radio\nprogramme \u201cAsk Your Friend\u201d to hold consultations with young women and men.\nOver 450 young people engaged through radio call-ins and emails. The findings\nfrom the radio survey highlighted that 55% of respondents emphasized there is a\ndire need for youth to meaningfully engage in peacebuilding. They also raised\nthe need for more efforts to minimize or respond to clan disputes, tackle\nillegal migration and prevent violent extremism. Moreover, 30% of the\nrespondents, underscored that youth-led community action should be prioritized\nwhile 15% of the respondents underscored the need for increased youth\nparticipation in political and governance decision-making processes.",

        "description": "UNDP and UN-Habitat are cooperating in the UN Joint Programme for Youth Employment, which \u2013 since its inception in October 2015 - has provided training and work opportunities to over 6,000 young women and men. This Action will build upon the successful model created, greatly contributing to and enhancing realistic livelihood opportunities for youth, with a strengthened focus on IDPs and returnees. This Action will significantly build on this work in the following ways:\u2022\tProviding youth in the targeted IDP communities with mentorship and entrepreneurship training;\u2022\tProviding safe spaces for IDP youth to learn and acquire the necessary skills to access the labour market for sectors that are immediately remunerative;\u2022\tEnabling IDPs to become more competitive in the lucrative sectors of the labour market.UNHCR has established a capacity building curriculum under the Protection Cluster focusing on protection and durable solutions for displaced populations, international humanitarian law, housing, land and property rights protection, including protection against forced evictions, as well as humanitarian negotiations. This Action will utilise the capacity building curriculum in the following ways:\u2022\tProviding eviction guidelines to authorities and law enforcement sectors explaining lawful evictions processes and their implementation;\u2022\tTraining of authorities on the protection of IDPs, durable solutions and protection of housing, land and property rights for IDPs and other vulnerable groups, notably against force evictions;\u2022\tConduct advocacy campaigns on IDP specific protection and durable solution-related challenges in the Mogadishu context.UNDP and UN-Habitat have been working on the Joint Programme for Local Governance (JPLG) since 2008. The Programme has facilitated strong, dynamic and organic links with government and non-state actors. UNDP and UN-Habitat\u2019s efforts in strengthening local governance will be replicated in this Action by:\u2022\tProviding capacity building training to the municipality which aims to create knowledge surrounding standards and systems necessary to support social protection programmes such as rental subsidy, low-cost housing, and relocation of IDPs;\u2022\tFormulating by-laws at the local municipal level.Potential Synergies(Please refer to the potential synergy table on the attached prodoc.)In September 2015, the Somalia Protection Cluster supported by UN-Habitat and UNHCR held the first ever Housing, Land and Property forum in Mogadishu bringing together Federal authorities, the municipality, UN and NGOs as well as donors to deliberate on more sustainable approaches to address forced evictions and support urban durable solutions. The outcomes of this forum and the relevant follow up processes also inform this proposal. Future Housing, Land and Property fora will further be used to support this Action.In December 2015, the DSRSG/RC/HC for Somalia launched the Somalia IDP Solutions Initiative advocated for by the Somalia Protection Cluster and supported by the three agencies participating in this joint action. This initiative was borne out of the need to urgently address the deteriorating situation of the IDPs and find durable solutions to protracted displacements. The Initiative seeks \u201cto complement still needed humanitarian assistance with development interventions to reverse the trend of protracted displacement and substantially reduce the number of IDPs in such displacement by facilitating and supporting durable solutions that bring them back into mainstream life and address underlying causes of their displacement and its protractedness.\u201d This initiative is led by the Federal Government of Somalia represented by H.E. Mohamed Arteh, Deputy Prime Minister, and the DSRSG/RC/HC. This action will actively and directly contribute towards the IDP Solutions Initiative",

If urbanization is the engine that propels the world towards prosperity in the 21st century then youth are the engineers. There are more people under the age of 25 today than ever, totaling over three billion or almost half of the total global population; 1.8 billion of that total are between the age of 12 and 24. These youth live, by and large, in cities and towns; the cities of the developing world account for over 90% of the world\u2019s urban growth and youth account for a large percentage of those inhabitants. It is estimated that as many as 60% of all urban dwellers will be under the age of 18 by 2030.",

        "title": "Achieving Local Solutions To Displacement Crises In Somalia: A Human Security Approach To Durable Solutions",
        "description": "Human\nmobility should be considered in conjunction with the spatial repercussions\nthat population movements have on the locations affected by displacement. Over\nthe course of more than two decades of conflict, access to land, security of\ntenure and more broadly settlement\nhave become central issues affecting Somalia\u2019s security and stability going\nforwards; influencing the country\u2019s trajectory towards recovery and development\nin future; and ultimately playing a key role in establishing the foundations\nfor human security for displaced populations, returnees, other mobile groups\nand their hosts. \n\n\n\nIssues\nrelated to land tenure in Somalia are inextricably linked to voluntary and\nforced migration. Land is central to many different economic, social, cultural,\nenvironmental and political goals, making tenure security vital for peace and\nstability. Yet, land becomes a conflict driver when forms of dispossession take\nplace, or when rights to land use, access and transferability are violated. Any\ndisruptive or forcefully imposed change in how groups and individuals connect\nwith their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia did -\nresult in forms of organised violence. Conflict, natural disasters or rapid\nsocial and economic transformations (e.g. state formation, industrialization\nand urbanisation) trigger migrations that separate populations from their\nbelongings, assets, livelihoods and the cultural landmarks they identify with.\nHaving in place fair mechanisms to protect formal and customary rights to\naccess, use and transferability of land and regulate land use and allocation is\nessential to prevent outbreaks of conflict and violence.\n\n\n\nRegarding movements\nand dispossessions produced by conflict and natural disasters, in Somalia the\nnumber of internally displaced has almost tripled over the past ten years. The\nurban dimension of internal displacement is evident and corroborated by the\ntrends in rural to urban migration which has, over the past ten years, averaged\nrates of 4.1-4.5%. The relevance of cities in strengthening security,\nresponding to large population influxes and consolidating peace dividends is\nunquestionable. Yet, city expansion in major urban centres in Somalia is\nlargely unplanned and unregulated and land is arbitrarily redistributed.\nIncreased commercial interests have triggered large-scale investments, as well\nas construction works for commercial and residential structures. However, the\ntrickle-down effect of this renewed commercial interest is extremely limited.\nVulnerable populations hardly ever are in the position to harness the benefits\nof this rapid transformation. Displaced persons, returnees urban dwellers and\nurban poor are caught in a negative feedback loop, whereby the lack of\nregulation, good governance and law enforcement, exacerbates insecure access to\nland, exposure to violent land disputes and forcible eviction, as well as\nexclusion from public service delivery. This vulnerability and marginalization\ncontributes to pervasive fragility and conflict, In sum, nascent formal\ninstitutions are unequipped to equitably re-establish tenure units, and\ncustomary rights are often arbitrary and not accessible to \u201cidentity-defined\u201d\nstrangers - this would be the case of returnees and migrants who cannot access,\ncontrol and transfer land customary rights on the same grounds as local\ncommunities.\n\n\n\nThe recent\nannouncement by the government of Kenya expressing intention to repatriate\nSomali refugees has raised the already prominent issue to a critical level in\nsome areas. In the absence of a well-established legislative framework and law\nenforcement procedures for land, context appropriate, consensus based, and\nequitable solutions to land remain key establishing foundations for sustainable\nrecovery and stability. Conversely, the failure to address land issues,\nsecurity of tenure and sustainable housing could result in instability,\nconflict and the destitution of affected groups. \n\n\n\nThe multidimensional\naspect of community driven responses to instability and conflict mitigation\nrelated to mobility and housing, land and property as well as urban planning\nrequires a multi-agency approach, through which each agency will capitalize on\nits own experience and expertise. The International Organization for Migration\n(IOM) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) have the\nexpertise and mandates to support these locally owned processes in addressing\nmobility/displacement and space/urban planning. IOM, as the leading agency on\nmobility and migration, will utilize its experience in supporting community\ndriven approaches to respond to drivers of displacement and mitigate disputes\nrelated to mobility and movements, while UN-HABITAT, as the leading agency for\nurban planning and addressing issues related to space, including land, will\nemploy its expertise in supporting locally driven approaches to promote\nparticipatory urban planning, participatory settlement upgrading, resolve land disputes and map conflicts and\ndispute resolution mechanisms related to housing, land and property.\n\n\n\nGiven the scale of\nSomalia\u2019s population movements summarized above, geographic targeting through a\nfirst phase of support needs to be carefully considered and the following\ncriteria are used to prioritize targeting for this project. Firstly, areas\nimpacted by the return of Somalis from Dadaab refugee camp are prioritized for\nthis intervention. Whilst the number of IDPs by far exceeds the number of those\nreturning from Dadaab, the former are living in protracted situations of\ndisplacement and the latter will return over a short space of time. This\njustification is therefore based on the time critical impact that returns will\nhave in existing fragile contexts and the accompanying need to provide support\nat social, infrastructural and legislative levels. The second criterion is to\ntarget those areas highly impacted by internal displacement particularly those\nnot currently covered by existing interventions. When combined with the first\ntargeting, of areas being impacted by return, the following areas become an\nobvious priority. \n\n\n\n\n \n  \n  Location\n  \n  \n  Estimated IDP population\n  \n  \n  Estimated No. of returns based on intention\n  surveys[1]\n  \n  \n  Returnees from Dadaab to date\n  \n \n \n  \n  Kismayo\n  \n  \n  57,240[2] \n  \n  \n  39,723\n  \n  \n  4,873\n  \n \n \n  \n  Afmadow\n  \n  \n  54,984[3]\n  \n  \n  \n  2,085\n  \n  \n  1,347\n  \n \n \n  \n  Garbaharey\n  \n  \n  3,325\n  \n  \n  58\n  \n  \n  133\n  \n \n \n  \n  Baardheere\n  \n  \n  18,000\n  \n  \n  1,600\n  \n  \n  2,005\n  \n \n \n  \n  Bu\u2019ale\n  \n  \n  12,000\n  \n  \n  3,966\n  \n  \n  1,536\n  \n \n \n  \n  Sakow\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  2,181\n  \n  \n  2,004\n  \n \n \n  \n  Jamame\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  193\n  \n  \n  764\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nFor the funding from\nthe Human Security Trust Fund, the interventions will focus on Kismayo and\nAfmadow, while additional co-funding from other sources (Peacebuilding Fund,\netc.) will focus on other locations within Jubaland. Members of the joint\nprogramme currently have either an existing operational footprint or will\nexpand to these locations in the coming months which also supports the\nfeasibility of supporting interventions there.\nFurthermore, all of the above referenced locations have been identified as\npriority by the Federal Government Ministry of Interior and are therefore in\nline with government\u2019s current focus for the types of interventions proposed.",

This organisation has already opened eight schools and runs four literacy campaigns, but the difficulties of recruiting and retaining teachers are immense. There are very few trained teachers from the area, and teachers brought in from elsewhere tend to stay for only short periods, and are exclusively male. There is a severe shortage of trained teachers in Somalia, and very few women have had the opportunity to train up to a professional standard. This particular project provides teacher training through a two year certificate course run by a local university but based in schools. This means female student teachers can live at home, making accessing the training easier. Because they are drawn from the local area, they are less likely to leave the region.

        "title": "Sustainable Access to clean Water,Hygiene and Sanitation to droughts affected communities in Sanaag and Sool region",
        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

        "description": "This project is designed to provide emergency and lifesaving nutrition services to 21984 vulnerable persons (3936 men, 5204 women, 5474 boys and 7370 girls) living in Balcad, cadale and Mahaday districts of Middle Shabelle. The intervention will target pregnant and lactating women (PLW) together with children under the age of 5 years (CU5) amongst the host communities, IDPs and returnees in the Balcad district where Wocca is the primary rationalized partner in Adale where we are the secondary rationalized partner and also extend our services to Mahaday.  Wocca will operate 2 fixed/static outpatient therapeutic feeding centers (fixed OTPs) and 4 mobile outpatient therapeutic feeding programme teams (mobile OTPs) targeting 16 locations chosen on the basis of vulnerability and absence of nutrition interventions in the 3 districts. The static facilities will be established in Ceelow and Caddow Uul locations  and Cadale districts respectively while the 4 outreach teams will serve 14 locations namely Bulo Axmed Cigow, Kulmis Weyn, Buurfuule and Xudur Ciise in Mahaday Ceelka Cusub, Cisiley and Sheikh Rooble Garas weyne, Cadan gabey and Ceel Xamar in Cadale Xanlay, Muki dheere Bari, Bulo Walaal and Caro faag in Balcad. WOCCA has engaged UNICEF for backstopping during training of the project staff, community health workers (CHWs) and mothers for the \u201cmothers MUAC approach\u201d, on nutrition screening and case identification, Integrated management of acute malnutrition(IMAM),Infant and young child feeding education (IYCF-E) and Nutrition, health and hygiene promotion (NHHP).The trained staff shall be deployed to the targeted locations, mobile and static OTPs where together with the trained mothers will screen children under 5 and PLWs. Children under 5 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) conditions and no medical complications will be enrolled to the static and mobile OTPs for treatment while the cases with medical complications will be referred by the mobile clinics and CHWs to the stabilization center (SC) in Waberi star village managed by WOCCA for nutrition and medical rehabilitation. Children under 5 and PLWs with MAM conditions will be referred to TSFP center managed by ARC. CHWs and Hygiene promoters will be trained on Nutrition, Health and Hygiene Promotion (NHHP), they will disseminate hygiene promotion messages to the communities to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera during the activities as they move around with the mobile Team. Mothers will be counseled individually and in groups by trained nutrition staff and Community Health Workers (CHWs) on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. The project will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MNPs) and Vitamin A supplements to pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of 5years through the static and mobile facilities. UNICEF has been supporting WOCCA with nutrition supplies and technical guidance on previous nutrition projects within the targeted locations and currently supporting our SHF funded project running in Daynille/Kaxda IDP camps and in Balcad district. Therefore, in this project WOCCA will still engage UNICEF to provide nutrition supplies and technical support for management of SAM cases. To enhance effective coordination, WOCCA will provide monthly activity updates with partners including Nutrition cluster both regional and Nairobi level, Other agencies working in the field who are doing other sector projects in the project sites will also be updated to avoid duplication and promote effective and efficient utilization humanitarian fund.",

Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Cares Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results show\n that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health care\n for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that \neventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneousl\ny invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the \ntelephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue.

The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

        "title": "Fighting TB in Somalia: public-private partnerships and inclusive communities",
        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB)  especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: d\nisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat  fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is th\ne low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case detect\nion rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and prisone\nrs)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of Soma\nliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of tu\nberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease stigm\na/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tubercul\nosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

Although there have been improvements to the peace and security situation in Somalia since the formation of the Federal Government of Somalia in 2012, the overall situation remains fragile with Al-Shabab a major obstacle to peace and security. Forced displacement remains an ongoing a reality for people living in Somalia due to armed conflict, environmental hardships due to climate change, combined with inadequate resource distribution that is often exacerbated by clan based, ideological differences and land and natural resources competition. The COVID-19 pandemic has added yet another hazard that people in Somalia face. While it has now been over a year since the first case was detected in Somalia and efforts have been made to mitigate the risk, the situation is always evolving. With the main objective to ensure dignified, safe and secure living conditions and basic services for vulnerable populations affected by conflict and disasters in Somalia, IOM proposes an integrated camp coordination and camp management, Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and shelter and non-food item emergency support.",

Zu diesem Zweck soll ein Insider-Netzwerk von engagierten Personen aus der Zivilgesellschaft gegr\u00fcndet und bef\u00e4higt werden, Mediation, Dialog und andere friedensrelevante Arbeiten vor Ort durchzuf\u00fchren. Zudem werden Workshops mit Akteuren der regionalen Verwaltung abgehalten, um ihr Bewusstsein f\u00fcr Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Frieden und Konflikten sowie Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf Konflikte zu sch\u00e4rfen und ihre F\u00e4higkeit zur Reaktion auf Konflikte auszubauen. Weiterhin werden in verschiedenen Distrikten Galmudugs gro\u00dfe Versammlungen im Rahmen des Gemeindedialogs organisiert, auf denen die Gemeindemitglieder lokale Konflikte und andere einschl\u00e4gige Fragen er\u00f6rtern und gemeinsam L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr diese Konflikte entwickeln k\u00f6nnen. Es wird 1-2 Mal im Monat ein regionales Radioprogramm produziert, in dem Friedens- und Konfliktthemen in verschiedenen Formaten diskutiert werden und an dem Zuh\u00f6rer aktiv teilnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Schlie\u00dflich werden die Anerkennung der Klimakrise und ihrer Auswirkungen auf Konflikt und Frieden sowie die Unterst\u00fctzung bei der Entwicklung von Ideen, wie die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels angegangen/reduziert werden k\u00f6nnen, in alle Projektaktivit\u00e4ten einbezogen.",

The project will seek to improve the retention of already enrolled children living in flood-affected areas into the quality and inclusive basic education in a safe and protective learning environment. \n\nThe project will target and support 8,750 children (40% girls) in 20 schools, the most affected schools will be selected in coordination with regional coordinators will receive light rehabilitation and furnishing of desks and chairs, provision of teaching and learning materials to 8,750 learners from 20 schools, provision of dignity kits to 2000 adolescent girls to enhance their daily school attendance, provision of recreational materials to 20 schools that are tailored to the needs of children, Provision of community-based psychosocial support in schools, the establishment of 20 temporary child-friendly spaces (CFS) that will support the provision of PSS, recreational activities and non-formal education activities. On the protection front, the project will identify specific protection needs, inform service provision and serve as an entry point for specialized service provision with boys and girls. Targeted psychosocial support, psychological first aid, case management, and emergency referrals will be provided to child survivors of rights violations, Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC), and children who show signs of trauma. 500 children will be targeted for IDTR and PSS provided, of which 30% expected to be reunified with their families. \n\nThe proposed intervention will create synergies with existing programs focusing on child protection. The caseworkers and monitors in the present proposal will act as a reference for the referral pathways aiming at connecting services in the communities. Before starting the implementation, HIWA will coordinate with Shelter, protection, WASH, and CCCM to ensure complementarity and reinforcement of the project approach. HIWA has a strong experience in child protection in emergency and in resilience context and has previously implemented child protection programs funded by UNICEF in Beletweyne and Buula Burte, through this experience HIWA has established linkages with community leaders, local authorities and camp leaders making access and acceptance easier in the target locations. HIWA will coordinate with the regional education cluster during the implementation of the project. Coordination with WASH cluster will be essential in implementing the project, HIWA will work closely with Wash partner who will carry out hygiene promotion in schools and also ensure the water sources in the schools are safe.\n\nOpportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration within and beyond the HIWA education and protection sectors will be sought. The collaboration will include emergency operations with cluster partners to ensure a comprehensive approach and view of education and child protection. HIWA will use the strength of its relationship with the regional education and protection clusters to share information and collaborate in service provision to avoid duplication of activities in the selected schools. Before implementation starts, HIWA will liaise with the regional coordination structure to identify schools that have not been targeted by other partners. HIWA will also closely work with Relief International and Qatar foundation on hygiene promotion and other WASH interventions. Referrals will be directed to them where WASH needs are identified in different schools.",

At least 17 people have died, including 2 children.Belet Weyne district in Hiraan region is worst affected with 231,000 people displaced from their homes. Another 55,000 people have been displaced in Jubaland while heavy rains have affected 30,000 people, many of them women and children. Farmland and infrastructure have been destroyed and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. The floods have worsened an already complex and prolonged humanitarian situation created by cyclic natural disasters ranging from floods, drought and floods and conflict.\nThe proposed project plans to provide immediate lifesaving health services to populations in Jalalaqsi and B/weyne who have batling with floods that have lead to death, displacement and destruction. Four health centres one per District and four mobile health units attached to the health centers will be scaled up by RRP to deliver basic healthcare more so to mothers and children who have been disproportionately affected by the floods. The project will target 8,500 beneficiaries (5,000 in Beletweyne and 3,500 in Jalalaqsi). It will increase the availability of emergency obstetric care services and increase access to these services for vulnerable populations. Mobile health teams will be utilised to expand coverage and link hard to reach villages affected by the floods to mainstream healthcare services.\nThe project will deliver lifesaving emergency health services including maternal, neonatal and child health through 4 maternal homes/static and 4 outreaches mobile health facilities in flood affected districts of Beletweyne and Jalalaqsi of Hiran Region. Trained staff will provide maternal health services to 5000 and 3500 affected mothers in Beletweyne and Jalalaqsi districts respectively emphasis will be focused on provision of quality services. Emphasis will be laid on Maternal and Child Health, including Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) and referral services for Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) to the most vulnerable flood affected communities in these two districts. Attention will be paid on application of maternal service delivery guidelines as per EPHS at the PHC. Qualified trained health workers will offer ANC and BEmONC. This service delivery will be offered by a cadre of competent staff consisting of 1 doctor based in Beletweyne, 3 mid wives(2 in beletweyne and 1 in Jalalaqsi), 4 assistant mid-wives (2 in beletweyne and 2 in Jalalaqsi), 23 social mobilizers (12 in beletweyne and 11 in Jalalaqsi), a pharmacist and a lab technician. \nSocial mobilizers who will be in beletweyne will cover Hawa tako, Kooshin  to the eastern side of the river and Buundo weyne, Howl Wadaag to the Western side of the river Shabelle.

        "description": "The rains that have inundated parts of Somalia are expected to continue in November with moderate to heavy intensity, according to the FAO Managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM). Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency lifesaving integrated health and nutrition services to the floods affected population in Berdale by establishing four mobile clinics and fixed facility supported by a network of community volunteers. \n\nHEALTH: The proposed project will support 4 Mobile Clinics and one fixed facility in Berdale district with the aim to deliver an integrated package of promotive, preventive and curative services through facility-based and community-based care. Specifically, general consultations, ANC/PNC/Delivery and basic life-saving treatment for those who suffer from common diseases such as AWD/ Cholera, malaria, respiratory tract infections, Routine immunization for children and pregnant mothers. The Mobile Clinics will work with a network of community volunteers in IDPs and host community to improve community sensitization and referral of severe cases and pregnant mothers to the MCH for safe delivery and neonatal care. The CVs/clinical staffs will be provided CP/GBV mainstreaming training to strengthen the referral cases of GBV survivors and clinical management in coordinating with the protection team for Psycho-social Support (PSS) and case management.   \n\nNUTRITION: The proposed  activities will be integrated with the health interventions with an aim to address the underlying causes of high levels malnutrition as well as to enable early identification for screening in targeted IDPs for floods affected population in Berdale district. This program will establish a strong community network through competent CNVs for early detection and referral of children, PLWs with acute malnutrition for active ongoing nutrition services provided by other partners. IYCF counseling will be provided at community in outreach and facility level for effective mobilization on the optimal nutritional feeding to under five children.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, it will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n\nThrough this project, a total of 40,000 (35,000 IDPs and 5,000 Host communities) floods affected individuals in Berdale will have access to a package of Emergency lifesaving integrated health with nutrition services in six months period. The BLS ambulances will provide referral services from IDPs to the fixed facility (MCH) to improve access to the integrated package for the vulnerable community prioritizing to rapidly refer the critical cases (priority will be given to under 5 children and pregnant women). It is estimated to provide BLS services to over 300 critical/emergency medical cases. The project will establish an efficient outreach and referral mechanism from community based to primary healthcare amp for primary to secondary health services through a network of CVs and through the BLS capacity of the Mobile Clinics vehicles for patient transportation.",

        "description": "Limited access to safe water in Somaliland is endemic and is worsening with prolonged drought. Poor, below-average rainfall in northern and central Somalia during the Deyr season of 2018 has resulted in a harsher than normal dry season. \nMost water sources across Sool and Sanaag regions in the north are not suitable for human consumption and approximately half of the birkads are damaged, and a quarter of them did not harvest any run-off because of the lack of rains. In addition, poor access to latrines leads to prevalent open defecation across Somalia/land. \nThe aim of the proposed project is to provide lifesaving support to and rebuild resilience of affected communities through providing sustainable solutions to water access. Oxfam prioritizes activities that enable communities to access continued water supply from existing groundwater sources, reduce the walking distance for women/girls to fetch water at a reduced cost, contain human feaces contaminating the environment and surface water sources, and promote behavioural change on personal hygiene and handwashing at critical times.\nOxfam is present in hard-to-reach and in some of the most neglected geographical areas of Sool and Sanaag regions and continues to prioritize presence based on where the highest \u2018unreached\u2019 needs lie. There is a committed and robust humanitarian team (over 30+) in Somalia based out of a main office, a field office, and two sub-offices. The current team has strong technical capacity in response management, with technical coordinators for WaSH and a robust 3-person MEAL team that guides quality and accountability of programming in the field. Working with partners on some interventions/responses, also affords good complementarity in understanding the local context and assuring 2-way sharing of technical knowledge and skills that could enrich growth and progress in addressing the needs of the target population. \n\n2 desalination units are proposed in Oog and Garadag. Oxfam will engage in a public private partnership with Boreal Light (which has expertise in operating desalination plants and can provide operation and management training) and the Somaliland Ministry of Water Resource Development (MoWRD). Oxfam already has good relationships and experience with both parties, having closely collaborated around 2 existing desalination units funded in other areas by other donors. The MoWRD supports and endorses desalination work in Somaliland. \n\nBoreal Light is a leading actor in this sector, specialized in renewable energy solutions for water treatment facilities. It manufactures affordable solar water desalination systems and has extensive expertise in the region, including Kenya and Somaliland. It has identified a local agent in Somaliland who will be responsible for operating, maintaining and managing the desalination units under the SHF project for a period 12 months. The training provided in this time will present a sustainable model after the end of the project period. \n\nTo ensure value for money for this funding and program complimentary, ACTED and Oxfam will coordinate on key activities in Sanaag. At project inception, there will be a training workshop on key learning from WASH programming in the region to share experience: e.g. borehole drilling, sharing supplier lists and good practices in drilling and rehabilitation works, engagement with communities and local authorities. Other topics are likely to cover hydreological surveys, desalination and solarization. WASHCO training to be jointly undertaken after asset completion. Cost savings will be on printing materials, vehicle, and stationary. Joint mapping of WASH facilities in El-Afweyn and Ainabo to assess status of available assets, beneficiaries reached and to analyze gaps and investments necessary to provide support. .A joint MampE exercise will be done twice in the project period.",

The SHF activities will complement the CERF emergency health and nutrition activities in the selected locations. The proposed project will also complement DRC's drought-targeted Integrated Emergency Responses in Somalia funded by OFDA. This will enable DRC to provide a complete assistance package to the drought affected communities in selected locations in the North-Western part of Somaliland. The region selected is Awdal which is the most affected region in the north by drought and the Tripical Cyclone Sagar in June 2018, causing displacement and also affecting the strategic water points that communities rely on during the dry spells. Therefore, the WASH assistance package will include - rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures construction of new water infrastructures equipping of boreholes with a hybrid pumping system (solar and generator) and distribution networks establishment of water committee to manage water points and ensure their sustainability. Where appropriate, DRC will partner with private borehole owners to supply water to catchment population and sign a tripartite MOU among the private borehole owner, DRC and Local Authorities. Where there are pressing needs especially in crowded IDP camps and among very vulnerable households, DRC will provide household-shared desludgable latrines. The latrines shall be shared among four (4) households. They shall be installed with hand-wash facility, a ramp to allow for easy access for PLDs especially the ones using a wheelchair and shall be installed with a door lockable from inside to ensure women feel secure while using them. DRC is equally piloting sanitation marketing in the south (Dollow and Baidoa), and will apply lessons learnt from these locations to this project. Overall, with rehabilitation of 5 boreholes,construction of 8 elevated tanks and installation of  portable water tanks DRC targets to reach 59,230 people of which 13623 men, 15400 women, 15400 boys and 14807 girls. This population includes 30% IDPs, 60% host community and 10% returnees. The other groups targeted include people affected by cyclone in Awdal considered the coastal population. With 200 desludgable latrines installed with hand wash facilities and sanitation kits, DRC will also reach 4800 people (1104 men, 1248 women, 1248 boys and 1200 girls) with sustainable access to adequate sanitation facilities.",

        "description": "This project aims at providing reliable and sustained access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities to target population residing in nine riverine villages in Jowhar district that are facing water shortages and have limited access to sanitation facilities. The target population was heavily affected by floods that occurred in 2018 where water supply infrastructures and sanitation facilities were severely damaged and are yet to be repaired. Poor rainfall received during the 2018 Deyr season and the ongoing dry conditions has resulted in critical water shortages and a rapid decline in the remaining water reservoirs in Jowhar district. The river Shabelle that is the main source of water and a vital source of livelihood for communities residing along the river has dried up once again in now four consecutive years.\n\nIn this context, WOCCA will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aimed at providing sustained access to safe water through the rehabilitation of 22 strategic wells and fitted with hand pumps. To reduce pressure on the few functioning wells 2 shallow wells will be constructed in Bardheere and Nuukay village. A water distribution system that will include pipeline extension, overhead tank and water kiosk with 8taps and a solar pumping system will be installed in Nuukay village so that more people including neighboring pastoral communities can benefit from the water since the well has a good yield. In Gashaanle village rehabilitation of a shallow well, water tank, kiosk, and installation of a solar pumping system will be done. Identification of these targeted locations for construction and rehabilitation was done in consultation with the community elders and the local authority. The water sources will be located 30m away from latrines to avoid contamination. Dewatering of the rehabilitated/constructed shallow wells and application of shock chlorination will be done to ensure that the water is safe for consumption. \n\nTo strengthen community ownership and ensure sustainability of WASH assets 130 Water management committee members (at least 40% of women) will be trained on operation, maintenance and safe water storage. The project staff and WMC members will be trained on DRR and protection mainstreaming. 310 gender-sensitive latrines with hand-washing facilities, raised to avoid flooding and fitted with locks from the inside to curb GBV will be constructed in the targeted villages. Women, girls and vulnerable groups will be consulted in siting and design of the WASH infrastructures to maximize safety, privacy and dignity. To ensure the WASH infrastructures endure future floods, WOCCA will incorporate DRR aspects in the design of the WASH infrastructures. Sensitization meetings will be held at the inception of the project with all project stakeholders including groups at risk of exclusion to inform them about the project objectives, scope, beneficiary selection criteria, and beneficiary entitlement and roles. Accountability to the affected population will be enhanced through the provision of a feedback hotline to beneficiaries where they can provide feedback and complaints. To ensure quality in the project outputs the project staff will continuously monitor and report on project indicators. WOCCA will also share GPS coordinates of all WASH structures and monthly project reports with the WASH cluster and donor. Signing off and handing over of WASH structures to beneficiaries upon completion will be done through community elders, government officials and religious leaders. WOCCA will also adhere to the principles of \"Do no harm\" through not creating any partial, nepotism, conflict-oriented and sensitive issues within the project beneficiaries.",

        "description": "The proposed project will improve access to sustainable water and sanitation services for17500 drought/AWD affected communities (2625 men,  4375 women,  5250 girls and 5250 boys) IDPs and poor host communities in Qansaxdhera district in Bay region, through rehabilitation of two boreholes, upgrading/rehabilitation of 11 shallow wells, construction of 102 flood proof latrines. Hygiene promotion activities will be complemented with our ongoing IERT project in Bay region. SAMA rapid assessment conducted between 5-6 March 2019 indicated that more than 75% of affected population can't afford the cost of water due to increased price of water exposing thousands of households to walk more than 30 minutes for water collection and become exposed and risk for gender-based violence. 80% of water infrastructure (wells) need are open source and expose to contamination which is risk of AWD diseases. to Takcle this , SAMA proposes sustainable solution to improve access to safe  water and sanitation services for the affected people in line with Somali WASH cluster response plan  : \n1. Water :  Provision of sustained access to safe drinking water to 17500 drought/AWD affected communities (2625 men,  4375 women,  5250 girls and 5250 boys) IDPs and poor host communities in Qansaxdhera district in Bay region, through rehabilitation of two boreholes equipped with hybrid and supplied water to two kiosks through piping system to two kiosks.  Upgrading /rehabilitation of of 11 shallow wells with hand pumps. To ensure the sustainability and the management of water facilities SAMA will enhance the capacity of WASH committees to keep the maintenance and operation of the water source after the project is faced out. \n2. Sanitation : SAMA will Increase access to sanitation facilities to the population affected by drought and AWD/cholera diseases through construction of 102 gender separated, flood proof latrines with lockable doors and hand washing facilities benefiting  affected people including women, men, girls and boys. SAMA will ensure the maintenance and the appropriate use of sanitation facilities in close coordination and collaboration with IDPs mainly camp committees (men and women). \n3. Adoption of good sanitation and promotion of public health : Sanitation/hygiene promotion activities will be complemented with our ongoing IERT poject in Bay region. 25 community health workers are carrying out comprehensive sanitation promotion through conducting cleaning up campaigns at 5 big IDP camps, awareness campaign to promote the adaption of good hygiene and sanitation practices to affected men, women and children.\nSAMA will ensure both quantity and quality of water (safety) for the affected population. No bacterial contamination and facilities remain functional in case of flooding.",

        "description": "As Water shortage and poor access to water currently remains the single biggest threat to lives of IDP\u2019s and vulnerable host communities in Hobyo and Galkacyo districts. Humanitarian needs have increased drastically due to below-average Deyr rain in 2018, large-scale displacement and lack of access to basic services. There are no permanent water sources within the IDP settlements hence IDPs rely on berkards which have since dried up, and there is high pressure on the few existing boreholes, already suffering years of neglect and poor maintenance in Hobyo and Galkacyo districts. Pastoralists are highly vulnerable because they are dependent upon rain-fed rangeland grazing for their livestock and tend to have very few fixed assets. The project intends to provide durable and sustainable water and sanitation services to 22,705 IDP\u2019s and drought vulnerable people in Afgaduudle, Madaxdaran, Lascadalle, Tarogee, Qaidaro and Wisil villages by drilling 3 boreholes and rehabilitation of 3 strategic boreholes to provide sufficient safe water increasing access to at least 15 litters per day. The boreholes will be piped within a radius of 1150 meters. The project will also construct 60 latrines to improve sanitation conditions. Construction amp rehabilitation of reliable water sources to the IDP\u2019s and vulnerable host communities will reduce distance and time spent collecting water thus contribute to reduction of AWD for children and GBV among women and girls. WASH committees will also be established/revived/streamlined and trained to strengthen their capacity to manage the operation and maintenance of the new and rehabilitated boreholes and promote good hygiene practices and sanitation within their communities. 60 participants (30% are women) from NGO\u2019s, government and private sector will be selected in mutual collaboration with National and Regional WASH cluster will be trained on diagnostics of ageing boreholes and methods of rehabilitation through 2 workshops in Galkacyo and Mogadishu.",

The overarching objective is to contribute towards enhancing protection response capacity, through the deployment of mobile teams composed of Case Workers, Case Manager, and field Monitors, for increased identification and service delivery.  This assistance will be provided where there is currently very limited access to GBV services and to provide tailored and effective assistance where it is needed most, HIWA will:\n\n1. Conduct Rapid Protection Assessments to identify the most urgent needs after new displacements.\n2. Provide specialized GBV case management to at-risk women and girls. The guiding strategy will be twofold: combining collection, analysis and dissemination of relevant information through community outreaches and direct support of identified cases through comprehensive case management (including case management for boy and girl survivors of GBV medical and psychosocial support and referral to other specialized care and ensuring appropriate follow up and care where necessary. \n3. Distribution of emergency material support through the distribution of dignity kits to women and girls and distribution of solar lantern and engagement with communities to build community-driven protection mechanisms\n4. Psychosocial support through temporary women and girls friendly spaces providing psychosocial support, recreational activities, and non-formal education activities. \n5. In close collaboration with the GBV sub-cluster (WARDI) in Beletweyne review and strengthening of local level referral pathways.\n6. Site Safety audits will be conducted to assess the flood impact and examine aspects pertaining to protection and safeguarding, to ensure the safety of men, women, boys, and girls, including people with disabilities.\n7. Community outreach and engagement activities to disseminate key information on GBV, including information on the availability of services, and promote positive social norms to improve the safety and well-being of women and girls\n\nThe project aims at reaching as many beneficiaries as possible offering them multilayer assistance and different service provided. The core of the proposal is the mobilization of caseworkers who will access different areas and reach newly displaced, as well as receiving community members. The teams will provide different services, from general protection (case management, psycho-social support services, provision of medical (CMR) services for survivors of rape, monitoring of protection issues and documentation of GBV cases management and referral). Target beneficiaries will include: women, men, girls and boys among displaced, including newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people receiving community members. The guiding strategy will be twofold: combining collection, analysis, and dissemination of relevant information and direct support of identified cases through comprehensive case management (including internal/external referral) and distribution of dignity kits.",

        "description": "Increased rainfall since the beginning of September in both Ethiopian highlands and within the catchments in Somalia has resulted in a sharp rise in the Shabelle and Juba rivers, leading to severe flooding in southern and central Somalia. According to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), the recent Shabelle river flooding displaced over 270,000 people, of whom 230,000 are in Beletweyne District. Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. According to the FAO-led Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the rains are projected to continue in the coming weeks and it is expected to end in early December. DRC proposes to undertake a life-saving and sustainable assistance to Flood- Displaced people in Beletweyne through provision of emergency shelter kits (ESK), non-food items (NFIs). DRC will target 2050 households (12,300 people) with ESK and NFIs. The standard emergency NFI package will include plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamp and Jerry cans. Where possible, DRC will give the NFIs through cash transfers or vouchers so that beneficiaries can decide based on their needs. DRC will also assist with a standard ESK that contains: Local available stick for vertical post (Philippian Tree) Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philippian Tree) or White wood (8cm x 4cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing or White wood (5cm x 2.5cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) at the base of roof truss or White wood (10cm x 2.5cm size each) Nails No. 5 (5 inch) Nails No. 6 (6 inch) Drum door with frame Hinges for door Local plastic sheet (size: 4m x 7m) and outer wall clothing Buul layer. This provides the most basic shelter which can offer protection from extreme weather. The ESK helps the displaced household to put up by a 4m x 4m shelter structure within the first few days of displacement. DRC is aware that the needs are huge and the available funding cannot cover everyone. DRC is also aware that families of affected persons are normally the first responders and therefore, some families may be better positioned to survive such disaster due to their own social networks. Therefore DRC will develop a selection criteria based on AGD as well as vulnerability to ensure that assistance goes to the ones who deserve it most. Female-headed households, families with many children and the aged (65+ year-olds) will be given priority. DRC will also ensure that, persons living with disabilities (PLDs) or families with such persons are also targeted with assistance.  Families considered extremely vulnerable, will be assisted by DRC to put up their shelter through cash paid after erection. DRC determines that this cash shall be 60 USD and targets 540 hhs out of 2050 hhs. DRC will undertake a post-distribution monitoring (PDM) study four (4) weeks after distribution to measure the effectiveness of distribution and also the satisfaction of the beneficiaries on the items distributed. This will help inform future programming in shelter, NFIs and CCCM programming. Specific to CCCM, DRC shall engage in installation of solar lights and in settlement maintenance including clearance of any solid waste and access roads. DRC will also, jointly with the camp/settlement committees undertake mapping of available services and establish a referral system. Through that, DRC will establish information boards at strategic points like social centers like water points and markets for people to have easy access to information. DRC will support community governance structures through trainings to ensure that camp/settlement committees can manage their daily issues in a structured manner. At sub-national level, DRC will ensure coordination of CCCM meetings happen and deliberations are reported.",

The nutrition cluster priority districts in Hiran region including Beletweyne due to critical levels of GAM rate at 19.6 and SAM of 4.1. The project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected populations. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project includes construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health, nutrition and WASH services through the support of static health facilities and mobile outreach to the flood affected populations in Hiran, particularly Beletweyne District. There will be 8 sites that will provide integrated health and nutrition services for flood affected communities, offering outpatient consultations, routine immunization, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTPs, TSFP, IYCF-E and referral to stabilization centers. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will also be provided. Special focus will be given to prevention of disease outbreak and malnutrition, improve early identification malnutrition by empowering mothers to use MUAC screening, access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThe WASH component in health and nutrition will also improve good hygiene practices, rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure, more equitable and better access to sustainable water points for drinking and handwashing with soap, and provision of basic sanitation services in these facilities. Hygiene and sanitation support and promotion will be provided in an integrated approach in the health and nutrition sites.

        "description": "Flood triggered displacement is on the rise in Middle Shebelle, with new areas engulfed by floods water during the wet season every day. The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

        "description": "The rains that have inundated parts of Somalia are expected to continue in November with moderate to heavy intensity, according to the FAO Managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM). Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

Also this project is working to rehabilitate WASH facilities damaged by the floods including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding. It will contribute to the reduction of emergency WASH gaps reported and works to improve the hygiene practices of the affected communities through kit distribution and awareness campaigns. \nThe project is for 6 months targeting a total beneficiary of 30,000 individuals living in Baldweyn. This reserve allocation will enable QC to scale up flood responses in Beledweyn and reach more beneficiaries in the coming months. \n1.\tThis Project will work to provide emergency water trucking through voucher to flood affected communities in Beledweyn. Currently, potential high-risk areas for the water trucking activities are areas where people are displaced to. A total of 2,500 households equivalent to 15,000 people will be supported  with water voucher for 3 months and each person will be provided 15 l/p/d (acceptable WASH cluster standards in Somalia), with total of 2,520 trucks.\nQC will also provide water to health/nutrition facilities and schools within the target communities. QC will competitively contract water vendors to supply households with agreed quantities over the specified period. Households provided with vouchers will access their allocation of water at the water distribution point on a daily basis. The community water monitors will register the collection of the water in a register book with the household representative and signing or thumb print as a record. All the supplied water will be chlorinated. In addition, a list of recommended boreholes will be mapped out for water trucking. This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

        "description": "The proposed six-month project aims to provide urgent lifesaving assistance to flood-affected communities in Beletweyne while mainstreaming protection and integrating sustainable, flood-resistant solutions. The WASH intervention will improve the health and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in flood-affected communities through increased access to safe water, use of latrines, hygiene promotion and increased adoption of safe hygiene practices. Cash programming, in the form of conditional transfers, vouchers, and cash for work (CfW), will form a core pillar of the proposed intervention. Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

Already at least 6.3 million people, nearly half of the country\u2019s population are affected by the situation. More than 548,000 people in Somalia have been forced to flee their homes due to flooding in the Hiran region (Belet Weyne, Buuloburto and Jalalaqsi) including children (OCHA report Nov.). Belet Weyne town and the surrounding areas of Hiran region of Somalia is the worst affected where more than 140,000 people are already flee from their homes with empty handed and displaced highland locations, while some households displaced to their relatives living non flood affected areas, putting burden to already vulnerable communities with limited resources (food and water). Authorities and the local community members are trying to mitigate the impact of the floods in residential areas. However, flood risks are still high considering the flow of water to downstream areas of River Shabelle as water levels in Belet Weyne are receding. In this proposal, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in Jalalaqsi district. Under this allocation, AADSOM will improve better access to clean water, use of latrines and increased health promotion and safe hygiene practices to 20,000 women, men, boys and girls including people with disabilities and marginalized communities affected by the current floods. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project include:\n- Provision of safe water to 1000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Upgrade/Rehabilitation of one strategic borehole equipped with hybrid system and rehabilitation of flood damaged 20 shallow wells with hand pumps. \n- Capacity building of 11 WASH committees and 42 Well Operators to ensure continuity of service, operation and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross cutting\n- Construction flood destructed 214 gender separated and flood proof latrines and 6 gender sensitive flood proof institutional latrines in Nasrudin Primary School with lockable doors to avoid GBV against women and girls and washing basin benefiting around 245 students.\n- Conducting comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 20,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers and feeding centers \n-Training 15 community hygiene promoters, who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out and \n-Distribution of 1000 HP kits to 1000 households (UNICEF will supply) with vulnerable populations served by the established water services. \nThe proposed response took into consideration the impact of women, and children in terms of access to WASH services.

Since inception, the Somalia NGO Consortium has grown as an effective network, actively supporting its members to promote dialogue, collaboration, learning experiences, information exchange and to advocate on issues of key concern. Currently, the Consortium is the primary NGO coordination and representation mechanism, with a membership of 93 national and international NGOs working in all parts of Somalia/Somaliland, around humanitarian, development, peace-building, health, education among other thematic areas.  Governed by a Steering Committee elected by the membership, the SNC provides a platform for information-sharing and representation to governments, UN agencies, donor groups and multilateral organisations at local, national and international levels. The Consortium has offices and representation in Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Garowe, Baidoa, Kismayo and plans to expand its reach to constituencies in the remaining federal states through extensive outreach work from the current offices. The SNC expects to reach 100 NGOs by end of 2019 which will increase membership needs. The SNC is currently co-funded through Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), OFDA (USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and membership subscription fees. Legal and contractual responsibilities associated with funding and contracting are held by host agencies, as SNC is not a legally constituted entity, but rather a network of its membership. During the relocation process in 2019, the SNC has gone through transitions on multiple levels including management and relocation form Nairobi to Mogadishu. Our costs and needs from our membership have significantly increased and significant positions are left unfilled including Advocacy Officer, Deputy Director and Grants amp Partnership Officer. SNC's annual budget for 2020 is estimated to be around $1,409,806 USD. Further information can be found below on budget secured and proposals submitted.",

        "description": "TThe NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO.\n\nIn response to and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed by 4 INGOs and 1 LNGOs), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support.\n\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor Assistants, NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 41,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions, injuries and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs. \n\nThe project budget leans heavily on HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "The overall goal of the project is to contribute to improvement of living conditions and access to basic services for displaced in persons by bolstering effectiveness of coordination mechanisms and community led governance structures in Luuq which is a CCCM under-served area. The envisaged actions will set the foundation for attaining durable solutions through strengthened community self-management. DRC will facilitate the analysis of needs and intervention gaps within IDP sites in Luuq, initiating advocacy for support to respond to identified needs and gaps, as well as protection concerns. DRC will also contribute to the administrating and documenting regular cluster meetings in collaboration with UNHCR. DRC will engage local authorities including governmental and community leadership to work towards durable solutions for displaced populations. \n\nThe project will engage implementing partners and relevant authorities on identified needs, gaps, and overlaps. Furthermore, DRC will advocate for and support the adoption of an area-based approach for service delivery in IDP sites. The project will conduct training of relevant government authorities in CCCM principles to enhance their understanding of humanitarian assistance through the CCCM model.\n\nDRC will take on responsibility for targeted IDP sites to undertake the following:\n- Map out existing governance structures and focal points at the targeted IDP sites. Where governance structures exist, their capacity will be built in camp management and other essential principles. Where these governance structures are absent, DRC will facilitate their establishment through the creation of Camp Management Committees (CMCs).\n- Monitor service delivery in the IDP sites through CCCM Mobile Teams to identify any service gaps and overlaps of interventions by implementing agencies.\n- Reinforce accountability to displaced populations through increasing communication and feedback on availability of services. This will be done through multiple approaches including construction and establishment of community centers for information hubs, and through awareness raising campaigns about site services. Furthermore, DRC will establish and strengthen complaint and feedback mechanisms (CFMs) in sites. For referrals, DRC will work with existing protection stakeholders on appropriate and principled referrals, with particular attention to protection concerns, and service delivery to persons with special needs.\n- Work to improve site safety and hygiene through a participatory approach, utilizing a cash-for-work modality to carry out site maintenance activities. This additionally links participating IDP residents to temporary income and encourages ownership of the site. Site safety audits and fire hazard training will also be conducted.\n\nBeneficiary description:\nThe proposed intervention supports multiple stakeholders through camp management activities at the targeted five IDP sites with the aim of increased coordination at the site level, for displaced populations in  Luuq, where the established governance structures will hold monthly coordination meetings at the site level to discuss gaps and needs of IDP residents so that these identified gaps and needs will be taken  to the relevant humanitarian partners who assist in filling those gaps at the targeted sites.\nAt the present time, based on discussions with relevant stakeholders, DRC has selected the following sites to support:\n1.Ban Munduli (Akaro) - 715 H\u2019H\n2.Buyle - 520 H\u2019H\n3.Luuq Hilaac - 355 H\u2019H\n4.Jazeera - Jadiid - 450 H\u2019H\n5.Luuq Waaberi - 460 H\u2019H",

Education is critical during emergencies like drought. It protects children from risks and protection related concerns. School-aged children will be provided lifesaving education intervention to schools they are currently learning to prevent the risk of dropout as well as mitigate the protection risks. Equally, school-aged children who are displaced by the drought will be reached out to their places to ensure they have access to quality education and protection services in locations they moved to the proposed project will be targeting 4000 school aged children affected by the drought in 18 schools in Belethawa (4 schools), Bardhere (4 schools), Luuq (5 schools), Garbaharey (2 schools) and Burdhubo(3). The project will target 4000 school-aged drought affected children in Gedo (2,200 boys and 1,800 girls). Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies: As per the education minimum standard on teaching and learning materials, learners and teachers will be provided learning materials in accordance to set standards. Each grade 1-3 student will receive learning kit consisting of 7 books (6 single ruled and 1 single Squared100 sheets), 4 pencils, 4 rubbers and 2 sharpeners while students between Grade 4 and 8 will receive  7 books ((6 single ruled and 1 single Squared 100 sheets), 2 pens,2 rubbers , 1 sharpener and one student mathematics set. Bags will be given the girls provided for the sanitary kits to carry their sanitary materials to the schools to reduce their absence during menstrual period, emergency school feeding to promote retention of learners, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers, training of teachers and CECs on education and child protection, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. WASH Specific activities will include water trucking to the schools and construction of water storages (Barkets), the construction of gender segregated school latrines with hand-washing facilities.  As education is lifesaving, protection mainstreaming will be key and critical to ensure children have access to protective learning environment. HIRDA will conduct protection service mapping in the target schools. The members will be able to identify children with protection concern both at the school and community. They also, help in organising children led social mobilization campaign in the community. Also, organise structured recreational activities in the school4000 (1800 girls) learners will be provided with recreational materials as per the education cluster minimum standard. Children in the target locations will have access to structured recreational play in the schools. Through the recreational materials, children will have access to play and interact with other children. Children clubs will also be established in the target schools.\n\nHIRDA has been active education partner as well as nutrition and health. Based on its vast experienced field staff who benefited trainings offered by the education cluster and UNICEF, HIRDA will be directly implementing this project. The project will complement the ongoing alternative basic education, health and nutrition programmes funded by UNICEF. School-aged children will have access to nutrition screening exercise to identify children with acute malnutrition and treated. Equally, the health HIRDA team will prioritise the target schools to ensure children are dewormed and treated communicable diseases and illnesses.",

        "description": "The proposed project seeks to improve  immediate access to food and to protect and restore the livelihood-related food and income sources for the most vulnerable rural H.H living in rural  Baidoa villages in Bay region - Somalia. The project targets 1,350 households comprising of 8,247 boys, girls, women and Men. Project period will be 6 months. The primary target will be the most vulnerable families under the integrated food security classification (IPC) 3 and above that are currently living in  rural Baidoa villages. Target will be mainly villages of northern Baidoa namely Lawiiley (9km), Midow (12km) and Maaranka (15km) and small villages around these three. The assistance will be emergence-oriented agricultural support to 1350 rain fed farmers living in the target villages to secure harvest in the coming Deyr rainy season. The project will provide each family a package of farming seeds (sorghum (30kg) and cowpea (10kg)) and farming tools. The beneficiary farmers will be trained on the best agricultural practice/ good agricultural practice (GAP) to enhance and develop their capacities on farming. \nComplementary unconditional cash transfer (UCT) will be transferred to the target beneficiaries in a period of 3 months to improve immediate food access during the lean season. The monthly rate of the cash transfer is $30/family. This complies with March 2019 minimum expenditure basket (MEB) value recommended by CMWG in May 2019. It is anticipated that the cash transfer support will improve their food consumption, nutritional status of the children and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms that exposes women, children and other vulnerable groups to the risk of displacement. \nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and drought affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance.",

        "description": "The underperforming Deyr rains in 2018 and Gu rains in 2019 have heavily impacted the lives and livelihoods of households in Diinsoor which has led to an increase in the number of households in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and IPC Phase 4 (emergency). Rural populations in the hard-to-reach and undeserved areas around Diinsoor have been severely affected as result of poor agricultural production and limited access to services due to limited coverage by aid agencies. Household debt levels in this area remain high with many households utilizing negative coping mechanisms as a means to survive this lean period. Findings from a rapid needs assessment conducted by ACTED in Diinsoor on 16 and 23 June found that 62% of households do not regularly meet their food needs. Due to this dire situation, ACTED proposes an emergency short-term response to address the acute food insecurity and alleviate the humanitarian needs. The project will provide life-saving support to 1,614 vulnerable and drought affected households (9,684 individuals) through unconditional cash transfers in Diinsoor. ACTED plans to distribute four-months of consecutive unconditional cash transfers to these households from August until November 2019. Overall, these activities align with the Food Security cluster objective to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phase vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods. Moreover, the project aligns with the Somalia HRP 2019 objective to provide life-saving and life sustaining integrated assistance to reduce acute humanitarian needs and excess mortality among the most vulnerable people. Unconditional cash transfers act as a measure to prevent further deterioration of the food security of households and act as a buffer against the continued impact of the failed rains. These unconditional transfers in Diinsoor provide a quick response to increasing needs and enable households to access the functioning markets in Diinsoor.",

The project also seeks to conduct protection monitoring in Balad, Xudur and Wajid in order to provide critical protection related data to inform future interventions due to both absence of protection related information and to the increasing influx of newly conflict displaced people into the District witnessed in the last months. \n\nJointly with the protection monitoring activities, the key focus of the project will be providing Case management services for UASC through immediate care, referrals and family tracing as well as response to GBV survivors. The project will establish referral system in schools and support community-based Child Protection Mechanisms for quick and efficient referrals of children with protection needs through service mapping within the community and in the schools (community child protection committees and School Management Committees). This project will strengthen service mapping to facilitate appropriate referrals, coordination and linkages in service delivery to ensure quality comprehensive services to unaccompanied and separated children (children at risk of being recruited by armed forces or armed groups and gender based violence (GBV) survivors. The project will further improve prevention and response to separation of children from their families through family tracing and reunification activities and provision of comprehensive case management and psycho-social support including emergency care, referral to INTERSOS medical teams trained in CMR, access tailored material assistance, and follow up on the services for gender based violence survivors. Capacity building of CPWG to strengthen and improve identification of cases and increase their knowledge on child protection minimum standards will also be provided. Moreover, by promoting meaningful access, safety and dignity in our intervention.\nINTERSOS will conduct awareness that will focus on rights of children and men and women, roles and responsibilities of children, causes and consequence of separation as well as consequences of the incidences of gender based violence, Mine risk education, identification and reporting unaccompanied and separated children and GBV survivors, services available for Gender Based Violence survivors and unaccompanied and separated children as well as appropriate referrals in place in the target location. \nMoreover, based on the lessons learnt from the previous SHF and UNFPA funded project in the same target location, there is need to scale up protection activities including improving the quality of response services, particularly medical care, psycho social support, case management and emergency safe spaces.\n\nFurthermore, In Balad, Xudur and Wajid, INTERSOS will conduct and strengthen protection monitoring in areas of settlement of returnees and IDPs through community based protection monitors working with CSOs in order to ensure that quality evidence based reports about protection issues and human rights violations and systematic collection of protection related data are produced to inform better response and advocacy.

HIDIG will leverage of its ongoing WASH and nutrition activities to provide access to an integrated life-saving health services to an estimated 21,000 drought affected and urban poor host communities in Baidoa district through one static health facilities, and six mobile clinics, with a focus on maternal and child Health in partnership with the Ministries of Health and other healthcare service providers. The SHF funds will be used to support a critical response integrated with WASH and nutrition to respond to the health needs of malnourished children and women in Baidoa. The proposed response aims to respond to only areas with critical rates of malnutrition and measles and suspected AWD/Cholera hotspots where immediate provision of lifesaving emergency healthcare is intended to be carried out. For example, Bay region accounts for 48% of all measles cases in South Somalia which make up five regions. HIDIG implemented health project in Baidoa district in partnership with SHF in 2018, which has ended. To build on the gains achieved in 2018 and the ongoing routine immunization support from UNICEF, the proposed project will provide free emergency obstetric care including ANC, skilled delivery and PNC to 1,050 eligible women and improve referral system through provision of timely transportation. Overall, 21,000 direct beneficiaries, including 5,040 girls, 4,200 boys, 6,510 women, 5,250 men will benefit from the services. The organization will conduct routine and supplementary measles immunization targeted at children under-five in target areas. In addition, the capacity of 35 staff will be improved through training so that frontline staff in disaster events marked by a sudden or gradual increase in demand for healthcare services and a related decrease in the supply of resources available to provide such care can act. This will result in a community healthcare-sector response that can implement a variety of surge capacity strategies that include steps taken to reduce demand for care, e.g., the implementation of community-based triage capabilities and risk communication about when to seek care and the strengthening of referral care capacity in addition to better described inpatient care strategies. In this context, fifty community members will also obtain an increased knowledge and skills on community management of childhood illnesses. HIDIG is an active health cluster member in Bay, Bakol and Hiiraan regions and will actively share information with the cluster, UNOCHA and the Ministry of Health, both at state level and federal. The target district is accessible, and the organization has an active PCA with UNICEF in reducing maternal mortality rate through skilled deliveries and strengthening referral system in Somalia. These proposed interventions adhere to the SHf\u2019s life-saving criteria as they respond to time-critical requirements and contribute to reducing the loss of lives. Bay region has more than 12,000 people in IPC 4 and 176,000 in IPC 3, indicating the scale of the acute malnutrition in the region. Because of this, HIDIG requires support and additional resources are urgently required as health and nutrition facilities are seeing more people in need. HIDIG will coordinate its interventions with respective line ministries and other NGOs to ensure there is no duplication in the response and that critical gaps are covered",

        "description": "Displacement related to conflict and drought continues to be one of the major driver of humanitarian needs in Puntlnd and in particularly in Taleex and Xudun districts in Sool region.  According to FSNAU post deryr 2018  assessment report indicated that deterioration of  nutrition situation in Sool region with GAM rate (lt15%) due to high morbidity, low immunization ,Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. Additionally, extreme water and pasture shortages have led to an increased incidence of acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/ cholera outbreaks, which have already been reported in many villages in Sool region. According to rapid assessment conducted by KAALO in February 2019  showed, majority of the health facilities in the assessed villages lacked basic supplies and staff incentives as well as shortage of appropriate reproductive health kits, supplies and commodities. KAALO in partnership with SHF and UNICEF has been implementing an integrated health and WASH project at target location since 2015.The health facilities are facing extreme funding gaps, shortage of supplies and poor referral system. KAALO proposes to scale up its health interventions to save lives, mitigate emergencies, reduce mortality amp morbidity and fill gaps of health services for drought affected people through 2 fixed health facilities with two mobile clinics targeting 28,000 direct beneficiaries including (7000 WCBA, 5600 children under five) in Sool region. The  sexual and reproductive health SRH intervention consists in supporting the provision of basic and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services to all people at target districts and ensuring particularly the good health and well-being of mothers and newborns. This is done by supporting national health facilities in strengthening the health system strategy, equipping conflict-affected health facilities with emergency reproductive health kits, training health workers IMCI, BEmOC for reproductive health and deploying mobile teams in hard-to-reach areas to directly support the provision of services. Qualified nurses/ midwives will provide preventative and curative services, antenatal care, skilled delivery, postnatal care, treatment of common illnesses. The child health services include immunization of children under five years and promotion services including health education, growth monitoring, de-worming and supplementation with vitamin A. The mobile health teams will provide primary health Services for undeserved and hard to reach areas. They will also provide basic mental health and Psychosocial Support services and referral services. At the end of the project , a total of 28000 affected community (7000 women, 8400 girls, 8400 boys and 4200 men) improved and increased availability of health care including: promotive, preventative and curative services , reproductive health  and improved case management of childhood illnesses through two fixed health facilities with mobile outreach teams in Sool region.",

        "description": "The Nutrition and health situation remains fragile in Hobyo with children and women being most vulnerable. The key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional health system. Tied to that is minimal capacity available in the nutrition and health sector and  poor community literacy levels  (UNICEF 2018 WHO 2017). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease (UNICEF,2018, FSNAU,2018).\n Although there has been progress noted in service provision and policy development in Somalia including: roll out of national development plan with inclusion of a section on Nutrition and mainstreaming it to sectors (SNDP,2017), 2017-20 health sector strategic plan (FMoH,2017) and other health related policies, frameworks and guidelines,a lot still needs to be done to actualized these.\nIts important to note that disparities in health outcomes among Somali children and women still exist. These are based on: their exposure to violence and insecurity, access, gender and ethnic groupings, and the stability of communities/clan structure. Addressing these inequities, remains a priority (UNICEF,2018). This brings to light the fact that the situation in Hobyo  could be worse than national statistics considering that factors mentioned above fully exist here.\nServices in Hobyo barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure and harsh climate conditions. Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2018SAF UK,2018 SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2019). There are reports of drought and food shortages causing many to leave there homes in search of food and water. The is therefore need for urgent attention if the situation is to be controlled.\nGender issues that lock out significant others increasing negative social pressure on women not to adapt behaviors beneficial to health, should be addressed for positive nutrition outcomes to be realized. Finally capacity of service providers and locals communities to control malnutrition should be improved for quality service, resilient communities and sustainable projects.\nThe proposed interventions will link with  cluster objective one, two and four, and SHF 2019 1 standard allocation core elements  one,three, four, five and six, which cover provision of immediate life saving and time critical interventions, focus on communities affected by deteriorating nutrition of GAMgt15% , integration of services across sectors, protection mainstreaming and rapid response  enabling the most urgent scaling up of essential humanitarian activities,\nInterventions will also seek to provide primary ,secondary and tertiary prevention for acute malnutrition, build resilience to cushion against shocks in future and provide a platform to discuss and initiate durable solutions  in conjunction with other clusters and relevant bodies thus preventing shocks and ensuring protection.\nSAF UK has been implementing nutrition (OTP,TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) and health projects in north Hobyo for 2 years, but only covering  Afbarwaqo and surrounding villages, reporting huge impact \nThis proposed project seeks to scale up treatment of MAM beyond our current coverage through additional 3 fixed sites in health facilities and 4 mobile sites to access hard to reach areas. Additionally,the current  supplementary feeding project funded by WFP expires on 30th March 2019. We hope to sustain these services (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) ,avoiding gaps. \nOur proposal is  to provide supplementary feeding interventions (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP)  further integrating with health  project in all proposed sites for cost effective sustainable project",

        "description": ".The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Somaliland and Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Areas of particular concern include Northern Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed, and Galkacayo IDP which are experiencing emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. GAM rates of 10-14.9% are present in Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer. Similarly, the nutrition situation in Galkacayo IDPs is at a critical level and may deteriorate further without humanitarian assistance. According to the nutrition cluster nutrition burden estimate that was released in February 2019, in Galkayo IDPs, the nutrition situation was at a critical level with a GAM rate of 20.2% which is above the emergency threshold of GAMgt15%. Despite the high (estimated to be 61,092 by the health cluster) caseload of children with acute malnutrition in these regions, access to live saving nutrition services remains limited. In order to address these gaps, the proposed project will improve access and provide nutrition services to children aged 0 to 59 months and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) with acute malnutrition through detection and treatment in the targeted nutrition sites. Particular attention will be on the following activities: Training of Community Volunteers in the identification and referral of malnutrition cases to Save the Children   supported   nutrition centers, and mothers trained in mother-led MUAC to enlarge coverage with close monitoring from Save the Children to prevent wrong referrals and ensure quality of the screening and understanding of the community Provision of Outpatient Therapeutic Feeding (OTP) services for children aged 6-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) for Moderately Acute Malnourished children (MAM) and PLW through mobile outreach teams. Referring children aged 0-59 months identified with SAM coupled with medical complication, and SAM infants aged under 6 months with or without medical complications to the nearest stabilization center. The proposed nutrition project is mainly targeting Galkacayo IDPs (27), Awdal (30) and Woqooyi Galbeed (21) and Digaale and Jimaale HFs in Hargeisa IDPs locations, that are most affected by the current drought in Somalia. The project also promotes and supports optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding practices through the screening of breastfeeding difficulties amongst mothers of children under two years of age, provision of one to one counselling for mothers and caretakers with difficulties with regards to Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices and raising awareness of caregivers and relatives on the importance of appropriate IYCF. The project is targeting 59,971 direct beneficiaries, 27,830 will be from the IDPs while 32,141 beneficiaries will be from the Host Communities. In addition, a total of  96,904 beneficiaries will be reached with key IYCF messages in the targeted areas. The proposed project will incorporate learnings from previous projects on how women and girls can participate meaningfully in nutrition interventions.One of the learnings is that mothers in the IDP settlements a lead role in championing for IYCF interventions once they receive sufficient training, this is because they gained a deeper understanding of the importance of breastmilk to children and were willing to breastfeed exclusively if they had a source of livelihood.Another learning is that women can be powerful agents of change when it comes to hygiene promotion once they understand the benefits of good hygiene practices and this has a positive impact on the whole community particularly as women tend to be the sole custodians of household and child rearing chores.",

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proj\nect's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinic?s personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

        "description": "The project builds on the previous TB intervention implemented by LSV. However in order to increase effectiveness totally new strategies will be applied.TB continues to be an essential health problem in Somalia. The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rathe\nr new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the privat\ne sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration \nwith the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and \nparticipation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB cult\nure services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to \nTB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO\n called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The \nproject will help the poorest of the poor. For example many cases are found among people who suffer from malnutrition.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017.

The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict. The funds received under DFID are to support activities under Outcome 2, in addition these activities are under \u2018Outcome 3: Sustainable local government investment vehicles are identified, designed and operated\u2019, in the Local Investment for Transformation in Somalia (LIFT-Somali) agreement with UNCDF.",

The main area of research and learning will be changes in access to services (access to health facilities in DRC and access to justice in Somalia) and how this contributes to conflict prevention and to inclusive peacebuilding processes.

The proposed project seeks to challenge harmful social norms including Female Genital Mutilation and Child Early and Forced Marriage and to increase womens social and economic empowerment through interventions at the individual, household, community and societal levels. Successful implementation of these interventions will result in reduction in harmful practices, increased value of women and girls and will contribute towards greater voice, choice and control for Somali women and girls over their bodies and futures (Project Impact). This will be achieved transforming social norms to support gender equality in Somalia (Outcome) through three key outcome areas: 1) Enhanced legal and policy environment for greater equality of women and girls; 2) Improved knowledge and attitudes of men, women, girls and boys on gender discriminatory social norms; and 3) Increased social and economic empowerment of women and girls.

        "title": "SRC Agreement 2017-2019",
        "description": "On January 27, 2017 the Swedish Red Cross (SRC) submitted an application to Sida for the above-mentioned program with an initial budget of 167.5 MSEK for 2017, 16 MSEK for 2018 and 16 MSK for 2019. The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises, and their capacity to recover afterwards, and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.\n\nFunds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments, after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017, following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 4,5 MSEK to13,5 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with, and Sida's approval of, additional applications for these contexts, and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. \n\nThe SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida's support to national societies, the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon, DR Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. \n\nThe SRC\u2019s strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC \u2013 is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC\u2019s new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does, however, put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation\u2019s application 2017-2019. Several programmes with a long-term development focus have been removed in the application for funding from Sida, and new initiatives with a sharper humanitarian focus have been included, such as Yemen and Cameroon (programme targeting CAR refugees). It will be important to follow up on this positive direction towards a strengthened humanitarian relevance to the Sida-funded projects to ensure its continuation.\n\nSupport planned for 2017 includes long-term programs in various fields such as health, disaster prevention, resilience, sanitation, organizational development, volunteer development and planning, monitoring, evaluation and results (PMER). The support also includes regional support to the IFRC\u2019s different cluster- and regional offices in Africa, Asia and MENA. Thematic- and capacity enhancement support will in 2017 focus on disaster reduction, volunteering in conflict and disaster, water and sanitation, health, and gender and diversity.

LPI applying for support from Sida / Embassy in Nairobi for the program of which Sweden is funding 44% of the total budget 80 356 743 SEK. LPI has applied for EU funding through their call for proposals that are taking place during March 2017. LPI is applying for funding together with the Somali partner Somali Peace Line (SPL). LPI is currently investigating other potential donors. LPI has adjusted the current planning for 2017 to fit with the proposed support from Sida (and EU funds for CRM Phase II). The program is currently underfunded by 26%.\n\nThe head of the development cooperation with Somalia hereby makes a decision to divert from the requirement of bringing the appraisal for assessment in the Embassy common quality assurance committee QAC. Although the proposed budget exceeds the amount of 20MSEK that requires the intervention to be assessed in the embassy Committee, it is hereby decided to divert from this requirement based on Sida's good record of cooperation with LPI from the support of its Somalia program as well as global programs, as well as the time-pressured situation where funding to address the drought situation and famine should be given priority. The proposal, has however been taken up for discussion in the Somali Section's internal committee where it was assessed as highly relevant and with the recommendation that a decision to be taken on support.\n\nDue to the fact that Sweden's strategy for development cooperation with Somalia expires after 2017 and a new strategy is planned for the periode between 2018-2021, Sida is restricted to commit to funding for years beyond 2019. Consequently, Sida and LPI will enter into agreement for the period 2017-2019 with the option to extend the agreement with addition of funds for the year 2020.\n\nThe proposal also includes an integrated component of emergency aid to the ongoing and severe drought that hit the country in 2016 and continues to pose a threat in 2017. According to LPI, this response, with activities such as the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, job creation efforts, health nutritional packages, cholera prevention, hygiene training, food ration and the distribution of food parcels, knowledge about basic health program and services, strengthening social cohesion etc., constitutes a prerequisite to conduct the comprehensive peace building work in the areas that are the hardest hit by the drought. This initiative will run for three months and be reported separately (narrative, financial) in the first half-year reporting. LPI will forward 5,4MSEK to ZamZam Foundation (ZZF) for implementation of their drought response between April to June 2017.

The audit of the funds to the emergency response will be covered in the annual audit. \n \nThe proposal builds upon the positive results from the program Conflict Transformation (2013-2016; extended to Feb 2017), namely;\n- Reduction in violent clashes and addressing intra and inter-clan conflicts across 5 regions of south central Somalia;\n- Peace agreements reached;\n- Women's increased inclusion in peacebuilding processes;\n- LPI\u2019s civil society partners demonstrated increased peacebuilding capacity;\n- Analysis and lessons on the importance of bottom-up peacebuilding and community engagement in statebuilding and the need for inclusive peace processes that engage a wide range of stakeholders across political divides, have been fed directly into key policy arenas at local, national and international levels. LPI has also contributed to regional debates on humanitarian conflict sensitivity.\n\nAs part of the Mid-Term Review conducted by Sipu in 2015, some recommendations for improvement were highlighted of which all have been addressed by LPI and consequently formed the proposal for the 2017-2019 program.\n-Strengthen inclusivity, such as mainstreaming and directly influencing social practices and norms so peace processes are more inclusive of all marginalised groups.\n- Encourage adoption of transparent, democratic processes that create space for broad representation and enable people to express their needs and priorities, e.g. through separate consultations or dialogues amongst specific groups, careful validation from communities regarding those chosen to represent them, and/or objective leader report back mechanisms to communities after dialogues.\n-LPI and partners will sensitively accommodate cultural norms and processes, whilst simultaneously influencing, renovating and expanding them. \n-Strengthen scenario planning with partners and communities so intentional planning for inevitable crises and their management is better built into the evolution of long-term peace processes. \n-Ensuringing local peace processes facilitated as part of programme to make use of opportunities to bring in other stakeholders, such as local authorities, government, or non-state actors in control of areas in appropriate ways that do not disempower local communities or clans, but encourages shared responsibility by all stakeholders. \n-The programme will adopt approaches that identify where these tensions become manifest intentionally explore with communities acceptable responses that address and/or resolve them.\n-The combination of developing a common deep understanding of the issues, mutual moral support, standing alongside partners and mutual capacity building is critical in developing trust, programme effectiveness and appropriate adaptive iterative approaches to complex contextual developments.\n\nThe overall objective of the program is to contribute to stability and peace in Somalia by supporting reconciliation processes which address the causes of grievance and conflict at the local level, reinforced by dedicated policy actors which promotes peace frameworks and state-building efforts.\n\nThe strategic priorities and methods for achieving the overall objectives are capacity development of civil society, including women's advocacy towards decision makers within the government as well as those who otherwise preparing policies in the field, the development and strengthening of conflict prevention mechanisms, the promotion of a culture of tolerance and research.\n\nThe method to achieve the overall objectives is assessed to be in accordance with the Swedish strategies and policies for Somalia and for the thematic area of human security.

        "description": "New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis is an intervention for the continued support of MSEK 475 to the \"UN Multi-Partnership Trust Fund\" (MPTF) for Somalia in 2018-2019. In Decision 2016-002435, dated 30 June 2015, Sida decided to support MPTF 2015-2017 with an amount of 140 MSEK. Following the decision 52/16 from November 2016, an additional 33 MSEK was added and an additional  55 MSEK through decision 14/17, dated April 24, 2017 and finally 10 MSEK was added in Dwecember 2017 through decision 58/2017. Sida assess that the MPTF and the joint programs that Sweden contributes to delivers results despite some challenges that comes with implementation of programmes in a difficult context.\n\nSomalia is one of the poorest countries in the world and is characterized by inequality. Recurrent humanitarian crises and armed conflicts pose challenging to the development of the country. Furthermore, Somalia is affected by climate change and recurring periods of drought. 2.3 million people have insecure food supplies and there are over one million internally displaced persons. Of a population of about 12 million, over 70% are poor and more than 40% live in extreme poverty. One of seven children dies before their first birthday; one of eighteen women die in childbirth; and only one in three persons have access to safe drinking water. Over 70% of Somalia's population is under thirty years and lack employment opportunities which leave many of them with few prospects for the future. Women are structurally discriminated and gender based violence is widespread. Somalia has the highest incidence of female genital mutilation in the world. Women also lack access to justice that can protect their interests. The lack of a formal and effective legal justice system in most parts of the country has led to extensive impunity. In 2017, Somalia was ranked as the most corrupt country in the world according to Transparency International.\n\nHowever, a relatively peaceful political process for state building has begun. The increasing international support in recent years has contributed to progress in many areas. The implementation of the indirect parliamentary election held in the fall of 2016 with increased political representation of women in addition to the presidential elections in February 2017 followed by a peaceful change of power are particularly positive signs.\n\nThe MPTF was established in 2015 with Sweden as one of the first donors. The fund currently manages a total of USD 200 million. The two biggest donors are the EU followed by UK. So far, Sweden has contributed with 238 MSEK during the period and is thereby the third largest donor to the fund. During the period 2015-2017, Sweden has supported the central political processes (elections, constitution, parliament and the new federal state formation), the development of the judiciary, job creation for young people, and public administration. Furthermore, Sweden has provided support to the UN's core functions to enable effective implementation in a challenging context like Somalia. In addition, pilot support for the fund's so-called \"national window\", to use Somalia\u2019s own country systems have been successfully supported to a prison rehabilitation facility, supplementing the above-mentioned legal aid program. Despite challenges on an overall level, it is Sida's assessment that these programs together deliver results.\n\nMoreover, Sida assess that the MPTF is now fully established and that the programmes that are funded are implemented satisfactory. The international community has made significant commitments. Somalia has developed a National Development Plan (NDP) for Somalia 2017-2019. In addition, a Security Pact was adopted at the Somalia Conference held in May 2017 in London. The Security Pact sets out the roadmap for a Comprehensive Approach to Security, CAS. Hence, the UN has developed its own strategic plan (UNSF) for Somalia that reflects both the NDP and CAS. The MPTF is the main funding mechanism for UN support the implementation on the UNSF.\n\nSida assess that the MPTF continues to be relevant and appropriate mechanism to deliver support. Based on Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Somalia and the new Strategy to come, Sida proposes that the continued support to the MPTF shall be earmarked for the following thematic areas and for the programs decided in the framework of these:\n1. Including policies, governance and federal state building, as well as reconciliation\n2. Human rights, women, peace and security\n3. Economic recovery and resilience\n4. Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights\n\nWithin the area of Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights, 140 MSEK will be earmarked to UNFPA\u2019s country programme for Somalia 2018-2020. For more information on the assessment of UNFPA as a strategic partner to Sida in Somalia, pleas se decision 28/2017, dated 2017-06-22. In addition, 60 MSEK shall be earmarked for the so-called \"Enablers Program\", which includes support for the UN Risk Management Unit, the UN department for Security, and the Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO), which is considered to be crucial for implementation of all development efforts in Somalia. \n\nHowever, the MPTF is not only a financing mechanism but also constitutes a platform for donor coordination in a broader sense since it includes the major actors such as the EU, UK, US, NO, DE, and DK. At the same time, there is a trend that the EU and the UK are launching new bilateral programs in certain areas, while other donors such as DE will expand their support in favor of the MPTF. The MPTF is an important and a key instrument for cooperation between the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia to realize the overall development goals of sustainable peace and development in Somalia.\n\nThe MPTF will harmonize and align the significant resources that are channeled through the UN in Somalia and as such it is foreseen to a more effective international support for Somalia. If the international community, the FSG and other stakeholders cooperate to reduce the risks, it is Sida's assessment that objectives will be reached to a reasonable extent despite the complex context and the many challenges it entails.\n\nThe draft agreement follows that between the UNDP and Sida agreed template for the current form of cooperation. The new standard Standard Administrative Arrangement, SAA will regulate Sweden's contribution to the MPTF. The SAA will be signed by Sida and UNDP as the administrative agent. A Terms of Reference for the MPTF as well as a Memorandum of Understanding between all implementation UN partners are attached. Sida\u2019s conditions in the contribution management rule are thereby fulfilled. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement has been signed between the Government of Somalia and UNDP as an administrative agent.",

        "description": "Somalia is ranked bottom in global indicators on gender inequality, maternal, reproductive and neonatal health and survival. One in 22 women dies every year due to pregnancy or childbirth related complications.  Neonatal deaths in children (i.e. deaths in children during the first 28 days of life) occur at a higher rate in Somalia than in any other country in the world (UNICEF 2016). Fertility in women is high with an average of 6.6 children per woman. At the same time, the incidence of gender-related violence among women including child marriages and forced marriage (more than 45 percent of girls under 18 years and one in 10 girls under 15 have been forced to marriages) and female gender mutilation (about 98 percent) are still high in the country. Women and girls have limited ability, if at all, to decide over their own bodies such when and whom to marry and when and how many children she wants and desires. Family planning still remains a difficult subject to openly discuss. Women seek these services in secrecy. \n\nUNFPA has after engagement by the embassy submitted a request to Sida for continued support to UNFPA:s country program document for the period 2011-2015, which has been formally extended until 31 December 2017. Focus for the CPD is on four key areas: 1) reproductive, maternal and neonatal health; 2) gender equality, with a special attention on SGBV; FGM and early marriage; 3) population data and statistiks; and 4) youh. Sweden has given support to UNFPA since 2014 within the framework of the previous joint health and nutrition program (JHNP) which ended in April 2017. Within the framework of JHNP, UNFPA has contributed to several important results, including: 1) training, quality assurance and registration of midwives; 2) maternal health services for pregnant women including increased access to modern contraception; 3) advocacy and community engagement in preventing female genital mutilation, child marriages, and violence against women; and 4) legal support towards for FGM and SGBV bill, both approved and adopted in Puntland region of Somalia while in federal government and in Somaliland the bills are awaiting parliament approval. UNFPA's work has a clear ownership of the Somali government and its federal administrations.\n\nIn addition to Sweden, UNFPA recieved new funding during 2017 from Finland, UK, Japan and Italy. Swedens longer-term support to UNFPA Somalia operations will be aligned with the new UNFPA Country Program Document (CPD) for the period 2018-2020, which is expected to be endorsed on the September board meeting in New York, and which will be part of the Swedens support to the UN Multi Partner Trust Fund Phase II which will be assessed during late autumn 2017.",

        "description": "Every year, tens of thousands of boys and girls are recruited and used by armed groups worldwide. This is happening despite international agreements to end the use of children under the age of 18 in armed conflicts. The issue was highlighted further through Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 in Agenda 2030 that among other things calls for immediate and effective measures to eradicate the worst forms of child labour, including the recruitment and use of childsoldiers. Despite these commitments, children are used in armed conflicts and countries are experiencing enormous challenges in convincing fighting parties to release children and find ways to reintegrate them into society. \n\nChildren who are released have often gone through traumatic experiences and are sometimes imprisoned or stigmatized by communities who see them as a continued threat. UNICEF works closely with its partners to avoid that children are separated from their families and has, through advocacy with armed groups since 2016, assisted with the release of 22 500 children out of which 11 300 children have been reintegrated with their communities. Among the activities are psychosocial support, support to continued education and activities that increase social cohesion and peacebuilding. \n\nIn situations of protracted conflicts, there are often gaps in financing when emergency aid through humanitarian assistance often needs to focus on more urgent needs and where development cooperation yet has not been established. Support to the release and reintegration of children formerly associated with armed groups needs extended funding to be sustainable. In order to build resilience against re-recruitment and strengthen young boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 engagement and participation in peacebuilding in support of social cohesion, the gaps that occur between humanitarian and development aid need to be bridged. UNICEF works to bridge this gap through \u2018The New Way of Working\u2019 and has identified the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Somalia as three countries where more than 50% of the children that have been released from armed groups yet are to receive support to socio-economic reintegration programmes. Sida\u2019s support therefore aims at bridging this gap within the three country contexts in order to assist UNICEF in its work to release and reintegrate children in a more sustainable way. \nThe long-term goal of the intervention is \u201cTo contribute to ending and preventing grave violations committed against children in armed conflict, including the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups, and to supporting the release and reintegration of these children\u201d.",

        "description": "The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) is the UN\u2019s capital investment agency for the world\u2019s 47 Least Developed Countries (LDCs). UNCDF uses its capital mandate to help LDCs pursue inclusive growth through financing inclusive financial systems and by facilitating access to capital for e.g. climate resilence investments. UNCDF is affiliated to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and is included by their processes, policies and regulations.\n\nThe UNCDF activities are performed through two main pillars: Financial Inclusion and Local Development Finance. A third, method-based pillar called the LDC Investement Platform (LDCIP) has recently been established to provide alternative financial instruments such as loans and guarantees, utilizing the UNCDF's previously given mandate. This development is significant for the contribution, as UNCDF's ecosystem approach, utilizing blended finance i.e. a mix of different forms of financial instruments as well as partners, make them unique. It also makes UNCDF a strategic partner for Sida within the field of innovative financing in relation to both economically and environmentally sustainable development, working for economic transformation in LDCs. \n\nThe UNCDF, together with local partners, identifies and developes a financial product or service, e.g. an innovation related to micro-credits or climate finance. UNCDF contributes to the development of the product through technical assistance, grants, loans, a guarantee, or a mixture of instruments. From that point, other actors, such as banks or a local authority, can take the product further and scale it up. The model means that UNCDF together with local actors identifies bankable projects (1), the project receives grants and/or TA to further develop the innovation (2), UNCDF extends a loan/guarantee (3),  and finally UNCDF refers the project for co-investment or to a commercial actor (4). This approach takes its point of departure from the assumption that UNCDF acts as a front runner that can pave the way for other actors with bigger potential for upscaling, through UNCDF taking risks that commercial or public actors would not be willing to do, inspiring a behavioral and systems change. By doing so, UNCDF is in a position for building a pipeline of investment-ready projects that have been de-risked and can financed and upscaled by commercial or public capital. \n\nThe Contribution includes The Last Mile Finance Trust Fund (LMFTF) which includes the finance mechanism The Booster Fund as well as the programme Better than Cash Alliance (BtCA) which is hosted by UNCDF. The total sum of the intervention is 189 million SEK to be disbursed during the period 2019-2021, including an annual contribution of 8 million SEK to BtCA.\n\nThrough LMFTF, UNCDF acts to make  financial products such as savings, credits, insurance, payments and remittances available for the excluded and un-banked as well as to small and medium sized companies to a reasonable cost in a sustainable way. The fund's activities are performed through approximately 10 programs within 5 thematic areas (Green Economy, Food Security/Nutrition, Economic Empowerment for Women/Youth, Infrastructure and Financial Inclusion/Innovation) The programs have strong connections within these thematic areas but also between these. The programs are typically active in a number of countries, combined with a normative frame.\n\nWithin the framework of LMFTF there are multiple programs:\n- CleanStart, a program with the goal of providing 500 000 people with clean energy solutions (e.g. solar panels, mini grids, clean cooking stoves) through investments\n- Making Access Possible, an initiative to support financial inclusion through analysis and road mapping\n- DF+, which creates digital financial solutions for innovations which contribute to the SDGs \n- MicroLead, a global initiative that challenges financial service actors to develop, test and upscale deposit services for people with low incomes, especially rural women\n- The Finance for Food Security, which works for food security and against malnutrition through encouraging local, gender sensitive investments to fill the gaps of the local food system\n- IELD, which works with central and local governments to build capacity for gender responsive economic policy and seeks to identify hindrances for female participation in economic activity \n- Municipal Investments Finance, which supports municipalities in inproving the access to finance services, focusing on secondary cities within LDCs, as opposed to merely capital cities. \n\nThe Booster Fund is a mechanism under LMFTF through which UNCDF contributes with capital as well as technical assistance to both the private and public sector, with the purpose of strengthening their capacities for planning, budgeting and financing small scale infrastructure contributing to strengthened resilience in relation to climate change. Sida is the only finansier of this mechanism but programs under The Booster Fund is funded at bilateral level. The goal is to reduce poverty by \"boosting\" structural transformation of local economic systems by building environmental resilience and sustainability. Through the Booster Fund, UNCDF has through technical assistance and grants built a pipeline of projects ready for investments and upscaling.\n\nProgrammes within the Booster Fund (also par of the overall LMFTF umbrella):\n- Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL), which works with integrating climate adaption in local governments' planning and budgeting\n- EcoBonds, seeking to emit bonds on a municipal level for investments contributing to resilience\n- Local Finance Initiative (LFI), which seeks to establish local development units within the central administration of Tanzania and Uganda, supporting local development investments\n- CleanStart, a program with the goal of providing 500 000 people with clean energy solutions through investments\n\nThe third component, an independent program that is hosted by UNCDF \u2013 Better than Cash Alliance (BtCA) \u2013 is an alliance of countries and multi-national companies active in the digitalisation of payments. The purpose of BtCA is to enable digital payment solutions in order to build an including digital economy that contributes to the SDGs.\n\nTo exemplify UNCDF's work, in Bangladesh a UNCDF project developed models for participatory decision making on climate adaptive and resilient investments in local infrastructure. Successful pilot projects lead to the national government giving their support to the project, funding it and propelling the program to the degree that it was not possible for UNCDF to further house the project. In the third phase now running the entire country is covered by this support, where UNCDF's technical assistance ensures a focus on poverty, gender equality, and auditing, and helps strengthen administrative systems for monitoring and evaluation. In this case, UNCDF managed to leverage their funds so that eventually the World Bank took up the project, contributing a funding total of 72 times the original funding by UNCDF. This is illustrative of how UNCDF can lead systems change at a local and national level. \n\nAs an example of BtCA's work the government of Ethiopia has requested the Alliance to support the development of the National Digital Payments Strategy in order to accelerate the government\u2019s plans to digitize payments and the economy.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, the final goal of the intervention is to create including, equal and resilient financial markets and local financial systems that are more efficient in their ability to strengthen poor people, SMEs and local governments in the least developed countries.",

Sidas \u00e5rliga st\u00f6d till AAH bef\u00e4stes 2014 d\u00e5 ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett tre\u00e5rigt avtal, signerades.

Detta \u00e4r en st\u00f6dform som ger AAH m\u00f6jlighet att flexibelt allokera st\u00f6det till ej f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda humanit\u00e4ra behov inom l\u00e4nderna. Detta under f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning att insatserna faller inom l\u00e4ndernas respektive FN-ledda humanit\u00e4ra responsplaner samt de programdokument AAH har inkommit med till Sida. \n\n3.\tRAPID RESPONSE MECHANISM. Av den initiala allokeringen utg\u00f6r 35 miljoner kronor st\u00f6d i form av modellen Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), vilket ger AAH flexibilitet att snabbt tillskjuta medel till nya insatser som syftar till att besvara pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, och f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra behov. Sida m\u00e5ste dock, enligt avtal, godk\u00e4nna AAH:s f\u00f6rslag p\u00e5 n\u00e4r och var RRM-medlen kan nyttjas, vilket kan g\u00f6ras inom 24 timmar. \n\n4.\tMETODST\u00d6D. 2,2 miljoner kronor av den initiala allokeringen g\u00e5r till ett metodst\u00f6d, vilket syftar till att st\u00e4rka datainsamling och analys kopplad till undern\u00e4ring i Afrikas horn. \n\n\n\nBAKGRUND\n\nAction Against Hunger (AAH) grundades i Paris, Frankrike, 1979 f\u00f6r att bland annat ge st\u00f6d till afghanska flyktingar i Pakistan samt matos\u00e4kra hush\u00e5ll i Uganda. AAH har sedan dess vuxit kontinuerligt, och utg\u00f6r i dag en av de st\u00f6rsta humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rerna inom sitt huvudmandat; det vill s\u00e4ga, nutrition och mats\u00e4kerhet. Action Against Hunger gick tidigare under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF), men valde att byta namn f\u00f6r att s\u00e4tta en mer internationell pr\u00e4gel p\u00e5 organisationen.\n\nUnder 1990-talet utvecklade AAH ett internationellt n\u00e4tverk, vars styrelse i dag best\u00e5r av medlemmarna AAH Frankrike (Sidas avtalspartner), AAH Indien, AAH Kanada, AAH Spanien, AAH Storbritannien och AAH USA. AAH:s internationella n\u00e4tverk delar en strategisk plan, och medlemmarna har gemensamt framtagit en rad principer, som till exempel neutralitet, transparens och icke-diskriminering, vilka de alla lyder under.

Allokeringsprocessen utmynnar i att de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utv\u00e4ljs, vilket bland annat baseras p\u00e5 organisationernas relevans och effektivitet enligt iakttagelser fr\u00e5n tidigare f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljning. Det nu aktuella st\u00f6det till Action Against Hunger (AAH) baseras p\u00e5 Sidas humanit\u00e4ra allokeringsprocess, som f\u00e4rdigst\u00e4lldes under slutet av 2017. \n\nAktuell insats bygger vidare p\u00e5 tidigare \u00e5rs st\u00f6d till AAH, som tidigare gick under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF). Sidas \u00e5rliga st\u00f6d till AAH bef\u00e4stes 2014 d\u00e5 ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett tre\u00e5rigt avtal, signerades. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6regicks av en djupdykande utv\u00e4rdering, vilken bland annat framlyfte AAH:s goda expertis och renomm\u00e9 inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngdes senare f\u00f6r att \u00e4ven inkludera 2017. Ett nytt tre\u00e5rigt avtal (2018-2020) f\u00f6resl\u00e5s nu f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en fortsatt strategisk ansats i relation och partnerskap med AAH.

Detta \u00e4r en st\u00f6dform som ger AAH m\u00f6jlighet att flexibelt allokera st\u00f6det till ej f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda humanit\u00e4ra behov inom l\u00e4nderna. Detta under f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning att insatserna faller inom l\u00e4ndernas respektive FN-ledda humanit\u00e4ra responsplaner samt de programdokument AAH har inkommit med till Sida. \n\n3.\tRAPID RESPONSE MECHANISM. Av den initiala allokeringen utg\u00f6r 35 miljoner kronor st\u00f6d i form av modellen Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), vilket ger AAH flexibilitet att snabbt tillskjuta medel till nya insatser som syftar till att besvara pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, och f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra behov.

Allokeringsprocessen utmynnar i att de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utv\u00e4ljs, vilket bland annat baseras p\u00e5 organisationernas relevans och effektivitet enligt iakttagelser fr\u00e5n tidigare f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljning. Det nu aktuella st\u00f6det till Action Against Hunger (AAH) baseras p\u00e5 Sidas humanit\u00e4ra allokeringsprocess, som f\u00e4rdigst\u00e4lldes under slutet av 2017. \n\nAktuell insats bygger vidare p\u00e5 tidigare \u00e5rs st\u00f6d till AAH, som tidigare gick under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF). Sidas \u00e5rliga st\u00f6d till AAH bef\u00e4stes 2014 d\u00e5 ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett tre\u00e5rigt avtal, signerades. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6regicks av en djupdykande utv\u00e4rdering, vilken bland annat framlyfte AAH:s goda expertis och renomm\u00e9 inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngdes senare f\u00f6r att \u00e4ven inkludera 2017. Ett nytt tre\u00e5rigt avtal (2018-2020) f\u00f6resl\u00e5s nu f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en fortsatt strategisk ansats i relation och partnerskap med AAH. Det nu f\u00f6reslagna st\u00f6det avses kompletteras med ytterligare st\u00f6d genom st\u00f6rre \u00e4ndringar av insatsen, i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel (\u00a7 3.4.2), f\u00f6r \u00e5ren 2018-2020. Kompletterande medelstill\u00e4gg f\u00f6ruts\u00e4tter att riksdagen anvisar n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga finansiella medel samt baseras p\u00e5 bed\u00f6md relevans i kommande allokeringsprocesser. \n\nTotalt f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att 201 miljoner kronor allokeras till Action Against Hunger f\u00f6r implementeringen av humanit\u00e4ra hj\u00e4lpinsatser i initialt 18 l\u00e4nder.

I 13 av l\u00e4nderna sker finansiering i form av projektst\u00f6d, d\u00e4r Sidas st\u00f6d g\u00e5r till specifika projekt med tydlig information kring projektets inriktning samt hur st\u00f6det kommer att implementeras. \n\nF\u00f6r 2019 och 2020 f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att 13 miljoner kronor respektive 8 miljoner kronor allokeras till AAH f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra fler\u00e5riga st\u00f6d till tv\u00e5 av de ovan n\u00e4mnda projekten.

I \u00f6vriga fem l\u00e4nder har Sida f\u00f6r avsikt att i linje med den av regeringen antagna Grand Bargain, vilken \u00e4r en \u00f6verenskommelse som syftar till att effektivisera och minska kostnaderna av humanit\u00e4r hj\u00e4lp till n\u00f6dlidande, ge st\u00f6d i form av en programbaserad ansats. Detta \u00e4r en st\u00f6dform som ger AAH m\u00f6jlighet att flexibelt allokera st\u00f6det till ej f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda humanit\u00e4ra behov inom l\u00e4nderna. Detta under f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning att insatserna faller inom l\u00e4ndernas respektive FN-ledda humanit\u00e4ra responsplaner samt de programdokument AAH har inkommit med till Sida. \n\n3.\tRAPID RESPONSE MECHANISM. Av den initiala allokeringen utg\u00f6r 35 miljoner kronor st\u00f6d i form av modellen Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), vilket ger AAH flexibilitet att snabbt tillskjuta medel till nya insatser som syftar till att besvara pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, och f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra behov. Sida m\u00e5ste dock, enligt avtal, godk\u00e4nna AAH:s f\u00f6rslag p\u00e5 n\u00e4r och var RRM-medlen kan nyttjas, vilket kan g\u00f6ras inom 24 timmar. \n\n4.\tMETODST\u00d6D. 2,2 miljoner kronor av den initiala allokeringen g\u00e5r till ett metodst\u00f6d, vilket syftar till att st\u00e4rka datainsamling och analys kopplad till undern\u00e4ring i Afrikas horn. \n\n\n\nBAKGRUND\n\nAction Against Hunger (AAH) grundades i Paris, Frankrike, 1979 f\u00f6r att bland annat ge st\u00f6d till afghanska flyktingar i Pakistan samt matos\u00e4kra hush\u00e5ll i Uganda. AAH har sedan dess vuxit kontinuerligt, och utg\u00f6r i dag en av de st\u00f6rsta humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rerna inom sitt huvudmandat; det vill s\u00e4ga, nutrition och mats\u00e4kerhet. Action Against Hunger gick tidigare under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF), men valde att byta namn f\u00f6r att s\u00e4tta en mer internationell pr\u00e4gel p\u00e5 organisationen.\n\nUnder 1990-talet utvecklade AAH ett internationellt n\u00e4tverk, vars styrelse i dag best\u00e5r av medlemmarna AAH Frankrike (Sidas avtalspartner), AAH Indien, AAH Kanada, AAH Spanien, AAH Storbritannien och AAH USA. AAH:s internationella n\u00e4tverk delar en strategisk plan, och medlemmarna har gemensamt framtagit en rad principer, som till exempel neutralitet, transparens och icke-diskriminering, vilka de alla lyder under. Tillsammans har de ocks\u00e5 utarbetat ett gemensamt f\u00f6rh\u00e5llningss\u00e4tt till bland annat anti-korruptionsfr\u00e5gor. P\u00e5 medlemsniv\u00e5 har detta \u00f6versatts till separata anti-korruptionspolicys samt uppf\u00f6randekoder (code of conducts), som tillsammans med sina annex fastst\u00e4ller n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarnas nolltolerans mot sexuella \u00f6vergrepp och maktmissbruk. Ansvar och samording av AAH:s operativa verksamhet p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 har uppdelats mellan de tre medlemmarna AAH Frankrike, AAH Spanien och AAH USA: \n\nAAH FRANKRIKE (Sidas avtalspartner)\nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Centralafrikanska Republiken, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Djibouti, Elfenbenskusten, Etiopien, Indien, Irak, Jemen, Jordanien, Kamerun, Liberia, Madagaskar, Myanmar, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Tchad, Ukraina, Zimbabwe. \n\nAAH SPANIEN\nBolivia, Colombia, Egypten, Guinea, Libanon, Malawi, Mali, Mauretanien, Niger, Palestina, Peru, Senegal, Sudan, Syrien, S\u00f6dra Kaukasus, Turkiet.  \n\nAAH USA\nCambodia, Haiti, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Sydsudan, Tanzania, Uganda. \n\nDe olika n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarna \u00e4r separata juridiska personer, vilket inneb\u00e4r att Sidas medel per definition vidaref\u00f6rmedlas i insatser som implementeras av n\u00e5got av AAH Spaniens och AAH USA:s landkontor. F\u00f6r 2018 inneb\u00e4r det, per den initiala allokeringen, att 57,3 % av Sidas st\u00f6d stannar inom AAH Frankrike, samtidigt som 17,1 % vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till AAH Spanien och 24,1 % till AAH USA. Resterande 1,5 % av 2018 \u00e5rs intiala st\u00f6d vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till AAH Kanada f\u00f6r implementering av metodst\u00f6det SMART. \n\n\n\nVERKSAMHET OCH MERV\u00c4RDE \n\nAAH:s vision \u00e4r en v\u00e4rld fri fr\u00e5n hunger, d\u00e4r s\u00e5v\u00e4l barn som vuxna har tillr\u00e4ckligt med mat och vatten, samt andra n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga resurser, f\u00f6r att uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5lla ett v\u00e4rdigt liv. Organisationens huvudmandat ligger inom livr\u00e4ddande insatser som syftar till att utrota f\u00f6rekomsten av hunger genom att f\u00f6rebygga, uppt\u00e4cka och behandla undern\u00e4ring, samt att bem\u00f6ta de underliggande orsakerna till hunger.  \n\nAAH bed\u00f6ms av Sida ha en viktig expertis och kompetens inom den humanit\u00e4ra verksamheten att arbeta med fr\u00e5gor kring nutrition och sektorer i dess n\u00e4ra anslutning s\u00e5som livsmedelsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten och sanitet samt h\u00e4lsa.

Humanit\u00e4ra hj\u00e4lpinsatser kompletteras ofta med aktiviteter, som exempelvis utbildningstillf\u00e4llen inom sanitet och nutrition, vilka syftar till att st\u00e4rka utsatta m\u00e4nniskors motst\u00e5ndskraft. Sida har goda erfarenheter av AAH:s f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att snabbt svara p\u00e5 behov till f\u00f6ljd av pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt eskalerande kriser.\n\nAAH:s merv\u00e4rde som humanit\u00e4r partnerorganisation till Sida ligger i organisationens huvudmandat inom omr\u00e5det f\u00f6r nutrition, vilket kan p\u00e5visas genom att AAH: \n\nA.\tHar etablerad n\u00e4rvaro i majoriteten av v\u00e4rldens humanit\u00e4ra kriser.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn.

Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r.

Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation.

Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2.

D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia.

Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation.

Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia.

V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r.

Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation.

Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering.

MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2.

D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport.

Nuvarande fragmentering och brist p\u00e5 data och information g\u00f6r det sv\u00e5rt om inte om\u00f6jligt f\u00f6r Somaliska h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdsakt\u00f6rer att kostnadseffektivt planera, hantera och leverera kvalitetsh\u00e4lsov\u00e5rd \u00f6ver hela landet. Insatsen skall implementeras av SPIDER (Swedish Program for ICT in Developing Regions). SPIDER grundades 2004 p\u00e5 Sidas initiativ och \u00e4r idag ett oberoende centrum f\u00f6r expertis inom ICT f\u00f6r utveckling vid Stockholms Universitet. Sida har sedan etableringen av SPIDER fortsatt att tillhandah\u00e5lla ett fler\u00e5rigt icke-\u00f6ronm\u00e4rkt/k\u00e4rnst\u00f6d till SPIDER i till\u00e4gg till specifika projekt st\u00f6d. SPIDER fungerar som den svenska operativa motparten och r\u00e5dgivaren f\u00f6r ett antal Sida ICT f\u00f6r utveckling (ICT4D) projekt i Sida prioriterade l\u00e4nder. SPIDER mobiliserar ett n\u00e4tverk av svenska och internationella experter p\u00e5 informations- och kommunikationsteknik f\u00f6r utveckling f\u00f6r att hj\u00e4lpa utvecklingsl\u00e4nder anv\u00e4nda ICT som ett verktyg f\u00f6r att effektivt och strategiskt driva utvecklings- och fattigdomsminskningsm\u00e5l - i detta fall, h\u00e4lsa.\n\nF\u00f6r denna insats, f\u00f6resl\u00e5r SPIDER en initial 12-m\u00e5naders start-fas under vilken SPIDER kommer att genomf\u00f6ra granskning av nuvarande data och informationssituationen och kapaciteten i Somalia, analys av regionala behov, inklusive bed\u00f6mning av h\u00e4lsosystemet i de tv\u00e5 utvalda regionerna (Galmudug och Puntland ), rekrytering och utstationering av projektpersonal och kartl\u00e4ggning av relevanta akt\u00f6rer. De tv\u00e5 utvalda regionerna best\u00e4mdes av SPIDER i samr\u00e5d med det federala h\u00e4lsoministeriet i Somalia. De tv\u00e5 utvalda regionerna \u00e5terspeglar det nuvarande h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdssystemet i Somalia. Galmudug-regionen representerar ett av de svagaste h\u00e4lsosystemen med begr\u00e4nsad kapacitet och r\u00e4ckvidd. Galumudug-regionen kontrolleras ocks\u00e5 delvis av Al-Shabaab som g\u00f6r det sv\u00e5rt att f\u00e5 tillg\u00e5ng till kritisk m\u00f6dra-och barnh\u00e4lsov\u00e5rd. Puntland regionen \u00e5 andra sidan har ett av de mest utvecklade h\u00e4lsosystemen inom Somalias federala regering. Regionen \u00e4r ganska stabil och h\u00e4lsoministeriet har erfarenhet j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med Galmudug. SPIDER f\u00f6resl\u00e5r vidare att skapa ett centralt nav f\u00f6r datalagring och hantering i Mogadishu.\n\nSammanfattningsvis syftar projektet till att utforma, uppr\u00e4tta och leverera ett HMIS som \u00e4r l\u00e4mpligt f\u00f6r Somalias infrastruktur och folkh\u00e4lsobehov. Utvecklingen av HMIS \u00e4r en viktig fr\u00e5ga f\u00f6r den federala regeringen och prioriteringen \u00e4r inkluderad i den nationella h\u00e4lsostrategin.",

Gemensamt beh\u00f6ver de humanit\u00e4ra appellerna 22,5 miljarder kronor. De snabbt \u00f6kade humanit\u00e4ra behoven st\u00e4ller h\u00f6ga krav p\u00e5 dagens humanit\u00e4ra system, b\u00e5de operationellt och finansiellt.

D\u00e4rmed \u00e4r de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna, s\u00e5 kallade Country Based Pooled Funds (CBPF), av central betydelse f\u00f6r den humanit\u00e4ra responseffektiviteten.\n\nVad \u00e4r en CBPF/humanit\u00e4r landfond?\nEn CBPF \u00e4r en fond som uppr\u00e4ttas p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5, i vilken flertalet givare tills\u00e4tter resurser i en och samma fond. Beslut om f\u00f6rdelning av fondens medel sker p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5. P\u00e5 grund av CBPFens n\u00e4rhet till responsen och h\u00f6g grad av lokal f\u00f6rankring har den en stark tradition av att st\u00f6dja lokala akt\u00f6rer med goda tilltr\u00e4desm\u00f6jligheter samt lokal kunskap. N\u00e5got som visat sig \u00e4n viktigare de senaste \u00e5ren, pga av det \u00f6kade antalet konflikter i v\u00e4rlden. Under 2017 utgick 23% av det totala st\u00f6det direkt till lokala partners.  \n\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) har huvudansvaret f\u00f6r dessa fonder. OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) \u00e4r formellt ansvarig f\u00f6r etablerandet och avvecklandet av dessa fonder, samt f\u00f6r deras operationella effektivitet. P\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 \u00e4r den av ERC utsedda humanit\u00e4re koordinatorn (HC) ansvarig f\u00f6r respektive fond. Den humanit\u00e4re koordinatorns ansvar \u00e4r av central betydelse d\u00e5 det st\u00e4rker den humanit\u00e4ra samordningen i f\u00e4lt, vilket \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt pga av det st\u00e4ndigt \u00f6kade antalet humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rer. Detta regleras i de Globala riktlinjerna vilka \u00e4r obligatoriska f\u00f6r samtliga humanit\u00e4ra landfonder. De Globla riktlinjerna som \u00e4r obligatoriska att f\u00f6lja f\u00f6r samtliga fonder lanserades av OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef (ERC) i februari 2015. Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och st\u00e4rkts p\u00e5 ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen st\u00e4rker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppf\u00f6ljning p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5).  \n\nGivare har en r\u00e5dgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen \u201dAdvisory Board (AB)\u201d samt det globala r\u00e5dgivande forumet \u201dPooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, som b\u00e5da sk\u00f6ts av OCHA.

Gemensamt beh\u00f6ver de humanit\u00e4ra appellerna 22,5 miljarder kronor. De snabbt \u00f6kade humanit\u00e4ra behoven st\u00e4ller h\u00f6ga krav p\u00e5 dagens humanit\u00e4ra system, b\u00e5de operationellt och finansiellt.

D\u00e4rmed \u00e4r de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna, s\u00e5 kallade Country Based Pooled Funds (CBPF), av central betydelse f\u00f6r den humanit\u00e4ra responseffektiviteten.\n\nVad \u00e4r en CBPF/humanit\u00e4r landfond?\nEn CBPF \u00e4r en fond som uppr\u00e4ttas p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5, i vilken flertalet givare tills\u00e4tter resurser i en och samma fond. Beslut om f\u00f6rdelning av fondens medel sker p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5. P\u00e5 grund av CBPFens n\u00e4rhet till responsen och h\u00f6g grad av lokal f\u00f6rankring har den en stark tradition av att st\u00f6dja lokala akt\u00f6rer med goda tilltr\u00e4desm\u00f6jligheter samt lokal kunskap. N\u00e5got som visat sig \u00e4n viktigare de senaste \u00e5ren, pga av det \u00f6kade antalet konflikter i v\u00e4rlden. Under 2017 utgick 23% av det totala st\u00f6det direkt till lokala partners.  \n\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) har huvudansvaret f\u00f6r dessa fonder. OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) \u00e4r formellt ansvarig f\u00f6r etablerandet och avvecklandet av dessa fonder, samt f\u00f6r deras operationella effektivitet. P\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 \u00e4r den av ERC utsedda humanit\u00e4re koordinatorn (HC) ansvarig f\u00f6r respektive fond. Den humanit\u00e4re koordinatorns ansvar \u00e4r av central betydelse d\u00e5 det st\u00e4rker den humanit\u00e4ra samordningen i f\u00e4lt, vilket \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt pga av det st\u00e4ndigt \u00f6kade antalet humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rer. Detta regleras i de Globala riktlinjerna vilka \u00e4r obligatoriska f\u00f6r samtliga humanit\u00e4ra landfonder. De Globla riktlinjerna som \u00e4r obligatoriska att f\u00f6lja f\u00f6r samtliga fonder lanserades av OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef (ERC) i februari 2015. Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och st\u00e4rkts p\u00e5 ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen st\u00e4rker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppf\u00f6ljning p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5).  \n\nGivare har en r\u00e5dgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen \u201dAdvisory Board (AB)\u201d samt det globala r\u00e5dgivande forumet \u201dPooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, som b\u00e5da sk\u00f6ts av OCHA.

        "description": "In summary, this project proposes to contribute to three core aspects of Camp Coordination and Camp Management in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District, including leading essential coordination functions, developing and maintaining camp infrastructures that have been devastated by recent flooding.establishing/Rehabilitating/Enhancing drainage systems in IDP sites through incentivized workdays carried out by site-level site maintenance committees, and promoting humanitarian accountability through the operation of feedback and complaint mechanisms. Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.",

        "description": "The current triple effects of floods, locust infestation and COVID-19 Pandemic coupled with heavy rains in the Ethiopian highlands have led to increasing water levels in the Shabelle and Juba rivers in southern Somalia, causing widespread flooding in low-lying riverine communities and displacing more than 270,000 people out of their homes, The project is in line with Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) Reserve and will provide integrated life-saving emergency primary health care and nutrition needs of flood-affected women, men, boys and girls of proposed project targets in Jowhar district. ARD is proposing  6-month integrated Health and Nutrition project targeting flood affected populations in Jowhar district reaching a total of 14,600  persons including 2,950 women, 2,180 Men, 5,025 boys and 4,445 girls) \nHEALTH: The proposed project will support two mobile (IERT) in Jowhar district. ARD plans to deliver an integrated package of promotive, preventive and curative maternal, newborn amp child health services and scale-up outbreak early warning and response (EWAR) and case management of epidemic prone diseases through IERT response team as part of the efforts to support the flood affected communities in Jowhar. The project aims to establish mobile clinics in Jowhar IDP and host community\u2019s sites and scale up the health care through skilled health professionals. ARD through this project will provide regular medical supplies and life-saving drugs to established health facilities, establish referral mechanisms and   improve the coverage of measles vaccinations, support safe motherhood and reproductive health while also ensuring readiness to prevent and respond to outbreaks such as malaria, measles or AWD/Cholera and promote health update through health education and beneficiary sensitization\nNUTRITION: The proposed nutrition activities will be integrated with the health interventions with the aim of addressing underlying causes of high levels malnutrition as well as to enable early identification of SAM cases for treatment in 2 mobile and 1 fixed OTPs and 1 SC) in targeted IDPs and host community in the floods affected areas in Jowhar district. This program will establish a strong community network through competent community nutrition volunteers for early detection/case finding and referral of children and pregnant and lactating mothers with acute malnutrition. In addition to the treatment of acute malnutrition, the project will be promoting positive infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practice by providing IYCF promotion and counselling. ARD is strong partner for the nutrition cluster and therefore, will have close coordination with other partners in the district for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses. Through this project, a total 12,420(2,950 women, 5,025 girls and 4,445 boys) floods affected individuals in Jowhar will have access to a package of Emergency lifesaving integrated health and nutrition services in six months\u2019 period. The mobile team will provide comprehensive community screening, identification, treatment  and referral services from community, IDP areas to the fixed outpatient therapeutic program(OTP) and Stabilization Center (SC) to improve access to the integrated package for the vulnerable community prioritizing rapid referral of the most critical cases (priority will be given to under 5 children and pregnant and lactating women), it shall also capacity building of nutrition staff on IMAM/IYCF services, infant young child feeding best practices (IYCF. Referral of malnourished children with complicated cases will be done to the Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) centers integrated with primary health care services managed by ARD and other actors in the program areas thus providing more holistic opportunity to the target beneficiaries.",

        "description": "Displacement, cramped living conditions and other related stressors following flooding all serve to exacerbate tensions and increase violence in the home and in communities, with women and girls most at risk. With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries. Approximately 50 (20 girls and women) will be engaged in GBV safety audit and action planning in their communities. 4,000 (1,220girls,1,260 women, 800 boys and 720 men) will be reached through door to door community outreach and over 25,000 reached through GBV radio advocacy and awareness creation. 450 dignity kits and 250 emergency support kits and 2000 sanitary kits will be distributed. Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management. Through the two WGSS, a total of 800(400 women and girls) will be reached through weekly GBV prevention and response sessions.",

        "description": "In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region. There were more than 5 accidents with fatalities and casualties in the Danyiile district alone this year which includes children and persons with no knowledge of Explosive ordinances.\n\nIn Afgooye about 191,143 persons standing as 100% of the population severity level no 3 described as degrading which puts them highly in need of protection against the explosive substances. Of these 56,000 are IDPs from the floods and other natural calamities while 135,431 are host communities according to the data recently shared by the protection cluster on HNO.\n\nExplosive ordinances contamination presents a barrier to development, and encumber livelihood activities particularly it affected IDPs, returnees, animal herders, and the rural poor families.",

These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.

In order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in the affected areas and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called 'Kobo Tool box' to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with 'Do No Harm' principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $145 (80% or $116 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $29 as the second installment) per HH will be provided for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . A predetermined beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . These criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use M and E tools that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. This action shall deliver urgent humanitarian flood response assistance in the form of cash for NFIs and ESKs to 1,350 HHs (8,100 individuals) in district Belet Weyne.\n\nTo ensure that the assistance provided is used for intended purposes, NRC s will coordinate all components of this action with the community to ensure thorough sensitization and beneficiary participation  for individuals and the community at large .A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash and while also assess the impact of the response, generate and document lessons learned for dissemination to multiple stakeholders.",

The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

        "description": "Merka communities face scarcity of safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods coupled with the effect of pandemic since march 2020. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management.

NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation. The synergy between the 3 sectoral partners will ensure sound management of the program, greater impact, efficiency, and more cost-effective operations. The project target sites includes the following\n\nDeynille - Yaagle camp, Igadabagey, Bacaad, Alle suge, Shidane k7, walaalaha, Wanaagsan, Ramaas, Taad, Iskaashi IDP camps\nKaxda - Owbaale 1, Jimale 1, Bananey, Waraanle, Rabisuge, and Mudan IDP camps.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

OPC \u00e4r f\u00f6rankrat i den internationella arbetarr\u00f6relsen i de specifika landkontexter d\u00e4r projekten genomf\u00f6rs via lokala partnerorganisationer. Organisationen bildades i sin nuvarande form 1992 som den svenska arbetarr\u00f6relsens samarbetsorganisation f\u00f6r internationell verksamhet och opinionsbildning. OPC \u00e4r en av Sidas strategiska partnerorganisationer (SPO) och har ett p\u00e5g\u00e5ende samarbete med Sida inom regeringens CSO-strategi 2016 - 2022. OPC har \u00e4ven ett flertal st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n andra samarbetsstrategier. Det \u00f6vergripande programm\u00e5let \u00e4r \"st\u00e4rka civila samh\u00e4llet och progressiv utveckling f\u00f6r demokrati, j\u00e4mlikhet och h\u00e5llbarhet.\" \n\nOPC arbetar integrerat med tre huvudomr\u00e5den inom det internationella utvecklingssamarbetet: \n- folkligt deltagande \n- fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete \n- partipolitisk organisering (st\u00f6ds ej inom CSO-strategin.) \n\nOPC samarbetar i sina projekt med 27 olika medlemsorganisationer (MO) tex ABF, LO och Unga \u00d6rnar. Ett projekt innefattar oftast \u00e4ven samarbete med en lokal organisation d.v.s. en partnerorganisation (PO).\n\nSidas bed\u00f6mning \u00e4r att OPC har en unik kompetens och l\u00e5ng praktisk erfarenhet av demokratiutveckling och fattigdomsbek\u00e4mpning i Sverige och internationellt. Med expertis i st\u00e4rkandet av r\u00e4ttigheter, organisering och fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete, utg\u00f6r OPC en v\u00e4rdefull partner i samarbetet med Sida. \n\nOPC har sju lokalkontor i Asien, S\u00f6dra Afrika och p\u00e5 V\u00e4stra Balkan. Kontoren best\u00e5r av 1-3 anst\u00e4llda. OPC arbetar n\u00e4ra sina partnerorganisationer och \u00e4r uppskattade i dessa partnerskap. OPC bygger sitt arbete kring internationell solidaritet och erbjuder sina samarbetspartner kontakter inom internationella n\u00e4tverk. OPC genomf\u00f6r kurser om bl.a. kvinnors r\u00e4ttigheter, organisationsfrihet samt st\u00e4rker marginaliserade grupper om hur de kan utkr\u00e4va sina r\u00e4ttigheter. De st\u00e4rker sina partnerorganisationers kapacitet s\u00e5 att dessa i sin tur effektivare ska kunna f\u00f6retr\u00e4da sina medlemmar. St\u00f6det ska leda till att partnerorganisationerna kan verka som demokratiska f\u00f6rebilder och p\u00e5verka or\u00e4ttvisa samh\u00e4llsstrukturer.\n\nOPC OCH SIDAS SAMARBETE\nUnder tidigare avtalsperioder och under den nu p\u00e5g\u00e5ende avtalsperioden har Sida konstaterat att OPC vidareutvecklats inom flera omr\u00e5den. Sida har bl.a. noterat att OPC st\u00e4rkt sina system f\u00f6r intern styrning och kontroll samt att programmen \u00e4r mer logiskt sammanh\u00e4ngande. Det \u00e4r framsteg som Sida ser mycket positivt p\u00e5. Samtidigt har Sida ocks\u00e5  bed\u00f6mt en del omr\u00e5den som mindre tillfredsst\u00e4llande, bl.a. bristande f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att f\u00f6lja upp avvikelse\u00e4renden och l\u00e5ngsam omst\u00e4llning fr\u00e5n projektst\u00f6d till k\u00e4rnst\u00f6d. Vad g\u00e4ller integreringen av de tematiska perspektiven s\u00e5 har tydliga framsteg gjorts men \u00e4n \u00e5terst\u00e5r mycket arbete, s\u00e4rskilt vad g\u00e4ller milj\u00f6 och klimat samt j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet.\n\nANS\u00d6KAN F\u00d6R 2020-2024\nDen h\u00e4r insatsen avses finansieras under \"CSO-strategin 2016-2022\" samt \"Myanmarstrategin 2018-2022.\" Ans\u00f6kan inkluderar flera program som ryms inom ett \u00f6vergripande program kopplat till CSO-strategin samt ett landprogram f\u00f6r Myanmar. Det \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let f\u00f6r programmet \u00e4r att st\u00e4rka civila samh\u00e4llet och progressiv utveckling f\u00f6r demokrati, j\u00e4mlikhet och h\u00e5llbarhet. Ans\u00f6kan baserar sig p\u00e5 OPC:s internationella strategi 2020-2025. OPC:s f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringsteori utg\u00e5r fr\u00e5n fyra olika slags akt\u00f6rer: beslutsfattare, r\u00e4ttighetsb\u00e4rare, n\u00e4tverk/allianser och partnerorganisationer. Programmens fokus \u00e4r hur dessa akt\u00f6rer kan samverka f\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 progressiv utveckling.  \n\nVad OPC menar med \"progressiv utveckling\" kommer till uttryck i OPC:s fem politiska prioriteringar som \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: \n1. Motverka hot mot demokrati och m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter\n2. St\u00e4rka j\u00e4mlikhet och arbetsvillkor - bygga nya allianser and arbeta f\u00f6r progressiv politik\n3. H\u00e5llbarhet utifr\u00e5n r\u00e4ttvis omst\u00e4llning - motverka klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar\n4. Fr\u00e4mja fred och dialog - minska v\u00e4pnad konflikt och social oro\n5. Mots\u00e4tta sig tillbakag\u00e5ngen - \u00f6kad j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet\n\nDessa fem prioriteringar \u00e4r utg\u00e5ngspunkten f\u00f6r programmen. OPC arbetar med beteende- och systemf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring inom de fem politiska prioriteringarna. Enligt OPC leder beteendef\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna till att samh\u00e4llen och system blir mer demokratiska, fredliga, m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter respekteras i h\u00f6gre grad och social och ekonomisk oj\u00e4mlikhet mellan m\u00e4nniskor minskar. F\u00f6r\u00e4ndringen gagnar de grupper som har minst resurser, s\u00e4mst m\u00f6jligheter, lever i st\u00f6rst os\u00e4kerhet och har minst makt, d.v.s. de allra fattigaste. \n\nOPC st\u00f6ttar sina partnerorganisationer i deras ambition att \u00e5stadkomma samh\u00e4llsf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring. Vissa av partnerorganisationerna arbetar direkt med de allra fattigaste t.ex. i Myanmar, Sydafrika och Palestina, medan andra arbetar mot m\u00e5lgrupper inom sektorer som inte tillh\u00f6r de allra fattigaste t.ex. arbetare . Gemensamt f\u00f6r dessa insatser \u00e4r arbetss\u00e4ttet; de samarbetar genom att erbjuda organisering. \u00c4ven de partnerorganisationer som inte arbetar direkt med de allra fattigaste arbetar f\u00f6r f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring som gynnar de allra fattigaste. De grupper OPC framf\u00f6rallt fokuserar p\u00e5 \u00e4r kvinnor, marginaliserade grupper samt arbetare. \n\nSidas bed\u00f6mning \u00e4r att OPC har en relevant och logisk bredd av aktiviteter, fr\u00e5n st\u00e4rkande av r\u00e4ttigheter, utkr\u00e4vande av r\u00e4ttigheter och organisering, till strategiskt p\u00e5verkansarbete f\u00f6r att f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra lagstiftning och andra samh\u00e4llsstrukturer. \n\nI ans\u00f6kan planerar OPC verksamhet i ca 20 l\u00e4nder, inom fem regionala program och ett tematiskt program samt tre program som fokuserar p\u00e5 metodutveckling och kvalitetss\u00e4kring. Verksamheten f\u00f6rdelas p\u00e5 ca 120 partnerorganisationer, varav ca 1/3 bedrivs helt eller delvis av medlemsorganisationerna. OPC har budgetansvar f\u00f6r de resterande st\u00f6den till partnerorganisationer. N\u00e5gra av partnerorganisationerna kommer fasas ut medan andra nya organisationer fasas in under den kommande avtalsperioden. Omfattningen av verksamheten, b\u00e5de i form av inneh\u00e5ll och storlek, \u00e4r i huvudsak en forts\u00e4ttning av p\u00e5g\u00e5ende verksamhet. De planerade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna presenteras under stycke \"F\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar fr\u00e5n p\u00e5g\u00e5ende program.\"\n\nM\u00e5len \u00e4r formulerade p\u00e5 en \u00f6vergripande niv\u00e5 eftersom de ska inkludera verksamheten i 20 l\u00e4nder med sina specifika kontexter. M\u00e5len \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 formulerade mer som \u00f6nskade riktningar och tillst\u00e5nd \u00e4n som specifika situationer vid programmets slut. Detta beror fr\u00e4mst p\u00e5 att m\u00e5len syftar till att \u00e4ndra beteenden och attityder. Alla programmen kommer inte att fokusera p\u00e5 samma politiska prioriterade fr\u00e5gor men tillsammans bidrar alla programmen till de fem politiska prioriteringarna. M\u00e5lformuleringarna och indikatorer f\u00f6r verksamheten har formulerats av partnerorganisationerna och medlemsorganisationerna tillsammans med OPC, i workshops i respektive region. \n\nMilj\u00f6 och klimat, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, konfliktk\u00e4nslighet samt anti-korruption \u00e4r perspektiv som kommer att integreras i alla program. Med bl.a. personalf\u00f6rst\u00e4rkning avser OPC att arbeta med kompetensh\u00f6jande insatser, och med metodutveckling f\u00f6r b\u00e4ttre verktyg och strategier inom perspektiven. \n\nEtt av OPC:s huvudsyften \u00e4r att st\u00f6tta medlemsorganisationernas utvecklingssamarbete. F\u00f6r att ta vara p\u00e5 medlemsorganisationernas intresse och engagemang erbjuder OPC medlemmarna olika m\u00f6jligheter att delta i samarbetet med partnerorganisationer. OPC har tre olika projektstrukturer: \n\n- Fullt ansvar f\u00f6r ett projekt; medlemsorganisation har ansvar f\u00f6r alla delar av ett projekt, fr\u00e5n planering till utv\u00e4rdering. OPC vidaref\u00f6rmedlar medel till medlemsorganisationen samt kvalitetss\u00e4krar projektet. \n- Deltagande i projekt; OPC hanterar budgetansvaret. I de h\u00e4r projekten kan medlemsorganisationernas specialkunskaper i folkligt deltagande, fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete och partipolitisk organisering komma verksamheten till del \u00e4ven i de fall d\u00e5 den svenska organisationen saknar kapacitet att hantera budgetansvaret.\n- Fadder f\u00f6r ett projekt; medlemsorganisationen \u00e4r fadder f\u00f6r projektet och bidrar finansiellt till det. Den deltar i projektaktiviteter medan OPC ansvarar f\u00f6r projektets alla delar. \n\nSida anser att ett av OPC:s merv\u00e4rden \u00e4r att partnerorganisationerna kan dra nytta av medlemsorganisationernas erfarenheter, kunskap och n\u00e4tverk. \n\nBUDGET OCH ANS\u00d6KT BELOPP\nAns\u00f6kan, inklusive medel fr\u00e5n b\u00e5de CSO-strategin, Myanmarstrategin samt OPC:s egeninsats, har en total budget p\u00e5 613 208 006 SEK. Beloppet inkluderar \u00e4ven 2 000 000 SEK f\u00f6r verksamhet \u00e5r 2020 i Nordmakedonien. Under beredningen besl\u00f6ts det att insatsen i Nordmakedonien hanteras separat av den bilaterala strategin. Ans\u00f6kans reviderade total budget \u00e4r d\u00e4rf\u00f6r 611 208 006. Fr\u00e5n Sida s\u00f6ker OPC d\u00e4rmed ett bidrag p\u00e5 totalt 568 290 850 SEK f\u00f6r 2020-2024, varav det beloppet fr\u00e5n CSO-strategin \u00e4r 486 132 334 SEK. Egeninsatsen \u00e4r 10%. OPC ans\u00f6ker om en stor budget\u00f6kning, 21% av \u00e5rlig genomsnittlig budget under nuvarande avtalsperiod. F\u00f6r att visa p\u00e5 ett scenario med l\u00e4gre budget, inkom OPC i november med ett underlag d\u00e4r ans\u00f6kt belopp fr\u00e5n CSO-strategin var 471 157 666 SEK. Underlaget indikerar minskade ambitioner inom flera av de presenterade omst\u00e4llningarna i ans\u00f6kan. \n\nSida bed\u00f6mer det rimligt att OPC ans\u00f6ker om en h\u00f6gre budget i och med de f\u00f6reslagna f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna inom framf\u00f6rallt metodutveckling och intern kontroll. Sida bed\u00f6mer dock att den nuvarande verksamheten och de planerade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna kan hanteras med en mindre anslagsvolym, \u00e4n vad OPC ans\u00f6kt om. En del av de f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar som planeras har varit f\u00f6rem\u00e5l f\u00f6r m\u00e5ng\u00e5rig dialog mellan Sida och OPC och Sida bed\u00f6mer att OPC hittills inte har gjort de framsteg som f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntats. Sida anser att det \u00e4r av stor betydelse att OPC forts\u00e4tter att prioritera de presenterade omst\u00e4llningarna, \u00e4ven om den ans\u00f6kta budgeten inte beviljas i sin helhet.\n\nF\u00d6R\u00c4NDRINGAR FR\u00c5N P\u00c5G\u00c5ENDE PROGRAM\nDet f\u00f6reslagna programmet \u00e4r i stort en f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngning av det p\u00e5g\u00e5ende programmet avseende partnerorganisationer och verksamhetsl\u00e4nder. Flera av programmen \u00e4r omstrukturerade. OPC planerar f\u00f6ljande f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar inom programperioden: \n- \u00f6kade personalkostnader med 10%; f\u00f6r att vara b\u00e4ttre rustad att bedriva verksamhet i sv\u00e5ra kontexter, st\u00e4rka kapaciteten f\u00f6r internkontroll, metodst\u00f6d, och s\u00e4kerhetsfr\u00e5gor samt st\u00f6d till medlemsorganisationer i sitt samarbete med partnerorganisationer. Dessutom kr\u00e4vs \u00f6kade resurser f\u00f6r arbetet med milj\u00f6- och klimatomst\u00e4llning. Dessa f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar leder till att OPC st\u00e4rker sin f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att hantera sidamedel, b\u00e4ttre kan m\u00f6ta behov hos partner- och medlemsorganisationer samt st\u00e4rka sin f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att anpassa sig till nya globala f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar.  \n- \u00f6kad lokal n\u00e4rvaro i samarbetsl\u00e4nderna; antalet anst\u00e4llda vid lokalkontoren \u00f6kar f\u00f6r ge ett mer kvalitativt, och kostnadseffektivt st\u00f6d till  partner- och medlemsorganisationer tex ska fler lokala kontor \u00e4n idag ha en controller. \n- \u00f6kat finansiellt st\u00f6d till partnerorganisationer. \n- f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrad resultathantering; fr\u00e5n traditionell redovisning med f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda resultat och indikatorer till adaptiv management, d\u00e4r indikatorer ska v\u00e4gleda uppf\u00f6ljningen av verksamheten.

Sedan flera \u00e5r tillbaka har Sida uppmuntrat OPC att s\u00f6ka medel fr\u00e5n andra finansi\u00e4rer. OPC:s beroende av sidafinansiering \u00e4r fortsatt mycket stor.

Dessa var: j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, milj\u00f6 och klimat samt konflikt. Uppf\u00f6ljningarna genomf\u00f6rdes av sidar\u00e5dgivare och Sidas help desks. \n\nOPC:s ans\u00f6kan har beretts av en beredningsgrupp i en samberedning. F\u00f6ljande r\u00e5dgivare och/eller funktioner har ing\u00e5tt i gruppen: handl\u00e4ggare med ansvar f\u00f6r st\u00f6d till OPC, controller, resultatstyrning, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, handl\u00e4ggare med fokus p\u00e5 bist\u00e5ndseffektivitet och jurist. Beredningsgruppen har haft regelbundna avst\u00e4mningar i syfte att belysa OPC:s verksamhet och organisation utifr\u00e5n olika infallsvinklar och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra bed\u00f6mningen i sin helhet. Under beredningsprocessen har Sida haft flera m\u00f6ten med OPC, b\u00e5de i grupp och bilaterala mellan r\u00e5dgivare. Synpunkter har efterfr\u00e5gats fr\u00e5n relevanta svenska utlandsmyndigheter samt andra enheter p\u00e5 Sida som hanterar avtal med OPC.",

        "description": "Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) \u00e4r ett program-baserat partnerskap som inkluderar de minst utvecklade l\u00e4nder (MUL), givare och internationella organisationer. M\u00e5let \u00e4r att st\u00f6dja MUL att vara mer aktiva akt\u00f6rer inom det globala handelssystemet genom att hj\u00e4lpa dem att minska deras hinder inom handelssektorn. P\u00e5 detta s\u00e4tt arbetar EIF programmet mot ett \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5l f\u00f6r att fr\u00e4mja ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt och h\u00e5llbar utveckling. I dagsl\u00e4get best\u00e5r EIF av 23 givare, 6 multilaterala organisationer (IMF, ITC, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World Bank), 2 observat\u00f6rer (UNIDO och UNWTO) och 51 l\u00e4nder (48 MUL och 3 l\u00e4nder som nyligen l\u00e4mnade MUL kategorin). \n\nSida har gett st\u00f6d till EIF sedan 2009. St\u00f6det har uppg\u00e5tt till 120 MSEK f\u00f6r implementering av EIF fas 1 som p\u00e5g\u00e5r fram tills 2017. Den f\u00f6reslagna insatsen inneb\u00e4r att st\u00f6dja EIF:s implementering av fas 2 med 100 MSEK under \u00e5ren 2017-2021. Hela tidsperioden av EIF fas 2 omfattar \u00e5ren 2016-2022 och insatsens totala indikativa budget ligger p\u00e5 274-320 MUSD.\n\nEIF:s syfte \u00e4r of\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat i fas 2 och syftar till att st\u00f6dja MUL att: (1) integrera handel i nationella utvecklingsstrategier, (2) uppr\u00e4tta de strukturer som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att samordna leveransen av handelsrelaterat tekniskt bist\u00e5nd, och (3) bygga upp handelskapacitet, vilket \u00e4ven omfattar att ta itu med kritiska begr\u00e4nsningar p\u00e5 utbudssidan. \n\nFokus inom EIF \u00e4r kapacitetsuppbyggnad inom handelsfr\u00e5gor av MUL och framtagande av behovsanalyser, s\u00e5 kallade Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS). D\u00e4refter tar man fram landspecifika \u00e5tg\u00e4rdsmatriser i syfte att kunna identifiera akt\u00f6rer och finansi\u00e4rer som kan genomf\u00f6ra insatserna. I vissa fall implementeras och finansieras prioriterade \u00e5tg\u00e4rder direkt inom ramen f\u00f6r EIF. Exempel p\u00e5 s\u00e5dana prioriterade \u00e5tg\u00e4rder fr\u00e5n fas 1 \u00e4r \"High Value Silk\" projektet som syftar till att \u00f6ka konkurrenskraften hos den kambodjanska silke sektorn f\u00f6r att skapa arbetstillf\u00e4llen s\u00e4rskilt f\u00f6r kvinnor, st\u00f6d f\u00f6r anslutning till WTO och kapacitetsuppbyggnad f\u00f6r handelsinstitutioner, regeringstj\u00e4nstem\u00e4n osv. Vidare syftar EIF programmet till att st\u00e4rka givarnas st\u00f6d till landets egen handelsagenda. MUL kan anv\u00e4nda EIF som en mekanism f\u00f6r att samordna givarst\u00f6det och tillf\u00f6r mer resurser inom deras handelsagenda, medan givarna kan ansluta sig till EIF som en mekanism f\u00f6r att leverera p\u00e5 deras \u00e5taganden inom handelsfr\u00e5gan. EIF:s aktiviteter finansieras genom en multi-donor trust fund.\n\nEIF:s globala f\u00f6rvaltningsstruktur best\u00e5r av EIF styrkommitt\u00e9n, EIF styrelsen, EIF sekretariatet och en fondf\u00f6rvaltare. EIF:s styrkommitt\u00e9 fungerar som ett \u00f6vergripande ledningsorgan, medan EIF:s styrelse \u00e4r det beslutande organet f\u00f6r EIF-programmet och ger strategisk tillsyn. Styrelsen best\u00e5r av en representant fr\u00e5n varje multilateral organisation (IMF, ITC, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World Bank), tre representanter fr\u00e5n de minst utvecklade l\u00e4nderna och tre representanter fr\u00e5n givargruppen. EIF:s sekretariat \u00e4r den genomf\u00f6randepartner/operativa f\u00f6rvaltaren av EIF-programmet och \u00e4r en del av WTO:s huvudkontor i Geneve, Schweiz. UNOPS regionala kontor i Geneve fungerar som fond/finansiell f\u00f6rvaltare f\u00f6r EIF fas 2 och \u00e4r Sidas avtalspartner. \n\nP\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 leder en nationell EIF fokalpunkt sj\u00e4lva EIF processen i landet, en EIF donor facilitator arbetar tillsammans med EIF fokalpunkten f\u00f6r att underl\u00e4tta givarsamordningen och EIF:s nationella styrkommitt\u00e9 \u00e4r ett forum f\u00f6r beslutsfattande och samordning mellan statliga parter inom handel, den privata sektorn, det civila samh\u00e4llet och givarna i det specifika landet.",

        "description": "Decentralisation in Somaliland is still in its early stages. While District Councils are mandated to provide services to citizens, there is still an unclear delineation of roles and responsibilities, as most sectors are (in practice) not yet decentralised from the line ministries and in many cases delivery been taken over by NGOs. Furthermore, there is a palpable mismatch between the responsibilities allocated to districts and the (financial and human) resources they have.\n\nThe Association of Local Government Authorities of Somaliland (ALGASL) was established in 2006 by the mayors of 10 district councils. ALGASL aims to build strong local governments and support decentralisation, benefiting local communities, including marginalized groups such as women, youth and IDPs. At present, ALGASL has 10 paying members out of the 23 districts with elected district councils. Though ALGASL has potential, the association is constrained by a lack of human and financial resources, which hinders its ability to fulfill its mandate and attract additional members.\n\nIf strengthened, ALGASL can play a pivotal role in working towards more legitimate local governments, because of its mandate to lobby and advocate for the interests of districts and to build their capacity. It is a highly relevant linchpin between central and local government, can provide nationwide outreach and can promote exchange of experience among districts through its platform function.",

        "description": "IOM MIDA Finnsom IV project focuses on contributing to improved health outcomes in Somaliland and particularly its remote regions. To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three out\nputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Local health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

        "description": "Some 1.5 billion people, half of the world\u2019s poor, live in fragile settings where the government is unable or unwilling to fulfill its core responsibilities to protect and care for its citizens. In such fragile settings, often characterized by variable levels of violent conflict, perspectives for stability and sustainable inclusive development - key priorities of the Dutch Government - continue to be extremely bleak. Whereas each fragile setting is unique, a broad international consensus exists on the multiple and complex causes that need to be addressed for a transition out of fragility. Among these, establishing inclusive governance processes is considered essential. A key obstacle for achieving stability and sustainable development in fragile settings is the structural exclusion of segments of society from local, district level and national governance processes. Our theory of change (TOC) addresses this with a focus on inclusive governance processes, referring to the extent to which governance processes provide space to overcome the systematic exclusion of disadvantaged groups seeking to participate in decision making. Therefore this strategic partnership\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to inclusive and effective governance processes in fragile settings. Specific target and impact groups may vary country by country and will be determined on the basis of thorough analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of women in governance processes is key to stability and development in all countries and therefore crosscuts all program interventions.",

As part of lessons learnt in late 2019 during which Somalia has experienced one of the most devastating floods in history, AVORD will ensure that relief items are readily available for immediate distribution to affected households, as needed. \n\nUnder the proposed initiative, 5,650 NFI kits will be distributed to stressed communities in humanitarian crisis in Baidoa including the newly arrived and evicted households. The target group include 8,136 men, 10,848 women, 4,068 boys and 4,068 girls from the IDP community and 2,034 men, 2,712 women, 1,017 boys and 1,017 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 1,017 men, 1,356 women, 508 boys and 509 girls will be targeted based on disability. In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain critical relief items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Where market conditions allow based on survey data, AVORD will adapt a Cash-based approach to implementation otherwise, an in-kind, direct distribution modality will be adapted. Disbursement of relief items will be made in close coordination with the shelter cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In each distribution, priority will be given to most vulnerable households in humanitarian emergency including the disabled, the chronically-ill, female headed households and families with the largest number of children under the age of 5. Full beneficiary details such as contact information will be captured throughout the process to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. Within 4 to 8 weeks of each distribution, a Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in the region and with other humanitarian partners including NRC and DRC with whom AVORD has signed a memorandum of cooperation, to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

In this case, HINNA is planning to use one of two either voucher distribution or direct distribution of ESK kits and NFI items, but it will depend on the context to reduce any risk that may rise.   \nThe main objective of the project is to ensure that 16,182 persons (2,697 HHs) of newly displaced, evictees and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,697 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,697 NFI kits to 2,697 households (16,182 persons -2,186 men, 3246 women, 4315 boys, and 6435 girls).

They will be distributed to newly arrived IDPs, protracted IDPs and affected host who did not receive any assistance in 2019 or early 2020 and mainly affected by flood. The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) living in the IDP site reside in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that jeopardize their physical security, privacy, and from vagaries of nature and diseases. \n\nUnder this project, HAPEN will distribute 3954 NFIs and 3954 ESKs as in-kind to 9 IDP site in Gedo region Dollow: (Kabasa = 655, Qansahley = 550, Host 100), Luuq: Jazeera =314, Xero kowad= 470 and Boyle=420 Host =100), and Garbahrey: (Towfiq =270, Tula qorah =345, Hashi Weer =380, Tafta taag =250 and Host 100).\n\nBeneficiaries will be selected through a participatory process driven by a representative project and site management committees while ensuring marginalized groups interests are catered for and vulnerable approach, considering issues such as women-headed and child-headed households, orphans, disabled, the old among and new arrivals, protracted, and distribution.\n\nThe proposed intervention targets 3654 IDP HHs (21,924 IDP persons) and 300 IDP host HHs (1,800) in Dollow, Garbaharey and Luuq. The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. \n\nFollowing a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs. HAPEN will employ an owner-driven approach in the construction of emergency shelters by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process.\n\nProtection and GBV concerns will be factored during site selection and will be integrated in all aspects of the response. Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.\n\nOn monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. \n\nThe PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. \n\n3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM. COVID-19 preventative mechanisms will be adopted in CRFM and during distribution to minimize any occurrence of infections.\n\nThe desks will be manned by two personnel and the anticipated data to be collected include among others both compliments and complaints: the quality of the ESKs and NFIs, beneficiary selection processes, shortness of items distributed, delays and other unexpected feedback.

Within March 2020, joint forces SNA/AMISOM took over Janale village as a strategic business center it is about 13KM to Marka district. As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. \nThus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need \u2013 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.\nAlthough markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. \nDuring the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it's quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.\nThe main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)). The project will ensure full coordination among humanitarian service provides especially shelter cluster partners who are working in the project areas in order to avoid duplications.",

        "description": "IDP communities in Bardera face cyclical scarcity to safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Bardera. During the most recent floods in October 2019, 90 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Bardera IDP communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. \n\nACTED will respond to this compounded risk by implementing a market-based project in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Bardera, including Bulo Ceesan, Bulo Garass, Liban, Xabalcadey, Horseed and Kulmiya IDP sites, and will serve 2634 households (15804 individuals). To ensure the sustainability of this action, ACTED will collaborate with the private sector to extend existing water networks to these communities and where necessary construct new water assets. Moreover, ACTED will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable IDP communities, whilst establishing relationships with the private sector for continued maintenance and operation of these assets.",

The project is framed around four sector areas, Shelter, WASH, Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) and Protection. NRC will intervene in the WASH sector, DRC in Protection sector while AVORD in Shelter and CCCM sectors to complement each other's activities. The project will be targeting the same locations and beneficiaries in various settlements in Xudur district.\n\n A pre-teaming agreement has been uploaded/attached to this proposal (see attached Annex-1) providing further details on the approach and rationale of the collaboration. In essence, the multi-cluster, multi-sector and multi-agency approach, will maximize assistance as different sectors and actors will be able to share critical information and inform immediate programming and re-design of programs. This approach will be useful to create synergies of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact. The interventions will support the targeted communities holistically and efficiently by providing well-tailored and packaged responses to address different needs of the people of concern. The integrated response is in line with SHF principles by prioritization direct implementation and supporting the integration of response across clusters. \n\n10 settlements will be targeted by all agencies (the name of these settlements are mentioned in attached Annex-3) and will reach 17,131 individuals (50% females) through WASH interventions that includes rehabilitation of existing productive shallow wells and installing them with complete Solar pumping system, construction of water storage facilities and distribution points. The project will improve sanitation and hygiene conditions of the target communities through construction of 450 family shared latrines with handwashing facilities, training of community based hygiene promoters to undertake awareness creation along with distribution of 1350 hygiene kits to displacement affected families. DRC will provide Protection assistance whereby AVORD will provide Shelter and CCCM assistance to the same beneficiaries. After the approval of the project, NRC and DRC will do joint needs assessment both in the district to select the most vulnerable settlements for interventions. Through this project, NRC will reach 17,131 individuals. Post Distribution, Monitoring (PDM) and post construction exercises will be carried out after 6 weeks of wash NFIs and construction of latrines to analyse the impact of the project.",

        "description": "In Lower Juba region and across Somalia, there are multiple threats to the health and resilience of the population due to inadequate WASH facilities. For water supply, Afmadow population is dependent on a mix of unprotected surface water sources and protected groundwater sources. Surface water sources are seasonal and usually contaminated, while protected groundwater supplies are either difficult to access to due to distance and/or not affordable due the high costs of extraction and the dominance of private sector entrepreneurs in their operation, often resulting in rates that the lower income communities cannot afford to access a minimum quantity of water per person per day (Sphere).\nIn this context, ARC will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1) Rehabilitation and/or extension of 5 existing water infrastructures to provide reliable and sustained access to safe water based on identified strategic community water points to flood affected communities in Afmadow district. (2) Establishment of 5 gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women participation in WASH projects. (3) Installation of new and/or rehabilitation of 600 sanitation facilities that are lockable from inside, gender segregated, with hand washing facilities, disaster sensitive with appropriate disaster mitigation features designs. As part of ensuring protection mainstreaming, ARC will install solar light near communal sanitation facilities or if this is not feasible will provide with individual household\u2019s solar lamp/torch. (4) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution to enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness and enable good practices. Significant amount of the above proposed WASH activities will be implemented through Market Based Programming (MBP) approach as to strengthen local markets. \n The proposed WASH project will complement set of emergency Health, Protection and livelihood interventions currently ongoing in the targeted areas of Afmadow district through other funding to ensure a comprehensive approach to reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with diseases and hazards resulting from deficient sanitation conditions, the lack of access to safe water and low level of good hygiene practices. ARC\u2019s WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. Approximately 24,000 people (4,000 households) will benefit from this intervention. All ARC WASH programs are community led, and leverage stakeholder cooperation to ensure safe, equitable, and dignified access to WASH services for all. Under Health sector, ARC is supporting one MCH (Bosnia) in Dhobley and would start Outreach health services in Afmadow town targeting IDP sites with vulnerable individuals having difficult access to basic lifesaving health services. ARC would also provide un-conditional cash transfer to vulnerable groups in Dhobley for 3 months aiming to improve food security situation as well as the nutrition indicators. ARC\u2019s integrated approach combining the WASH intervention with health and nutrition components ensures greater impact in the area of operation. Adequate WASH improves the overall public health indicators, including the lower incidence of communicable diseases, reduced mother and child morbidity and stronger effects of nutrition interventions as a result of prevention of loss of valuable nutrients from diarrheal diseases.",

PAH, NoFYL and HINNA will implement a multi cluster intervention aiming at 1) CCCM: improving the coordination and information management at site level 2) WASH: addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs in this field 3) PROTECTION: mainstreaming protection through (a) preventing and response to eviction, including monitoring threats of evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant cluster to mobilize support for advocacy (b) To advocacy and campaigns that aim to ensure lawful eviction processes (c) Capacity development of settlement managers, local authorities in the field of housing, land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). 4) SHELTER: improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and construction of Transitional shelters.\nActivities will be implemented by PAH, NoFYL and HINNA in 2 districts (Kaxda and Deynile) of Banadir region. Activities will target the most undeserved areas of these districts that host mostly newly displaced IDPs due to drought and conflicts. Approximately 17,400 people (3,283 men, 6505 Boys, 9,710 girls and 4,886 women) including 3658 people with disability will directly benefit from this intervention. It will also benefit an entire community working in targeted IDP sites, including local authorities, clusters and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach and synergies enable the partners to concentrate services and expertise within the same location and same population, leading to a greater impact.\n\nMoreover, PAH acts as WASH Cluster co-lead at national cluster level, NoFYL is part of SRCs and member of CCCM and protection cluster, while HINNA is a member of shelter cluster in Banadir region. This allows to ensure a great capacity for project implementation and a strong understanding of the cluster strategy. Each partner will directly implement activities of their specialization sector. The coordination among partners will be done throughout an entire implementation process to ensure synergies and combine services delivery for all sectors. The partners will jointly conduct periodic monitoring activities to assess implementation of the project, collect feedback from beneficiaries and adjust implementation accordingly if needed. This will be done through harmonized tools that will be developed during the project kick-off meeting. Furthermore, NoFYL, while  providing protection services to IDPs, will also ensure that protection is mainstreamed throughout WASH activities conducted by PAH  as well as Shelter activities conducted by HINNA,  by providing relevant training and ensuring strong coordination.",

        "description": "Apart from the other layers of hazards existing in the target areas, COVID-19 had also impacted small scale farmers. It has been reported many farmers have abandoned their farming and sought an alternative source of income from the nearby towns. This has increased and exposed the farmers to the risk of COVID 19. \nA.\tFood security of poor farmers through revitalizing agricultural production in the targeted areas. Through cash for work, irrigation canal will be rehabilitated, and farm inputs will be supplied.  The rehabilitation work will be on excavating (desilting) of flood damaged canals.  This will improve the accessibility and availability of water for irrigation uses. Two canals with dimension of 2m width and 1m depth and 2km length will be rehabilitated. Each canal will provide water to 10 farms. In addition to this, the farmers will receive an improved seed such as maize, sesame, tomatoes and pumpkins.  Availing water and seeds to farmers will improve their farm activities and reduce the risk of seeking labour to unsafe environments. In doing this the farmers will start producing by themselves and subsequently able to both feed their families and sell their produce. The project will link to farmers to the existing potential markets through establishing a network between agriculture traders and target farmer groups.  This activity will be done for 15 days by 200 farmers at a rate of $5 per day. Each farm will be distributed with farm equipment\u2019s worth $200\n\nB.\tIncreased employment opportunity through VSLA and income generating activities:  As COVID 19 had mostly impacted poor and vulnerable people who were dependent on market activities such as labour, aid and family support. In the first phase, the project had transferred cash to maintain the minimum food basket for target households.  The cash had supported families to sustain their livelihoods in specific periods of the project. In order to move to an early socio-economic recovery, on the second phase, the project intends to transition from short term cash transfer to more sustainable income generating activities.  The project will introduce a village, saving and loans association approach (VSLA) to improve access to financial resources for poor households, targeting women in priority. The primary purpose of a VSLA is to provide simple savings and loan facilities and through these and other enabling activities empower women to manage resources and invest them for the benefit of their household. Loans can provide a form of self- insurance to members, supplemented by a saving fund which provides small but important income to members in distress. The VSLA system enables members of a self-selected group to voluntarily save money through purchasing shares. The savings are then invested in a loan fund from which members can borrow as well as meet their immediate needs such as food, water and health care or make further investments to diversify and increase their incomes. The project will support 15 VSLA groups of 15 \u2013 20 members with initial seed fund of 3000 USD for each group. The activity will start with community mobilization, selection of households to participate and group formation. While the methodology is simple, it depends on a very carefully structured system of training. Over seven sessions, groups learn to: form their associations; define a purpose; elect officials; design their system of savings, insurance and credit; and practice running savings and credit meetings. Once this process is completed, VSLAs can begin to save and to lend. They are supervised over a period of 12 months by field staffs who ensure procedures and systems work properly and that the groups can function independently thereafter;\n\nC.\tHealth: Strengthened capacity of existing health facilities and services to combat Covid-19. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to 3 health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections. Other activities also include procurement of medicines, community mobilization outreach and training of frontline health workers. IR will also work with the government hospitals and other unit of covid-19 task force in the preparation of covid roll-out. IR will support through advocacy and media outreach for people to accept and take the vaccines. This approach of advocacy, lobbying through media and electronic information sharing will enable the roll-out of vaccines. IR will also use its health facilities as centre for passing information to patients and their dependents to take up vaccines once its made available. Similarly, IR will by making available a vehicle and a driver support the ministry of health with logistics mainly in Balaad, Baidoa and Bandar districts.\n\nD.\tWASH: The project will expand water points in IDPs. In some IPDs for instance Dayniile district, the accessibility of water stands for handwashing is still very small. The water point will allow beneficiaries to easily access water points for handwashing in their proximity.  The expansion will include laying out of pipes and construction of fenced water points. The expansion will improve the sanitation and hygiene of IDP communities so that they can prevent from themselves the spread of COVID 19 pandemic. The water points will be placed in strategic position such as schools and health centres. Additionally, IR will construct water tanks, piping system, training of water committee with a view to make water available for covid-19 prevention. \n\nE.\tProtection: Since there is a prevailing reports of incidence of gender based violence, early marriage, the project will carry out an awareness sessions including training of women and men. These sessions will be in line with Islamic Relief Somalia safeguarding and protection principles.",

        "description": "The key objective is to implement preventative measures for vulnerable groups that have limited access to COVID-19 prevention and response actions. This is to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in urban IDP settings. The intervention will focus on the most vulnerable groups: older people \u2013 forming approximately 2.7 per cent of the population and the urban poor and IDPs about 75% of the population. Assessments shows these as most vulnerable who are heavily impacted by COVID-19 infection. For this response, IRS seeks to complement the efforts of the government and other humanitarian organisation in Somalia by reaching approximately 40,000 beneficiaries directly and up to 200,000 indirectly.\n1. Risk communication and community engagement. The proposed project will support preventative measures to combat the spread of COVID 19. This will include extensive awareness initiatives using multiple media channels to support preventative action of the government and communities. The information/ education and communication is designed to reach the population  through print, audio-visual media messages, SMS and community mobilisation using religious/community/group leaders and elders. Display monitors on COVID 19 risks and prevention in local language will be installed at strategic locations such as roundabouts, airports and community centres in IDP camps.\n2.  Health: Strengthen existing health facilities in the selected IDP camps to combat COVID 19 infection. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to seven health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will also set up and equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections.\n3. WASH: Reduce the spread of COVID 19 and decrease morbidity and mortality in the selected districts. The project improve hygiene practices, limiting infection IDP camps.24 hand-washing stations will be built in the IDP camps in Bondhere, Baidoa, Balcad, Gardho and Burtinle. Hygiene kits, containing bath soap, laundry soap, 2 jerry cans, and facemask, will be supplied to 3500 households. Special consideration will be given to female headed household and PWD. \n4. Livelihood: Improving livelihoods through unconditional cash transfer of USD 70 for 3 months to 333 households, and USD 70 cash assistance for 2 months to 333 households as livelihoods support. The beneficiaries will be selected using robust selection criteria that targets the most vulnerable and prioritise female headed household. The UCT will be done using mobile money transfer which has the benefit of increased security, convenience, privacy, speed, reduced operational/transaction costs and logistics for the beneficiaries and for Islamic relief. Somalia has large mobile network reach. The choice of money gives the beneficiaries the widest range of transactional capabilities and broad access to basic financial services (such as deposit, withdrawal, person-to-person transfers and e-money transactions with registered traders of goods and service providers). Islamic Relief used mobile money in drought/ flood emergency programme (including WFP Baxnaano programme). The lessons from previous experience which guide the choice of UCT include: \n-  Beneficiaries purchase a more diverse set of goods, had higher dietary diversity,\n- Beneficiaries depleted fewer assets and grew more types of crops, especially marginal cash crops grown by women.  They are able to o restock livelihood assets faster. The reasons for this can be attributed to the lower costs and greater privacy of receiving a cash transfer via the mobile transfer, as well as changes in intra-household decision-making.\n5. Establish complaint management and feedback mechanism to the affected population. Through this intervention, IR MEAL unit will ensure that project delivers responses as designed to the affected population. Through an established mechanism of complaints mechanism and feedback channels, the affected population will be made to understand and demand their rights until all is provided to their satisfaction. \n6. Build and establish DRR community champions for covid-19 preparedness, response and treatment. The established committee is trained on covid-19 risk reduction management. Their role is to ensure that community members are made aware of the impact of covid-19, where to seek treatment and how to enforce containment measures such as social distancing and use of mask and sanitisers as part of exposure reduction. \nIRS will lead the implementation. The project will build on existing IRS interventions in health WASH and livelihood sectors and maximise the impact and sustainability",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Somalia is deteriorating due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflict About 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, an increase from the 5.2 million reported in 2020. Up to 2.7 million people are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse and will face acute food insecurity through mid-2021. An estimated 840,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, 143,000 of them severely and at risk of death. According to Somalia HNO for 2021 the protracted crisis in Somalia, compounded by COVID-19, floods and droughts, has resulted in massive challenges in meeting the WASH needs of the Somali population. According to the JMCNA, approximately 8.9 million people are affected by poor WASH conditions. For 2021, it is estimated that 4.6 million people are in catastrophic (10 per cent), severe (9 per cent) or extreme (18 per cent) need of humanitarian WASH assistance. The 10 per cent of households in catastrophic need mainly face a lack of access to water both in terms of quality and quantity, accompanied by a lack of access to functional sanitation. It is also a cause of relapse for acute diarrheal diseases when treated patients and children return to their communities with limited safe water and sanitation coverage, resulting in limited sustainability of health programs.\nAccording to assessment conducted by BTSC in Nov,2020 findings revealed that majority of the households (63.3%) use unsafe water from a water catchment or a dam as their primary source for drinking water and the said dam has dried up and the cost of 200 litters of water is currently costing between $3-$4 US Dollars which is not affordable to the drought affected communities. Additionally, 43.5% of sampled households do not treat drinking water. The assessment also revealed that only 45% of the resident do have access to latrines and 98% of those latrines are not accessible to people with disabilities. only 37.5% of the assessed families reported to have access to soap.\nIn the context mentioned above GRRN will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1)Improve access to safe water through water trucking to 10,000 drought affected population in priority sites /settlements/ communities targeting in Bay(Burhakaba). Rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures one borehole and 6 shallow wells with hand pump. (2) Construction of water infrastructures including construction of tanks and distribution networks, hybrid solar water pumping system in Burhakaba Borehole (Site selection should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions). (3)Establishment of gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity` of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects.(4) construction of 60 latrines in settlements (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) hosting new displaced population. (5) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and 1,500 hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes) accompanied by robust hygiene promotion activities. GRRN WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings, WASH Chapter as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. The total beneficiaries targeted in this project are 14,000(6,720 women, 4,480 men, 1,680 girls and 1,120 boys) in Burhakaba.",

        "description": "The impact of the ongoing drought compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict and forecast of below-average Deyr rainfall from April to June 2021 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood followed by drought in the Jalalaqsi district to 15,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved and/or hard to reach communities from 5 villages under Jalalaqsi namely Doondheere, Raafey, Habar robe, Cadiley, Sheeloow, Dirggoys east, Buulo Barwaaqo, Baqdaad east and Jalalaqsi town. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project are the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) for a period of 45 days. (Site of the distribution selection by the women/girls should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions).\n\n- Construction of 5 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps in 5 villages in Jalalaqsi district, (Baqdad east, Dirgoys east, Raafey, Dondheere, and Bulo Barwaaqo) with special consideration on disabled and child-friendly accessibility.\n- Upgrade one borehole in Jalalaqsi town (Amaana Borehole) Howlwadaag section of Jalalaqsi town, equipped with the hybrid system including rehabilitation of existing water tank, construction of water kiosk for human use, Construction of engine room, and piping network.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 6 WASH committees and 12 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting.\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. nevertheless, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion compounded with covid-19 awareness campaigns to reach 15,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health, and feeding centers. \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out. \n-Distribute 500 HP kits to 500 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 58 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods to the most affected community including 5 latrines especially constructed for disabled people.\nTo  strengthen the local markets-Based Programming (MBP) approach AADSOM will ensure that:\n- The service providers should be selected locally if available.\n- The contracted service providers should purchase the required material and equipment in the local market if available.\n- The contracted service provider should hire skilled and skilled workers from the local people.",

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s prolonged humanitarian crisis is characterized by ongoing conflicts, climate-related shocks, communicable disease outbreaks, and weak social protection mechanisms. Since the beginning of 2020, three additional shocks have contributed to a deterioration of humanitarian conditions: Extensive floods, Desert Locust infestations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These compounding shocks have exacerbated humanitarian needs among a population already living under the strain of widespread poverty and decades of armed conflict and insecurity. Climate change continues to be a major contributing factor to displacement and food insecurity in Somalia.\nIncreasingly erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions and floods, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Flooding displaced 919,000 people in 2020 and destroyed essential infrastructure, property, and 144,000 hectares of agricultural land. a serious lack of access to clean water and sanitation is heightening the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases exacerbating existing fragilities, especially where health services are too few and/or too distant. In this project, ARD is aimed to improve access to WASH services for Ceelberde IDPs, host communities with recognition of people of disabilities, and the most vulnerable population through the provision of safe water drinking with water vouchers for 60 days period,. Construction/rehabilitation of 22 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps, benefiting around 11,000 (2500 men, 5700 women, 1400 girls, and 1400 boys) crisis-affected IDPs and host communities will be under taken. ARD will also construct 50 flood-resistant latrines to benefit residents in the Ceelberde IDP sites which will also receive the clean water and hygiene promotions and hygiene kits. Approximately, 10% of the 50 latrines (corresponding to 5) will be preserved for people with disabilities living in the target locations. A total of 2500 (500 men, 1500 women, 250 girls, and 250 boys) people will benefit from access to the sanitation, 1000 Households will benefit from hygiene kit distribution and hygiene awareness, Chlorination of wells and WASH committees will be established in addition, carry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Ceelberde district,",

        "description": "A locust invasion in Somalia is threatening livelihoods as crops and vegetation for livestock foraging suffer extensive damage. According to the Somaliland National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) localized damage has been observed in Somaliland, where locusts have occupied a total of 100,000ha of Somaliland\u2019s coastal region including Woqooyi Galbeed. This has affected1,087,264 people, of which 22,853 are in IDPs camps. SC has observed the impact of the locust invasion to be most severe in Hargeisa Maroodijeh with 8,000ha of rangeland and 3,000ha of crop land damaged. In addition, Agabar and Arbasiyo villages in Gabiley districts have also been hard-hit with 1,000ha of damaged land. The Woqooyi Galbeed region was already characterized by significant food security gaps which is exacerbated by the desert locust crisis. According to the FSNAU technical release 153,000 people are food insecure (IPC 3 or 4) including 12,054 in Gabiley district and 139,134 in Hargeisa district. An SC survey showed that pastoralists are skipping meals or selling their remaining livestock for low prices to purchase food. There is also an increasing trend of labor migration at the critical time of Gu seasonal preparation. Only few actors respond to the locust crisis in this area including SOS and World Vision. Response gaps affirmed by the Food Security Cluster (FSC) monthly dashboard show 150,000 people need urgent Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to protect access to food security. These include IDPs and pastoralists who have lost their livestock and have less than 6 goats. In addition to the locust crisis, Somalia is also at risk of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Somalia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 16th March 2020 and currently has 60 recorded cases including 5 in Somaliland and 2 in Woqooyi Galbeed. Given the rapid pace of the virus and lack of access to testing kits, there are concerns that the number of cases will rise rapidly.",

Guided by a Steering Committee, the Partnership is comprised of developed and developing nations and international institutions and led by Co-Chairs from the Republic of Costa Rica and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. A Support Unit, which facilitates the work of the Partnership, has grown and consolidated to support its ambitious vision. As more governments seek support for turning NDCs into action, membership continues to grow considerably.",

        "description": "In 2020, Somalia had been hit by Multiple threats from Covid-19, locusts, conflict, insecurity, forced evictions, droughts, and flooding. The number of people in need has consistently increased over the last three years, from 4.2 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020 and 5.9 million in 2021 according to the CCCM cluster Acaps review. This is further reflected in the number of displaced people in 2020/2021. 47% of the population of 12.3 million needs some form of humanitarian assistance, including 2.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), with an additional half a million displaced on average per year as a result of climatic conditions and conflict. Most displacement-affected persons face multiple or recurrent displacements, with a majority of IDPs having been displaced at least five times previously and very few return to areas of origin. Post-Gu IPC analysis conducted in September 2020 by FEWSNET and partners, indicates that an estimated 1.7 million people are anticipated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with 0.4 million persons experiencing an emergency (IPC Phase 4). An additional 3.0 million persons are expected to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2), with the current conditions projected to remain unchanged by end of 2020. Projections running into 2021, through May, predict continued Stressed (IPC 2) and Crisis (IPC 3) outcomes to persevere, largely due to continued struggles of affected households to overcome shocks. Households in IDP areas in the Banadir region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by the high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large-scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. Camp coordination and camp management is a relatively a concept that\u2019s limited within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized to this concept. \n\nSCC will implement these activities in 20 IDP sites in Kahda district of Banadir region with over 30,000HHs as per the latest detailed site assessment (DSA), targeting a largely underserved area. Approximately 36000 IDPs (6000 households) will benefit from this proposed intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding, or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys, and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age, and diversity dis-segregated data. SCC will implement this intervention in the Kahda district of Banadir region targeting 6000 HHs. Kaxda District is one of the IDP major hubs in Mogadishu that hosts the largest number of IDPs. Throughout the project, the needs of women, girls, men, and boys of all ages will be addressed throughout the planning, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation of the activities. Through regular site monitoring, needs and gaps will be reported and shared with partners and all stakeholders. Particular attention regarding needs will be paid to women and girls who also have to contend with GBV and protection concerns within camp settings. Through this project, SCC will also address the current and newly identified needs by setting up camp coordination structures at the national and, where necessary, regional or district levels, facilitating and supporting the establishment of effective coordination and management in IDP sites while respecting national context and authorities.",

        "description": "This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 36,000 IDP persons from 40 settlements in Kahda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including enhancing the capacity of camp governance structures and site-level committees to promote information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include organizing site-level coordination meetings among service providers and local authorities to highlight priority needs and challenges, mitigate protection risks and ensure efficient use of existing referral pathways. 10 site-level mobilizers, each serving as a focal point for 4 sites, will be hired from target IDPs to circulate key messages, report on gaps, conduct service mapping, needs and new arrivals, conduct site monitoring and take shelter-level CFM complaints in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address vulnerabilities and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nSite maintenance committees and IDPs in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out. In the selection of cash-for-work beneficiaries, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complaint mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population. Target sites will be prioritized based on vulnerability such as congestion levels, proportion of minority groups, potential exposure to protection risks and overall living conditions. AVORD will utilize cluster tools such as the IDP site risk map or DSA data in the process of site selection. A site-level Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be developed and the project team will ensure that the system is accessible for all populations and that the mechanism is clearly understood and supported by the community.\n\nThe present proposal will complement an interagency program currently being implemented by AVORD and other partners in Banadir to provide WASH and awareness raising services to reduce Covid 19 transmission. Synergies will be developed with these activities to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the resources.",

This is through improving access to quality education, increase access to critical WASH inputs and enhance child protection mechanisms in 15 schools that are among the priority schools for the education cluster that are at a high risk to close or have closed due to drought in Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. These schools are: Almaamum and Balihoowd primary in Balanbale Cumar Khadaab and Lajide primary in Xeraale Tawakal, Dugsiga H/dhexe and Howlwadhaag primary schools in Abudwak Xananleey, Alma\u2019mun, and Higlaale primary in Dhusamareeb Mucalim Ibrahim and Kobciye IDP primary in Guriceel and Kulmiye IDP, Docoley and Dayax primary in Cadaado. The identified needs in the 15 schools include water shortage, poor state of classroom and WASH facilities, shortage of teaching and learning materials, limited access to dry food rations, low attendance rate of teachers due to lack of incentives, low awareness on child protection reporting mechanisms by students and teachers, poor hygiene in the schools due limited access to clean water for drinking and handwashing. These needs have affected attendance and retention of learners in the 15 targeted schools. The main gaps in delivery of quality education services in the 15 schools include limited capacity of the Ministry of Education to provide the required education services due to budgetary constraints lack of intervention by other education partners due to the remoteness of the school that contributes to inaccessibility and security challenges to operate in these areas recurrent drought and intermittent conflict leading to loss of livelihoods for the communities in the targeted locations. The project will target to directly reach 2,315 learners out of which 1,266 boys and 1,049 are girls, 30 teachers translating to 2 teachers plus 1 head teacher per school, 30 community hygiene promoters and indirectly reach 45 CEC members. Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, water trucking to the schools to ensure a regular supply of water to the schools during drought, construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with community hygiene promoters (CHPs). To ensure inclusion of students with disabilities, child, gender and disability friendly latrines will be constructed with accessibility ramps and door sizes made within the required inclusion standards to enable access by students with disabilities to these facilities. CISP will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by drought and displacement. To ensure centrality of protection in the schools, CISP will assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, appoint and train protection focal points in the schools to strengthen feedback and reporting mechanisms to address protection concerns in the schools., Through engagement with ministry officials such as Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education  MoECHE Gender Focal Points,  the Ministry of Women and Human rights Development MoWHRD Regional Child Protection Coordinator and CECs, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

Further, the intervention proposes to support learner retention, improve learning environment and ensure safety of learners. The intervention has been designed to meet the needs of vulnerable girls, women, boys and men, IDPs and host communities in the three target districts (Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow). In ensuring centrality of protection, the program has been designed to enhance awareness/dissemination of child protection amp safeguarding principles with targeted girls and boys through establishment of leadership networks/clubs/platforms in targeted public schools in Gedo region. The intervention has based a big bulk of its outputs towards supporting IDP children (70%) and children from vulnerable host communities to enroll in permanent functional schools within Gedo, to ensure sustainability. The intervention is designed to build on gains made by the ongoing Education Cannot Wait (ECW) project as well as DFID funded Leave No Girl Behind (LNGB) which targets the same schools and locations, and to leverage and complement on other sectoral interventions in the same schools (WASH, Protection, Health), and will adopt an integrated approach that will focus on drought, protection, COVID-19 prevention and control, and life-saving interventions. In order to ensure access to safe and protective learning environment for vulnerable learners, the intervention shall among other key interventions: construct/rehabilitate TLS, provide safe drinking water hygiene promotion in schools (including COVID-19 prevention and control messaging), distribute sanitary kits to girls, establish school WASH facilities based on need, distribute TLM, pay emergency teacher incentives, provision of school feeding program as well as implementation of child protection activities in line with the education and child protection integrated response framework. The intervention will be implemented in a total of eighteen (18) schools in Gedo Region. The final list of schools will be agreed upon together with the Gedo Education Cluster Focal Point (HIRDA) to ensure that only the most needy drought-affected schools are supported. A draft list of the schools (including locations) to be supported is provided in the documents section.",

The targeted schools are either closed or at the brink of closure due to the impact of the deteriorating drought conditions in the target locations. The proposed intervention aims to provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance to drought-affected school children whereby the proposed project will be targeting to improve access to quality education and increase access to critical WASH inputs for the lifesaving of the affected school children in (10) Ten schools (three in xafuun and Seven in Bosaso )Hanaqad IDP Daryeel Primary School, Gargaar IDP Primary, Bilaal IDP Primary School, Bandarqasim IDP Primary School, often primary, Daryeel IDP Primary School, Yaasiin IDP Primary School, Foocaar Primary School Hadha Primary School, Barmadoobe Primary Schools are among the schools that are most affected by Drought and Cyclone Gati in Bosaso and Xaafun districts bari region of Puntland State of Somalia.\nThese Programme specific activities will include the provision of educational supplies and equipment including school furniture\u2019s for refurbished and constructed classrooms based on the minimum standards of education cluster School feeding program for Most vulnerable pupils to meet student\u2019s minimum caloric needs emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers rehabilitations of learning spaces that are affected by the cyclone, sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school and establishment of school WASH facilities, etc... \nSpecific WASH activities in schools will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision and installation of PVC water storage tanks, Water tracking for affected schools rehabilitation of latrines, and construction of Child- and gender-friendly latrines in the affected schools, Provision of Aqua tabs, where necessary, rehabilitated to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, a joint assessment along with Community Education Committees (CEC) will be conducted in schools to find a sustainable solution for water availability but currently, PMWDO will conduct a water trucking for 3 months for 3,300(1720 boys and 1580 girls) school children in IDP and affected schools.\nThe proposed project will be complemented with other ongoing PMWDO education interventions in the region, as well as other wider emergency responses. PMWDO is currently implementing a UNICEF-funded \u201cEducating girls with disabilities\u201d in the Puntland State of Somalia but not in the target location for this project. This proposed project will not only complement but also retain children in the affected target locations to have access to continued learning otherwise children would have displaced to where there is an ongoing intervention which could create a burden on the ongoing response. The proposed response is therefore meant to link up to reach to school being supported under this program to enable the children to continue access education support. The project will also extend to cover other schools where high EIE needs have been established but are not covered by PMWDO or any other organization. PMWDO will rehabilitate classrooms and other affected infrastructure like Latrines. The project also envisages addressing the immediate needs of the students through the distribution of scholastic materials/TLM including learning kits, curriculum books, and recreational materials. The project will guarantee gender mainstreaming, and equity as 1200 girls will be supported with dignity kits and sanitary pads. Using the reflective circles' approach PMWDO will train 32 teachers (18 males and 14 female) teachers and the students on Education in Emergency contents and life skills development.",

        "description": "The NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO\n\nIn response to, and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed of 4 INGOs: Halo Trust, IRC, INTERSOS, FCA and 1 LNGO SYDAVO), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training and preparation to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support. Information is shared on adhoc basis daily or several time a day as alerts if the security incident requires the immediate action of NGOs and scheduled products are sent every week, every fortnight and every quarter\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor assistants (all INSO staff have their own network to source information as they are very close to the community and in contact with a wide range of local actors), NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 57,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO Training Team runs training programs which targets both individual safety and management of the organization's security. Finally, INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs.\nThe project budget leans heavily in HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "Critical humanitarian needs persist in Somalia across the different livelihood groups whose vulnerabilities continue to worsen due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic and escalating conflict. The poor Deyr rains (October to December 2020) led to the inadequate pasture for livestock, water shortage and below average crop production. The deteriorating food security outlook combined with the worsening malnutrition appeals for a rapid, well-targeted and coordinated scale up of responses to save lives and recovery of livelihoods assets. The project aims to improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihood assets related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages through conditional cash transfers to enhance livelihood opportunities and rehabilitation of water infrastructures and provision of fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in agro-pastoral and pastoral villages in Belet-Hawa district, Gedo region. \nThe project will target 815 vulnerable drought affected agro-pastoral and pastoral households among women, men, boys, girls, including female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The detrimental effects of the current shocks have severely and directly affected rural communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk leading to household food insecurity, increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and livestock use. Additionally, the affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debts. \nCOOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation process, target communities, especially women, girls and the disabled will be included in community representative committees and decision making processes In selection of beneficiaries, registrations, verifications and monitoring exercises so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, conditional cash transfer will be provided to 815 affected household including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services.\nTo restore livelihood assets of households, 815 beneficiaries will engage in cash for work activities construction and/or rehabilitation of water catchments and water harvesting structures (soil bunds), 150 households among the CFW beneficiaries will also be provided with fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in the areas where soil bunds structures have been constructed to regenerate pasture to ensure availability of fodder for livestock. This activity aims at restoring livestock assets of the communities and envisages reducing workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, gender based violence and exploitation malpractices associated with in search of livestock feeds and water for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed activity. In summary the following activities will be carried out:\n1. Provide conditional cash transfer to 815 households in Belet-Hawa district to increase household purchasing power and rehabilitate livelihood assets and water sources.\n2. Support to fodder production through provision of Sudan grass seeds) for 150 affected households in Belet-Hawa district.",

The project will aim at providing an immediate lifesaving intervention to drought affected population in Abudwak and Taleex district of Galgadud and Sool regions of Somalia, where food security situation is very critical. HOD will provide immediate lifesaving to drought affected population targeting 700 households (4,200) persons, (500 men, 934 women, 1332 boys, 1434 girls) in Galgaduud and Sool region through conditional cash transfer for three consecutive months and distribution of Sudanese grass seeds as an alternative livestock feed to be planted and grown by 400 household who also beneficiaries of CFW activities in Abudwak district. The project will ensure inclusion of disability by targeting 114 people living with disability including (12 men, 62 women, 19 boys and 21 girls). The intervention will result improved food availability and accessibility among the most vulnerable households in IPC 3 and 4 in Abudwak and Taleex district of Somalia in the short term and in the medium and the long term will result reduced negative coping mechanism of the targeted beneficiaries. The intervention will employ community based targeting where local community leadership will have more role and say on who will be targeted and benefit from the project. The 700 households (4,200) will benefit from rehabilitated water catchments which is a productive livelihood asset for the rural community as it enhances access to water for their livestock. They will also benefit from distribution of   Sudanese grass seeds which is drought resistant grass which  will be grown by same CFW beneficiaries in Abudwak to be used as alternative livestock feed during the dry period. Women dependent households will be given priority and other marginalized segments of the target communities. Protocols of observing the community culture, privacy and dignity will be observed   in close collaboration with the local community leadership and other stakeholders.

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is to directly improve immediate access to food for at least 279 households (1,953 individuals considering a household size of 7 individuals) including 239 households benefiting from conditional cash transfers and 40 households benefiting from fodder production and management training and seeds support. \n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers to provide conditional cash transfers for improved access to food, rehabilitate water infrastructure and other communal livelihood assets such as rangelands, reseeding of the rehabilitated rangelands and construction of fodder shades. The project will also train selected beneficiaries in improved fodder production and management. The project directly targets mostly under-served individuals and living in hard to reach areas in 5 villages including Badhi Galis Satellite, Bixin, Masle in Ceel Afweyn district and Rag Caddeye, Marwade in Ceerigaabo district all in Sanag region. The target beneficiaries will mainly include women, men, persons with disability, children and the elderly and other vulnerable groups broadly categorized as host communities and IDPs. The project duration is 7 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions. \n\nSpecifically, 239 households (HH) including 235 workers and 4 foremen will receive conditional Cash Transfers. Each of the 235 household/ beneficiary will receive $126 for 3 months/ rounds, while the 4 foremen will be recruited for 54 days and paid a daily rate of $10. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. A PDM will be conducted after the first round of cash transfer to determine level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries. A local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFurthermore, at least 40 households from Bali Gelis and Bixin will be trained in improved fodder production and management and provided with fodder seedlings. In the same villages, 2 fodder shades will be constructed to improve fodder storage. \n\nAlso, 2 berkads will be constructed in 2 villages including Rag Caddeye and Marwade in Ceerigaabo district and 2 dams will be rehabilitated in Rag Caddeye and Masle villages through conditional cash transfer in order to improve community access to water for household and livestock use through rehabilitated water infrastructure. Water catchments (rangelands) will be rehabilitated and reseeded to increase availability of fodder for the animals. \n\nCandlelight has rolled out a mobile phone/ technology beneficiary feedback and complaints mechanism (\u201cfeedback loops\u201d) with a tool free and easy to remember telephone number. This will enable beneficiaries to provide feedback and complaints but as well receive feedback from Candlelight.",

The intervention aims to ensure that lives are saved and human suffering is reduced through provision of food security production inputs to targeted beneficiaries in order to ensure immediate access to inputs and subsequently to food for the most vulnerable populations. Due to the Current biting  droughts , this project  will target a total of 650 HHs approximately 3,900(585 men, 975women, 1,170 boys and 1,170 girls in drought affected people in Garowe. Female-headed HHs and young adolescents girls will constitute approximately 60% of beneficiary households. This weighting towards female-headed households is because they are considered more vulnerable due to their restricted options for paid labor. Once a household has been identified as a beneficiary, the project will primarily target women and who have lost livelihoods as result of water shortages within the households to receive  cash for work vouchers by rehabilitating harvesting structures and Berked  as result of the water shortage, Women have been targeted as beneficiaries since they typically make household food purchases and determine meal distribution within the household. Furthermore, The proposed project will target those households in the most critical situations. Not all households are at the same level of destitution or crisis. There are, for example, some households that do not have productive assets but receive remittances from relatives abroad. Beneficiary identification and selection will be managed by KAALO and facilitated by the existing  villages and elder Committees (CRCs), which are comprised of IDPs leaders, community elders and key stakeholders\nCriteria for targeting is as follows: priority will be given to recently displaced (within the past year) female headed HHs, HHs with vulnerable members including pregnant women, children lt5, elderly, sick and/or disabled persons. Individual households (both IDP and local community) will be targeted and selected based on established criteria for vulnerability as mentioned above. \n\n1.\tRehabilitation of two water catchment to immediately access to cash for work to 300 HHs for 2 months , These will be constructed during selected months to enable over 1800 beneficiaries (300HHs) including men, women, boys and girls (gt18 years of age) get Cash for work to cover food. KAALO will distribute 100 sets of hand tools per village for two locations. Each set is composed (4 shovels,3 hoes, 12 empty bags, 3 pickaxes, and 6 wheelbarrows).These activities are targeted equally for men and women and include rehabilitation of water catchments.\n2.Provision of fodder inputs to 300 Vulnerable farmers (benefitting 1800 vulnerable persons) through which each HHS will get 7 kg of of fodder seeds to enable access to food. In line with FSC guidance, each household will receive 7kgs which includes: Soudan Grass (7kg). \n3. Construction of fodder storage canters that be used by the Agro-pastoralists to enhance production through cash for work to enable them provide storage for the fodder. activities will be implemented will have a participation of at least 50% women including at project committee level through cash for work to enable them provide storage for the fodder. \n4.Rehabilitation of 1 berkeds under Garowe district through community engagement and cash for work to improve access too food to drought affected communities. \nIn order to keep the sustainability of the project target outputs and increase the production of the beneficiaries,  KAALO will train selected farmers from the target farmers on the best technologies  and methodologies to increase their livelihood.",

The project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 662 unskilled labourers and 44 semi-skilled labourers rehabilitating 9 Water Pans in 9 settlements in Galkayo South. Each of the 662 unskilled labourers shall get $6 per day while each of the 44 semi-skilled labourers will work at the rate of $8 per day:- Daily work output per person per day as per the Somalia CWG standards is 1.585M3 ( 5hours* 0.317M3). The total number of working days is 25 for each water pan, However, they will be rehabilitated in different months to allow for prudent supervision, monitoring and evaluation and reporting by the project team. The nine water pans to be rehabilitated are 1. Gaarcad, 2. Dhagfaruuryaale, 3. Cinjirre, 4. Laamawayne, 5. Rasan, 6. Balicadde, 7. Xaarxaar, 8. Qooraseyn, 9.Biyogaduud.\n\nThe project will specifically prioritise destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the four Districts). The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains and Desert locust infestation leading to inadequate pasture, water resources and below-average crop production in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below-average rainfall for the coming Gu 2021 season as indicated by FEWSNET/FSNAU in its February to September 2021 update. \n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries, ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project activities to ensure it provides women the safety and protection required. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. \n\nCPD plans to use the first 2 months of the project to undertake household vulnerability assessment in the identified locations within South Mudug, undertake community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration for the Conditional Cash Transfers beneficiaries captured in KoboConnect. The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). The rehabilitation works involving excavation of water pans to required provided dimensions will be done across 3 months for the 9 sites in Galkayo South of Mudug region. Payments to the unskilled and semi-skilled labourers will be made through Mobile Money Transfer once the scheduled work is completed.

        "description": "Mercy-USA\u2019s strategic interventions will ensure increased access to nutrition services and expanded coverage through 4 fixed facilities, 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team), and community levels. This three-pronged approach is part of Mercy-USA\u2019s strategy to respond to populations' immediate and medium-term needs under distress by supporting the local health facilities and the Ministry of Health capacity to implement nutrition interventions in line with nutrition guidelines available. Specifically, this nutrition program will promote access to quality care, adequate nutrition, and encourage healthier behaviors to optimize the communities\u2019 resilience to future nutrition emergencies. \nMercy-USA for Aid and Development, in partnership with the MoH, will continue to address the nutrition challenges by implementing the integrated package in 2 fixed facilities in Karan district and 2 fixed facilities and 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team) in Yaqshid district in Banadir region.\nFacility and community-based Basic Nutrition Services Package (BNSP) will cover both curative and preventative interventions targeting children under 5 years old (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women.\nMercy-USA will ensure that the nutrition sites will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff, and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. \nMercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and offer refresher trainings to staff.\nThis program will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support, and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. \nScreening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programs. \nAccording to IMAM guidelines, children in the nutrition program will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition program will receive deworming drugs and relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A.\nSerious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia. Mercy-USA will thus support the provision of routine EPI activities. This will continue to increase immunization coverage among women and children lt5 years. IDPs, nomadic groups and remote or difficult to access communities are most at risk of missing out on routine EPI. Therefore, Mercy-USA will facilitate outreach nutrition and EPI teams to serve the people who are far from the facilities.\nAdditionally, Mercy-USA will screen everyone entering a healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and ensure all the preventive and control measures. Although screening for symptoms will not identify asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals with COVID 19 infection, symptom screening remains an important strategy to identify those who could have COVID-19 so appropriate precautions can be implemented.",

The proposed project aims to increase coverage and access to the management of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition (MAM/SAM), vitamin A supplementation and deworming as well as promotion of optimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. SOS will adopt an expansive IYCF in Emergencies (IYCF-E) strategy aimed at increasing reach beyond mothers raising infants but also fathers, grandfathers, community leaders, religious leaders, teachers, etc.\n\nThe proposed project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative nutrition services through the support of static health and nutrition facilities in Heliwa and Kaxda districts in Banadir region. The project activities will be implemented within SOS hospital in Heliwa and Community health center in Kahda The SOS nutrition teams will provide a systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTS, TSFP and Stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those children with SAM and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the SOS stabilization centre in Heliwa and other SCs in the nearest location in Kahda district. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female prioritizing the disabled children to benefit from the nutrition services. The nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality in the target districts. \n\n  Furthermore, the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and UNICEF IEC risk communication and print it in local language- Somali as well general awareness child protection prevention messages. The project will also ensure frontline health workers are well equipped and protected by distributing Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) including facemasks, handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers, soaps, gloves, etc.\n\nFinally, SOS will carry out the proposed activities in an integrated manner with other sectors such as Health, Food Security, WASH and Child Protection to promote synergy, and to address the underlying and root causes of acute malnutrition. Effects will be made to prevent occurrence of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) by collaborating with available mechanisms in the target locations. Gender mainstreaming will be fully ensured in the community mobilization events, service provision and for the training of staff and other project stakeholders. Data for the beneficiaries will be disaggregated by age and sex. SOS will promote full participation of women, girls and boys, in the project planning, monitoring and implementation to promote their voices are heard and are taken into account including communication preferences. A particular focus will be given to ensure participation of people with special needs or with disabilities by targeting 10% of the total target population in both districts.\n\nAt the end of the project, SOS will provide the following interventions\n\tScreening of 10903 children (4361 boys, 6542 girls) and 826 PLW for acute malnutrition \n\tTreatment of 7268 children MAM and SAM \n\tTreatment of 1000 SAM with complication \n\tIYCF counselling and promotion messages\n\tMNS \n\tCapacity building of staff, MOH/BRA and CNWs",

        "description": "Despite marginal improvements from \u2018critical\u2019 levels in the overall nutrition situation in Somalia, malnutrition rates among children remained precarious at \u2018serious levels. Of concern were populations with critical prevalence of acute malnutrition above the threshold of 15 per cent, mainly in Northern Inland Pastoral Livelihood Zone (Lasanod District), as well as internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to food insecurity, high morbidity, low immunization and Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. ANPPCANSOM emergency response plan will scale up treatment of malnutrition and reach an estimated caseload of 1,407 SAM representing 50% of the nutrition cluster SAM burden of 2,806 in Lasanod District. \nThe project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from moderate and severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the Lasanod Stabilization Center run by MSF using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will support and manage 3 health centers (Tuulo Samakaab, Halhaliye, Dan )and 2 mobile teams  covering 20 remote sites (Biriqodey, Bixin, Burowadal, Buulal, Fardhidin, Gacandar, Garac Lagu Dhal, God Qaboobe, Higlo Fiqi, Faleeryale  Canjiid, Laas Magugle, Jidbaale, Kalax, Sango Jabiye, Karin Dabayl, Saha Gebogebo, Buq-Xaar, Adhicadeeye, Akuule) within Lasanod district. \nIn order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCHs. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somalia Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to the target communities including internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach in Lasanod district areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project. \nThe project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. \n\nIn order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.\nLikewise, the project will give particular emphasis on the current COVID-19 pandemic prevention measure to contain the spread of the virus. Gender and protection activities will be effectively mainstreamed into the project. Every effort will be made to ensure equity and to reach the most vulnerable population in Lasanod District.",

        "description": "FSNAU 2020 post Deyr assessment indicates both GAM and SAM are serious with aggravating factors.  Food security is expected to worsen. The poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains led to the inadequate pasture, water resources and below average crop production. Weather predictions point towards a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall from April to June due to the La Nina effect. \nThe key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional and stable health system. Tied to that is scarce availability of health professionals and poor community literacy levels (UNICEF 2019 OCHA 2020). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease. \nServices in Dhobley barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure . Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2020SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2021).  Water shortage has already been reported in Dhobley with population displaced due to water shortage. This is expected to get worse if the predicted La Nina manifests next month (OCHA, 2021)\nWomen and children urgently need integrated services targeting prevention and treatment of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition.  WRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project by WFP that focuses on treatment of moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM) and maternal, child health and nutriton (MCHN) at health facilities . These services have not integrated treatment of  severe acute malnutrition (SAM) therefore children with SAM  are left untreated and so at risk of death. WFP funded project also lacks key primary prevention interventions like Micro nutrient supplementation for children 6-59 months and PLW, de worming and IYCF support. Integrating these services will  contribute to significant reduction in prevalence of malnutrition and related mortality.\nThe project will apply the grant strategy and help achieve cluster objective 2 of providing life saving interventions especially for those affected by drought like conditions. It focuses on scaling up and fully integrating nutrition interventions that will ensure full treatment of acute malnutrition.The proposed project will link to SHF's 2021 allocation strategy, the fund's strategic objectives and cluster specific objectives. We hope this will bring down the effects of the prevailing triple threat of COVID 19, floods and Desert Locusts , in addition to the most recent predicted La Nina, on acute malnutrition state. \nWRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project funded by WFP that covers treatment of Moderate acute malnutrition, MCHN and a relief project. The proposed project will bring in treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition thus ensuring full treatment of acute malnutrition at one stop. Beneficiaries will not be referred to other facilities and/or partners, which sometimes complicates treatment by increasing defaulters. This project will also support primary prevention interventions not covered by WFP project, which are very vital. These will include Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) support and micro nutrient supplication for both children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). This proposed project seeks to scale up and integrate treatment of acute malnutrition through a fixed site in Dhobley,being in a health facility. which will of will offer TSFP for treatment of MAM,OTP for treatment of  uncomplicated SAM and Stabilization center for treatment of complicated SAM, all these with prevention interventions. There will also be 1 mobile team to cover IDP  and hard to reach rural areas with treatment of MAM and uncomplicated SAM integrating  prevention interventions.",

In Ceelwaq nutrition situation of district continues to deteriorate further with limited humanitarian assistance. Post day 2020 released by FSNAU in Februar 2021 indicated that a chronic high level of acute malnutrition in Elwak district. The target areas have many challenges contributing to acute malnutrition particularly rural areas where access is constrained. The Desert Locust has caused significant damage to 2020 pastures and grassing land for livestock\u2019s which the backbone liveliho of communities in Ceelwaq. The latest forecasts indicate that Desert Locust continues to pose a very high risk to rural livelihoods across Somalia in 2021, potentially exacerbating the impact of the anticipated below-average 2021 Gu rains. The Nutrition Cluster estimates caseloads of about 300 SAM and 2120 MAM annually in the Ceelwaq district with an estimated population of about 30,689 population PESS. HDC is an active nutrition/health partner and currently implementing EAC simplified protocol in partnership with UNICEF as well HIV-Global fund emergency health in Ceelwaq general hospital, Dhamasa and Hosqurun MCHs in Ceelwaq district. In Decembe 2020, UNICEF emergency projects, Covid 19, emergency primary health and implementation of the expanded admission criteria of acute malnutrition to the outpatient therapeutic program EAC that supported health and nutrition intervention in Ceelwaq district implemented by HDC came to a end. This left a gap in health and nutrition in three-way district. The Proposed project will therefore bridge the major essential nutrition service gap that currently exists in Ceelwaq following the ended UNICEF and HDC PD out of the integrated health and nutrition Project. The project will address the identified gaps in nutrition, enhancing access to nutrition services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations. These specific needs have been outlined in the HRP and FSNAU and UNOCHA mulita cluster need rapid assessment gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. HDC will work with MOH-Federal, JSS-MOH to address the nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls, and persons living with physical disabilities in the targeted district. 2 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated and hard to reach populations in Ceelwaq district. Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with MAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be referred to HDC Managed district hospital supported by UNICEF before but still functional supporting by HDC. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the SCs that HDC propose to support in Ceelwaq district hospital and Damase referral health center in Ceelwaq district. However, we are facing a shortage of funding to sustain the existing nutrition services. Through this project, HDC is planning to maintain and support the existing nutrition services (2 fixed OTP, 1 stabilization center in the Ceelwaq general hospital with integration of health projects and one mobile teams into reaching 6 villages comprising IDPs and Hard to reach rural population mostly affected by crises in Elwak district. This nutrition intervention will build on HDC's ongoing emergency nutrition and health interventions in high risks areas in Ceelwaq district and will support the continuation of essential life-saving treatment in the context of COVID and other ongoing outbreaks in line with IMAM guideline.",

        "description": "This project seeks to mitigate protection risks exacerbated by evictions through a wide of integrated prevention and response initiatives. It is also designed to increase access to information and specialised services, which displaced communities required to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of their HLP and other rights. This will also entail identifying pressing capacity gaps and supporting state institutions and administrative structures to systematically address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion in target communities.\n\nThe proposed action builds on NRC\u2019s hands-on expertise in HLP programming in Somalia, and targeting 4030 households in Kismayo, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced affected communities HLP rights and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of long-lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities to reduce the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthen tenure security among displaced communities at the highest risk of eviction, and consolidate the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include the following:\n-\tprovision of reliable and up-to-date information and specialised services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights \n-\texpanding access to tenure security through documentation and technical support monitoring and mapping of evictions trends \n-\tsupporting the Kismayo Evictions Taskforce to lead in evictions response and programming and helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash \n-\tstrengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities\n-\tprovision of legal counselling, assistance and representation \n-\tcapacity-building trainings for rights holders, decision-makers and duty bearers on HLP and\n-\tadvocacy and undertaking comprehensive assessments and surveys, leading to the development of action plans and informing planned relocations.\n\nThe centrality of Housing, Land and Property (HLP) assistance is a key component to achieving lasting durable solutions for Displacement Affected Communities (DACs). Sustainable (re)integration remains unattainable without securing access to land, improving security of tenure and reducing the threat of evictions. Against this backdrop, there are multiple challenges linked to accessing HLP rights by DACs that exist. The HLP challenges are created by repeated, protracted displacement in urban areas exacerbated by the high demand (in the context of rapid urbanisation, investment and development) and skyrocketing land prices. This has been compounded by competing claims on land coupled with limited legal and policy frameworks around HLP rights, inadequate technical and functional capacities of state institutions, and weak mechanisms for resolving HLP disputes. Besides, DACs lack knowledge of their HLP rights and how to exercise them, and women\u2019s access to HLP rights is adversely affected due to discriminatory customs.",

        "description": "Since the beginning of 2020, additional shocks, extensive floods, desert locust infestations, the COVID-19 pandemic and drought have had compounding effects, further deteriorating already compromised systems and gains that had already been made in the economy. The secondary impacts have impacted directly the well-being of children with the rise of negative coping mechanisms being witnessed and reported such as rise in child marriage, psychological distress, sexual violence and other harmful practices. According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview (2021) children and adolescents in Somalia are targets of killing, maiming and abduction, recruitment into armed groups, detention, sexual and physical violence. Boys are at an elevated risk of recruitment to armed groups. The actual extent of grave violations of children\u2019s rights is higher than what is reported and verified. Separated and unaccompanied children are at heightened risk of various forms of violence, exploitation and abuse. While some have been placed into alternative care arrangements, a large number live alone or in the street. COVID-19 and the drought situation has stretched the foster families providing alternative care to the children. The Child Protection AoR assessment in 2020 carried out among partners also reported that children were expressing aggressive behaviors which point out to psychological distress stemming from the dire living conditions at home. IA recent study conducted by WVI in Luuq and other neighboring districts revealed that the market places, water points were some of the places identified by both IDPs and host communities as unsafe for children. The major child protection concerns identified during this study included child labour, child marriage, school dropout and sexual violence. These results are   corroborated by the education cluster reports that indicated that children are out of school in Gedo region as a result of drought with about 6000 primary school children affected. This project has been designed to respond to these needs through risk mitigation and prevention of violations of children rights and addressing child protection needs through case management. Leveraging on already existing health, WASH and Food and Cash Assistance projects in Luuq, this project\u2019s interventions have been designed to synergize efforts to deliver well-coordinated interventions to address the child protection needs. This presence of WVI staff in Luuq and the existing connection with community structures already provides registered vulnerable people groups for this project to build on. Prevention of violations and risk mitigation through a community led process has been factored including capacity building plans for self-protection among the children and their care givers. Awareness raising on the child protection and equipping of care givers with positive parenting skills is provided for to ensure children associated with armed forces and armed groups are safely re-integrated within their households and community.  To increase access to specialized child protection services either directly or through referral, update and dissemination of the referral pathway is one of the key intervention planned for to raise awareness among service providers and the community for quick and timely response. Provision for MHPSS at individual and group level has been created to meet the needs of children across different ages. Home visits will be facilitated by the care givers to meet the needs of children with disability to ensure they are not left out. Child Friendly Spaces as a measure for MHPSS has also been included in the project. COVID-19 control measures of hand washing and provision of masks for the children will be done. Screening before admission will also be done with the CFS being equipped with thermometers. Through these activities, 1300boys, 1650girls, 850men, 1100 women and 354 of persons with disability 50M,60W,122B and122G will be reached.",

        "description": "The situation of people affected by displacement and disasters remains precarious with respect to physical safety and dignity. As a result of destitution, women, men, girls and boys, are exposed to particular and various forms of violence, exploitation and discrimination. Frequent protection risks reported on the ground include (i) GBV, (ii) forced evictions, (iii) exposure to explosive hazards and (iv) child rights violations, such as child recruitment by armed groups and early marriage. Displacement increases the risk of family separation, and currently, there is an estimated caseload of 8,000 unaccompanied or separated children in Somalia. Furthermore, due to the loss of men\u2019s livelihoods, displaced women are increasingly taking on the role of breadwinners, which exposes them to the increased risk of domestic violence.\nIn a country where violence has been ongoing since 1991, persons with disabilities face extreme hurdles in being recognized, accessing resources and feeling valued in their community. This is particularly true for children and women with disabilities. Persons with disabilities in Somalia are side-lined in every aspect of humanitarian response and are being denied their economic, social and cultural rights. Reports show that persons with disabilities in Somalia are often denied access to water, food, sanitation and accommodation through lack of explicit inclusion\nAccordingly, Somalia marginalized minority communities are facing disaster human and humanitarian situation, extreme poverty and hunger which can lead is causing slow collective death, as members of these communities, especially women youth and children are suffer most from various forms human rights abuse, social and economic deprivation, including hunger and malnutrition, inadequate healthcare, limited access to education, and low self-esteem etc. Due to the above reasons, the minorities are the neediest group of people facing worst starvation, highest poverty rates, massive displacement, huge unemployment figures, highest illiteracy levels and horrific health and sanitation status. Unlike other clans from dominant groups, minorities lack international support due the prolonged Somali conflict which creates an environment where minority groups are vulnerable and abnormally displaced from their homes. Therefore, they suffer grievous human rights violations, which included extra judicial killings, appropriation of lands and properties, and forced displacement from their lands to IDP or refugee camps situated along the Somalia Ethiopia border. \nPopulation estimates indicate that of the 9.3 million people in Somalia, over 400,000 (4.3% of the population) are aged 60 or over.4 Nearly half the population 3.7 million people are now in crisis. Amongst them are approximately 160,000 people aged 60 and over (UNHCR) Practices and approaches that neither recognize their potential nor incorporate their needs place older men and women in a vulnerable situation. Older people\u2019s vulnerabilities stem from lack of opportunities, services and exclusion. There is also growing feminization of the older population as women outlive men leaving many widowed older women. However, gender bias and discrimination can place older women in a very vulnerable situation with few projects targeting older women. Whilst many of the challenges faced by older persons are also faced by other community members, for instance water storage, collection of firewood and limited opportunities for livelihoods, the implications of these challenges can be much greater for older men and women, due to age-related vulnerabilities.",

Interventions will be implemented jointly by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and Horn of Africa Peace Network (HAPEN), NoFYL and SEDHURO. DRC will implement both general protection and WASH components. While HAPEN will implement Shelter/NFI components, NoFYL will implement CCCM and HLP components while SEDHURO will carry out the Child Protection component. DRC and HAPEN had originally entered into a teaming agreement for the implementation of project but with the approval of NoFYL and SEDHURO as implementation partners, active collaboration and coordination with the two organizations will be explored. The integrated approach by the 4 organizations, will create synergies, utilize agency expertise and community networks to access and provide adequate and quality services to the most vulnerable members of the community. \n\n\nThe proposed DRC intervention is designed to contribute to the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the efforts to address the needs of most vulnerable displacement affected communities with a focus on Belet Xaawo district, Gedo region which is a key location targeted by SHF allocation strategy in 2021. The intervention will promote Protection as a central part of programming and will incorporate continuous awareness creation, analysis of protection risks, training amp follow up for effective implementation in line with the Centrality of Protection Strategy 2020-2021 adopted by the HCT in June 2020. Specifically, the project will strengthen the protection of most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men affected by climatic shocks, conflict and COVID-19 by reducing risks and vulnerabilities and increasing community capacities. It will also address needs exacerbated by the ongoing pre-drought conditions as a result of poor rainfall, impact of floods in 2020 and the ongoing locust infestation. The project will employ participatory and community-based and right based approaches as well as age, gender, diversity and inclusion to ensure vulnerable communities receive adequate and quality responses. Key interventions will include protection monitoring and assessments, strengthening of existing referral pathways. Community based mechanisms will be strengthened to prevent and respond to protection concerns. \n\n\nWASH activities will focus on both immediate and sustainable intervention that include improved access to safe water. DRC will carry out rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures, construction of new water infrastructures, water trucking, establishment of gender balanced water management committees, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects, installation of new sanitation facilities (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) in settlements hosting newly displaced population and hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.)\nThe project will target to reach 30,000 individuals\u2019 people (7000 men, 8000, women, 7000 boys, 8000 girls).",

        "description": "This project will focus on improving the physical protection and dignity of IDPs in Baidoa through the provision of 50 Transitional Shelters (piloting 5 different Shelter typologies) in Awal Barwaqo at Hanano Zone and Keerow Margan-2 at ADC Zone where both communities own their land permanently, NRC through ICLA Programs have supported them with individual land title deeds. Besides construction of 50 Transitional Shelters, 575 HHs will also be supported in Baidoa through provision of locally purchased Non-Food Items (NFIs) through cash, provision of 575 Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) to the same HHs through cash, settlement (re)planning training to reduce congestion, overcrowding and provide dignified living to beneficiaries. \n\nIn order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in Baidoa and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called 'Kobo Tool box' to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with 'Do No Harm' principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $213 (80% or $170 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $43 as the second installment) for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . Beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . This criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use monitoring and evaluation (MampE) tools, that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. Thus, in total, 625 HHs (575 through ESK, 575 through NFIs and 50 HH through Transitional Shelters) or 3,750 individuals (50% females) will be assisted in Baidoa through this project. A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash, impact of the response and to generate lessons learned for future programming. Similarly, for the transitional shelters, a post construction monitoring exercise will be conducted after 3 month of the construction completion.",

The camps have been selected on the basis of need, high proportion of the newly arrived, lack of similar support and accessibility. The needs of the beneficiaries have been identified through a joint rapid needs assessment conducted by HAPEN and DRC in March 2021.\n\nThe target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) are living in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that compromise their privacy, physical security and protection from weather extremes. The families lack adequate access to NFIs, having lost them during displacement.\n\nHAPEN will distribute Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) and non-food items (NFI) kits to 2333 households, including 230 host households who are equally vulnerable in the interest of Do-No Harm principle and in support of reintegration. An owner-driven approach in the construction of shelters where beneficiaries are assisted and capacitated to undertake the construction. The process will enable them to undertake basic repairs using local materials or rebuild their shelters in future, thus contributing to sustainability of the benefits beyond the project period. On monitoring, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution of NFIs and ESKs respectively. The exercises will provide beneficiary feedback on project effectiveness and will target 90% of the beneficiaries to ensure proper representation and accuracy.\n\nTo ensure accountability, HAPEN will establish community response and feedback mechanisms (CRFM) in the targeted sites. This will be comprised of a CRFM desk and a hotline to offer a channel for beneficiaries to register concerns. \n\nHAPEN will work closely with local administration to plan distribution points, schedules and instill order during the exercises to minimize protection risks. The timing and locations of all distributions will put the safety of women, girls, boys, elderly, disabled and those with limited mobility into consideration. Distribution exercises will be done within reasonable daylight hours. Distances to distribution sites and facilities provided by the project will be minimal and safe. It will be made clear that support provided by the project will be at no cost to the beneficiaries, hence no favours should be solicited from beneficiaries. COVID-19 prevention measures will be observed at all points where project requires beneficiaries, leaders or partners to gather. In general, the project will address protection risks and inclusion of women, disabled and minorities at all stages.\n\nCommunity structures including project community committees will play key roles in decision making, implementation and monitoring of activities and will be comprised of men, women and representatives of the disabled and the minority. \n\nIn particular, this project will closely coordinate and harmonize with Protection, WASH, CCCM and Housing, Land amp Property (HLP)  interventions to be implemented by other partners (DRC, SEDHURO and  NOFYL)  in the same district or camps and in general all other initiatives in the district to ensure complementarity. Under the coordination arrangements, organizations implementing different projects will plan together and share information during the selection of beneficiaries to avoid duplication.",

The target group will be carefully selected from protracted and newly arrived IDPs in overcrowded settlements at-risk of Covid 19 outbreak. Special priority will be accorded to households in deplorable shelter conditions, the evicted, those who have lost household items and shelter due to disasters, persons with disabilities, female headed households and people from marginalized groups. \n\nUnder the proposed initiative, 1,120 kit-based Non-Food Items (NFIs) will be distributed to 1,120 households (6,720 persons) in Banadir. In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain core items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Disbursement of relief items will be need-based, and will be decided in close coordination with the Shelter Cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In addition to NFIs, 1,120 registered households (6,720 will also receive emergency shelters. To ensure complementarity, the same group who received the NFIs will receive the emergency shelters. Site planning will be an integral part of the shelter development process, thus ensuring that adequate separation between individual households exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. Before construction of emergency shelters, AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years.   \n\nFull beneficiary details including name, settlement and contact information will be captured to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. A Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in Banadir where AVORD is implementing other programs, and with other humanitarian partners to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

These interventions are based on the 2021 allocation strategy paper, 2021 Jubaland Drought Risk Assessment findings, and the proposed activities are well aligned with the Health and WASH cluster priorities.\nThe project aims to improve access for health services to mitigate, control and manage outbreaks (waterborne diseases) and filling critical gaps, while also addressing safe water and sanitation provision through emergency/ lifesaving WASH interventions and enhancing better hygiene practices in Kismayo district. This project will reach 22,000  beneficiaries (men: 5,060, women: 5,500, boys:5,500 , girls: 5,940) over nine (9) months.\nThe health component will seek to support two (2) mobile health teams to ensure provision of emergency and essential primary health care services with emphasis on waterborne disease mitigation, control and management. SC will support the mobile health teams to provide emergency reproductive health services for underserved with referral pathways established for Gender Based violence (GBV) and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) linkages. Provision of essential medication and supplies (including Personal Protective equipment (PPEs) and COVID-19 related supplies) will be ensured for the mobile teams with well-integrated patient safety protocols as well as accessibility and accountability mechanisms. SC will also support provision of essential routine immunization services. To ensure preventative measures for diseases and outbreaks, SC will actively support community engagement and health education (with integrated hygiene messages) to community members of different sex, age and disability groups in a dignified manner.\nFor the WASH component, SC plans to conduct water trucking through vouchers to 8,889 drought affected settlements, rehabilitate 5 shallow wells, and 1 extension of existing water infrastructure. The project will also increase access to communal latrines and hand-washing with soap through construction of 56 culture sensitive latrines while addressing specific needs of different sex and disability groups to ensure safety and easy access to facilities. Additionally, beneficiaries of the water and sanitation and health services will be sensitized on hygiene promotion measures with a focus on proper hand washing with soap, safe waste and excreta disposal and household (HH) water treatment and safe storage, distribute 3666 hygiene kits including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.) to vulnerable households and build community resilience and increase sustainability of WASH services by enhancing the capacity of village level WASH management committees to manage, operate and maintain WASH facilities.\nThe project is designed to ensure equitable access to WASH services by older people and those with disabilities, safety of children and dignity and privacy for women and girls. Coordination with health and WASH clusters at national and state levels will be maintained, in addition to ongoing coordination with general key actors in Lower Juba. The project will address gender issues through collecting sex and age disaggregated data which will be analyzed to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Protection of beneficiaries will be ensured during access and utilization of services seeking to reduce further risks.\nSC aims to increase access to clean and safe drinking water, sanitation and improve hygiene knowledge and promote the adoption of safe hygiene practices among the communities, contributing to a reduced risk of disease outbreak and acute needs.",

        "description": "Somalia is currently facing a severe water shortage following the poor performance of 2020 short rains (Deyr) and the subsequent abnormally high temperatures, heightening fears of deepening humanitarian crisis in 2021. 2020 Deyr season rainfall was characterized by delays and erratic distribution. Overall, the rainfall was below average in most parts of the country with adverse impact on replenishment of water sources.\n\n4.6 million people remain in need of humanitarian WASH assistance in Somalia in 2021 with 2.5 million of them facing acute need of water and sanitation services (FSNAU Technical Release, February 2021). Poor performance of short rains (Oct-Dec) caused water shortages in Sool, Sanaag and South Central Somalia causing displacement of pastoral communities. Of the people in need and highly vulnerable, a large percentage are children, women and the elderly, who critically lack access to clean water and are acutely at risk of gender-related violence and high morbidity and mortality due to water-borne disease outbreaks. Many households lack access to adequate sanitation leading to frequent open defecation while safety of people, particularly women and children to access latrines and water points remains a serious concern and a serious risk for exposure to violence.\n\nACTED will therefore respond to this augmented risks and crisis through a WASH and market based intervention in Lascanod district, Sool region. Through this intervention, ACTED will reach a total of 3,001 households (18,010 individuals) in the proposed area of intervention. In order to create synergies and ensure sequencing, layering and integrating of programming, ACTED will complement the proposed intervention with a current USAID-BHA integrated programme in the target areas. \n\nACTED will respond to the aggravated risk through a comprehensive WASH intervention in eight hard to reach villages in Lascanod district, Sool region. This intervention will serve a total of 3,001 households (18,010 individuals). ACTED intends to construct one new borehole in Dhabansar village,  while inTuulo-samakaab ACTED will rehabilitate one borehole. Additionally, targeting the construction of 40 flood-resistant latrines with hand washing stations in Lascanod, district. 30% of the total target latrines to be constructed will be completed through the market based scheme in seeking to enhance WASH market systems and increase the purchasing power of the affected population. Regarding hygiene, ACTED intends to include hygiene promotion sessions and hygiene kit distribution through a voucher system. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable IDP communities, whilst establishing relationships with the target communities for continued maintenance and operation of these assets.",

Increase access to, utilisation and quality of health and nutrition services at community, primary and secondary health levels, especially for women, children and vulnerable populations and; 2. Strengthen the health system under the stewardship of the Somali Health Authorities (SHAs). The project\u2019s approach focuses on strengthening the SHAs\u2019 capacity at the regional, district and community levels to deliver the EPHS (core services 1-6). Lessons from Joint Health Nutrition Programme (JHNP) and other programmes, identified a critical management gap at the district level in Banadir. A core focus of the project\u2019s methodology is therefore to support the Regional health Officer (RHO) in Banadir to establish and develop a District Health Management Team (DHMT) in each of the 10-targeted districts. Having an operational management body at district level, within the SHA structure, will be an essential component of ensuring that the health facilities and community/female health workers (CHWs/FHWs), in their respective districts, are able to receive the technical, management and logistical support required for them to successfully deliver integrated, quality, health and nutrition services that the population can access. This is a structure and model that has been demonstrated to be successful in other health systems (e.g. in Kenya). The consortium will work closely with the RHO throughout the project to establish, develop and support the DHMTs.",

While international donors, including Canada, have already stepped up with humanitarian assistance to save lives and protect livelihoods, a significant funding gap persists and humanitarian needs are expected to escalate well into 2017. The impact is most pronounced in Ethiopia, which experienced its worst drought in 50 years, leaving 10 million people in need of emergency food assistance. In the Americas, Haiti is one of the most affected countries, with a third consecutive year of drought, exacerbated by El Ni\u00f1o, leaving more than 3.6 million people food insecure. Similar impacts are being felt around the globe. To date, twenty three countries have appealed for help to meet critical needs, including food, agricultural support, and water and sanitation.  With GAC's support, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is promoting early recovery and resilience building in some of the countries worst hit by El Ni\u00f1o, including Ethiopia, Haiti, Malawi, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Although specific programming differs based on the context in each country, FAO is protecting the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable groups, such as subsistence farmers and pastoralists, with agricultural inputs and livestock support.",

        "description": "The latest findings from a countrywide seasonal assessment conducted in December 2016 by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network indicate that over 2.9 million people face Crisis and Emergency (IPC Phases 3 and 4) across Somalia through June 2017. Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo declared the drought a national disaster on 28 February 2017.\nDrought affected families are resorting to a range of negative coping strategies including reducing the number of meals eaten in a given day, skipping meals, accumulation of debts or obtaining food on credit from shops, as well as migration in search of livelihood. IDPs rely heavily on support from the host community. Besides, the maternal mortality rate for Somalia is among the highest in the world at 732 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Water shortage may also trigger further outbreak of water borne diseases.\nOxfam provides integrated EFSVL (Emergency Food Security and Vulnerable Livelihoods) and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) support to vulnerable women, men, boys and girls affected by drought in Sool, Sanaag, Toghdeer and Awdal regions as an immediate life saving intervention whilst taking steps to ensure the response contributes to the capacity building and resilience of communities and partners. Gender and protection will be mainstreamed throughout the response. The key EFSVL interventions include the distribution of cash grants to households who have lost their livestock and financial support to the Ministry of Livestock for scale upof livestock mass vaccination, control of parasites, disease surveillance and treatment of clinical cases. The key WASH interventions include the protection and development of spring and shallow wells, provision of water supply through trucking and vouchers, construction of communal latrines, hygiene promotion activities and distribution of hygiene materials.",

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s population is currently experiencing multiple shocks (\u2018triple threat\u2019 \u2013 locust, drought, COVID-19): the Desert Locust upsurge that started in late 2019  and continues to threaten the food security and livelihoods of pastoralists and farmers in many parts of the country; riverine and flash floods that affect the food security, livelihoods and safety of farmers and people living in flood-prone, populated areas; the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is having severe health and socio-economic impacts both in Somalia and globally; and the extended impact of previous shocks (flooding, drought, displacement, etc.) on livelihoods.\nAssessments by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) andFamine Early Warning SystemsNetwork (FEWSNET) also indicate that, in the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through December 2020. In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3)outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeastern Somalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.\nBesides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.\nOur proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security <(>&<)> Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation <(>&<)> Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).\nOxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban). Partners have been implementing SOMJR activities in these regions and locations since 2019 (Awdal, Sool, Sanaag) and 2020 (Bari, Mudug), and were able to invest in the resilience building of target communities. Bocaame in Sool has been added as a new location to the SOMJR: it has already been targeted by partner KAALO during the DRA-funded Desert Locust Joint Response (May to October 2020), however, needs remain high as Bocaame is highly affected by insecurity and recurring waves of desert locust invasions.",

        "description": "About 4.6 million people in Somalia are food insecure and 4.2 million are in need of humanitarian assistance. The reduction in the number of people in need since early 2018 has been attributed to favourable rainfall during the Gu season (April to June) and sustained humanitarian assistance. Over 1.5 million people face acute food security Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) and approximately 3.1 million people are Stressed (IPC 2)1. Although the 2016/2017 drought has ended in most parts of Somalia, its adverse impact lingers among those who were impoverished or displaced, and pastoralists who lost all or most of their livestock, particularly in the north. Without sustained food and livelihood assistance, the latter are likely to remain in Emergency (IPC 4).\nWhile acute malnutrition rates have improved nationally to Serious from Critical, the overall prevalence of acute malnutrition remains largely unchanged from Deyr 2017/2018. Between August and December, 294,000 acutely malnourished children, including 55,000 severe cases, aged underfive, will require treatment and integrated support. The acute malnutrition burden over the next 12 months is projected to be 588,400 acutely malnourished children, including 110,500 severe cases. The persistently high levels of acute malnutrition are unlikely toreduce without addressing the underlying causes, particularly in internally displaced persons (IDP) settlements and in some rural areas",

        "description": "WiP!\u2019s theory of change identifies three key pathways \u2013 which inform our aims \u2013 to enable young people from diverse backgrounds to generate sustainable living wages and create optimism about their future in Egypt, Nigeria and Somalia. Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

The Food Security and Livelihoods component of the project will deliver Multi-Purpose Cash to assist vulnerable households to access food and other necessities. Oxfam will collaborate with the Ministry of Livestock in a livestock vaccination campaign to treat the most common endo and ecto parasites to improve animal health in pastoralist communities, and will further work with vulnerable youth and women to diversify their livelihoods with vocational skills training and piloting of Voluntary Savings Groups. This will help increase employability and income, and will also contribute to building the capacity of women to take a more active role in decision making in their communities. The project will incorporate specific community protection activities engaging community protection volunteers, existing community committees and women#s groups to raise and mitigate protection risks at community level. Oxfam will map available services in target communities and engage with service providers on confidential referral pathways. Trainings on basic protection principles, rights and responsibilities will target community committees, women#s groups, community protection volunteers and relevant authorities will be capacity built to strengthen regional and national protection mechanisms.",

While there are so far only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Somalia (first case: 16 March 2020), it must be noted there are no testing facilities and tests are currently sent to South Africa. Results are received after two weeks. The country has only 15 intensive care unit beds and ranks 194th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index. Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced. The below activities would provide Oxfam Somalia and our partners with a top-up to the 50,000 GBP recently received through the CAT Fund.\nProject description / activities (including numbers to be reached):\nAn additional 100,000 GBP (50% as loan, 50% as grant) will enable Oxfam and our partners to scale up the WASH preparedness activities as well as support partner Shaqodoon on extending the COVID-19 helpline to Somalia#s Puntland State. Shaqodoon are currently in the process of completing the set-up of the helpline in Somaliland (with support from the current CAT Fund grant); to be launched by 11th April. The helpline in Puntland willfollow the same process as in Somaliland: Shaqodoon will develop the system and link it to a toll-free Coronavirus hotline providedby Puntland#s Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health will work closely with WHO and identify health personnel who will be trained in receiving and processing calls. Shaqodoon will provide pre-recorded health messages, on-site technical support and data analysis/dashboards for the Ministry.\n\nThe remaining amount will be utilised to scale up COVID-19 preparedness activities in Somaliland and Puntland, in collaboration with partners. Itwill also be used to top-up partners# crisis modifiers from other donors to make theircontribution in this fight, more meaningful. Activities include set-up of handwashing points in settlements, purchase and distribution of hygiene kits to IDP communities, dispatching mobile teams to disinfect busy public areas and purchase of HTH chlorine pumps for disinfection.\n\n50,000 people will be reached by Oxfam#s and partners# WASH COVID-19 preparedness activities.\nShaqodoon through the Ministry of Health of Puntland hopes to reach a majority of Puntland#s phone users with COVID-19 information sharing and prevention messaging.",

Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced. The below activities would provide Oxfam Somalia and our partners with a top-up to the 50,000 GBP recently received through the CAT Fund.\nProject description / activities (including numbers to be reached):\nAn additional 100,000 GBP (50% as loan, 50% as grant) will enable Oxfam and our partners to scale up the WASH preparedness activities as well as support partner Shaqodoon on extending the COVID-19 helpline to Somalia#s Puntland State. Shaqodoon are currently in the process of completing the set-up of the helpline in Somaliland (with support from the current CAT Fund grant); to be launched by 11th April. The helpline in Puntland willfollow the same process as in Somaliland: Shaqodoon will develop the system and link it to a toll-free Coronavirus hotline providedby Puntland#s Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health will work closely with WHO and identify health personnel who will be trained in receiving and processing calls. Shaqodoon will provide pre-recorded health messages, on-site technical support and data analysis/dashboards for the Ministry.\n\nThe remaining amount will be utilised to scale up COVID-19 preparedness activities in Somaliland and Puntland, in collaboration with partners. Itwill also be used to top-up partners# crisis modifiers from other donors to make theircontribution in this fight, more meaningful. Activities include set-up of handwashing points in settlements, purchase and distribution of hygiene kits to IDP communities, dispatching mobile teams to disinfect busy public areas and purchase of HTH chlorine pumps for disinfection.\n\n50,000 people will be reached by Oxfam#s and partners# WASH COVID-19 preparedness activities.\nShaqodoon through the Ministry of Health of Puntland hopes to reach a majority of Puntland#s phone users with COVID-19 information sharing and prevention messaging.",

        "description": "On 2nd February 2020 the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of the Federal Government of Somalia has declared a national emergency (see press statement in attachment) in view of the current Desert Locust upsurge that poses a major threat to Somalia#sfragile food security situation. Food sources for people and their livestock are at risk. The Desert Locust swarms are uncommonly large and consume huge amounts of crops and forage.\nAccording to locust office of the Ministry of Agriculture and HADMA  latest report, there were huge swarm of Desert locust from Yemen that at the end September 2019 laid eggs in many locations in Somaliland. Despite controlefforts, a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak is threatening crops and pasture across Northern Somali regions. Accordingto experts, this is the worst outbreak in over 25 years in Somalia.\n\nThe situation has rapidly deteriorated in January 2020, as weather conditions have been unusually conductive to the spread of the pest. After cyclone Pawanmade landfall in early December 2019, flooding across the Horn of Africa created favourable breeding conditions for desert locusts. These conditions allow the breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locust with the formation of large numbers of swarm as FAO indicated in their latest Appeal .\nDesert Locust breeding is ongoing in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug (Mudug). An estimated 70,000 hectares of land has been invaded by hoppers and breeding adults. Once they mature the locusts areexpected to migrate in swarms and move south towards the Ethiopian border area of Somaliland as well as Jubaland, Southwest State and Hirshabelle. These swarms will be at their most destructive stage and pose a very severe risk to Deyr season food and fodder production.\nMating adults, hoppers and swarms have been detected in Northwest Somalia (between Bulhar and Silil). Hoppers and immature adults were reported on the Northwest plateau and a swarm was detected between Burao and the Ethiopian border. Hopper bands were also reported south of Bossaso, south of Las Anod (near the Ethiopian border) and in Galmudug (near Galkayo). More swarms are likely to form along the Northwest coast and plateau, which may migrate to Djibouti, Eastern Ethiopia and SouthernSomalia.\nCrop and pastures have already been damaged in Somalia impacting negatively onagropastoral and pastoral households. In December 2019, it was reported that a huge number of desert locust (still at the stage of hopper bands) hatched in differentbreeding areas of Somaliland, such as coastal areas and farming land, posing a new devastating threat to crops and pasture lands.",

Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises.

This intervention forms approximately 70% of the total cash transfer programming under Oxfam\u2019s overall response and will be implemented directly by Oxfam by engaging electronic financial service provider in Puntland via mobile phones. Beneficiarieswho don\u2019t possess Sim-cards will receive them as part of this response and be trained on its usage. The overall Oxfam food securityintervention which this contributes towards will include additional emergency livelihoods and recovery elements including cash for work interventions to rebuild destroyed feeder roads.Oxfam targets households that meet the critical food insecurity criteria takingintoconsideration gender-differentiated needs. The selection criteria will be discussed with thetarget women, men, boys and girls toensure fairness of the selection process. Usually, women are registered as beneficiaries and the head of the household for cash transfers. At times we find that some polygamous households are includedduring registration stage and this is addressed during verification, ensuring that the most vulnerable HH are Commented [AC12]: In addition to these activities DEC funds can also be used to coverany hygiene promotion activities/hygiene kits, COVID messaging, PPE for staffif needed?Commented [MH13R12]: We Have some PPE in thefield, Moses to add purchase of some PPE in the budget\ntargeted, in collaboration with community leaders. Female-headed households are the most affected as they do not have access to meaningful household assets such as livestock, or other sources of income. In Bari region, priorities for livelihood regeneration activities are different for women and men. Oxfam will deliver emergency food security interventions through cash grants for the most vulnerable people, while supporting household income by strengtheningand diversifying livelihoods through other projects. Oxfam's programming since March 2017 has successfully diversified the source of livelihoods in traditional pastoralist communities in Somaliland with plansto replicate this expereicnce in Puntland. This intervention will help vulnerable households to have some disposable income which they can use to purchase or meet their household food needs.Most vulnerable community members that will be most in need of the emergency assistance through this action will be identified through participatory mapping exercises conducted at village level through specific exercises including well-being rankings, vulnerability mapping, food consumption score, household purchasing power, among others. Gender will be consideredwhen selecting households to help reduce the additional burden on women headedhouseholds. The criteria shall be clearly explained to the selection committee/panel prior toselection, with clearcommunication on what beneficiaries will be entitled to during the project, to avoid unrealistic expectations.",

        "description": "Somalia is in the process of transitioning from a 'failed' to a 'fragile' state with central and recognised governemental institutions. To date, the country remains divided by various political and clan factions and strong anti-governement elements who are benefiting from the availability remnants or war (ERW) such as landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) thereby significantly weakening the overall stability and security in Somalia. This project seeks to reduce the impact of landmines, unsecured ammunition stockpiles, UXO and other ERW have at regional level. Phase one will target Northern Somalia (Somaliland) where large clearance efforts are coming to an end in the next three years and where, until clerarance is completed, accidents will continue to affect rural communities. HALO will deploy four manual clerance teams and one mechanical team to clear 616,000m2 from 1 Setember 2016 to 31 December 2018. Phase two will take place in Southern Somalia where government credibility has been gradualy increasing and where making concrete steps to restore stability can significantly foster state's legitimacy. International funding for HMA in Somalia is contributing to the multilateral effort to stabilise Southern Somalia by addressing factors leading Somali populations to migrate to Europe in search of better futures. HALO\u2019s work in Southern Somalia began in 2015, and a process of slow, steady development is being undertaken to minimize risks to the programme.",

The political will to end AIDS is receding as governments deal with multiple challenges including nationalism, populism, conflict and instability. These challenges contribute to increasingly polarised societies. However, globally there are still 38 million people living with HIV and in 2019 there were 1.7 million new infections.\n\nKey population groups (such as LGBTQI+ people, sex workers, people who use drugs) and their partners, and adolescent girls and young women are most affected by HIV, and account for the majority of new infections. Globally, the total number of new HIV infections has hardly declined for several years, stagnant at 1.7 million since 2018. This is far above the UNAIDS target of 500,000 per year by 2020 and reflects a worsening picture.\n\nIn 2019, for the first time, key population groups and their partners accounted for the majority (62%) of all new infections worldwide. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa, regions where the epidemic is expanding, key population groups accounted for almost all new infections.",

Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert.

In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden bereits Vorstudien erstellt.

Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt. Zur Finanzierung des Vorhabens stellt das BMZ insgesamt 23,24 Mio. EUR aus FZ-Altmitteln und einer neuen bilateralen Zusage bereit. Angesichts der gro\u00dfen Bedarfe in den drei Projektst\u00e4dten erfolgte dar\u00fcber hinaus eine Vorratspr\u00fcfung in H\u00f6he von 50 Mio. EUR.",

The project takes place in two phases: First completing the manual clearance of Somaliland at which point mine action in Somaliland will become completely owned funded and implemented by national authorities with su\nfficient capacity to tackle any residual tasking. Finland has supported this project since 2003. Second HALO will seek and destroy community held or abandoned stockpiles of ammunition held outside of state control across their area of operations in Souther\nn Somalia. The primary beneficiaries of the project are local populations in areas where HALO will conduct mine clearance and stockpile destruction. Finland will support HALO?s project in Somalia during 2017-2020 with one million euros.",

Tavanomaisille laakkeille vastustuskykyisen TB:n (MDR-TB) lisaantyminen on globaali uhka ja sen vastainen tyo Somaliassa hyodyttaa kaikkia maita. Toinen keskeinen ongelma on alhainen \nhoidon kattavuus ? vain n. 37% sairastuneista paasee hoitoon ja levittavat siten tautia edelleen. Hankkeen vaikutustavoitteita ovat: a) MDR-TB:n nujertaminenb) tuberkuloosiin sairastuneiden parempi tavoittaminen. Somalian tuberkuloositaakkaa pyritaan vahen\ntamaan seuraavin tavoin:1.

Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM.

Finn Church Aid (FCA) in partnership with the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers is implementing a  \nMideeye project. The project works for a more stable and peaceful Somalia recognizing that genuine national reconciliation and inclusive governance are two reinforcing and interrelated processes crucial for peace and state building.  FCA and the Network fo\nr Religious and Traditional Peacemakers have been active in mediation and local-level democratization and institution building in Somalia for several years. Since 2017 FCA has supported the ministry responsible for the implementation of the National Reconc\niliation Framework (NRF) at the request of the Somali government. Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland has supported the FCA?s reconciliation project with 13 million Euros during the years 2018-2021. External evaluation from the year 2020 states that th\ne project has been highly successful in achieving the central objective to establish a NRF and to advance reconciliation. Funding for Mideeye project is part of MFA's Country Programme for Somalia. Mideeye project is in line with Country Programme's object\nives concerning state building and peace building. The support for the Mideeye project is 45 million euros for the years 2021-2024.",
