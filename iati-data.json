Alliance is focused on unlocking the economic potential of young women and men in Egypt, Nigeria and Somalia.The project aims to enable them to generate sustainable and reasonable incomes \u0096 by finding regular employment or by them starting an enterprise.\nThe project has a holistic approach because a job alone does not guarantee a successful life in one\u0092s own country: 1)It is gender sensitive and inclusive: the programme aims to have 50% of the actively engaged youths be women. Forthe other 50% the programme focuses on the specific needs and participation of young men. 2) It focuses both on the supply and the demand in the labourmarket, and tries to link enterprises and job-seeking youths. 3) And it aims to change policies and develop an enabling environment: advocacy for enabling policies and having role models advocate for youth participation in decision making and at the labour market.\nThe most important goal of \"Work in Progress!\" is to improve the skills of young people and their economic prospects by creating jobs and stimulating entrepreneurship.

Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue.

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR.

        "description": "The project builds on the previous TB intervention implemented by LSV. However in order to increase effectiveness totally new strategies will be applied.TB continues to be an essential health problem in Somalia. The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rathe\nr new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the privat\ne sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration \nwith the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and \nparticipation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB cult\nure services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to \nTB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO\n called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The \nproject will help the poorest of the poor. For example many cases are found among people who suffer from malnutrition.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017.

        "description": "IOM MIDA Finnsom IV project focuses on contributing to improved health outcomes in Somaliland and particularly its remote regions. To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three out\nputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Local health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

At HH and group level, the program will continue to expand the number of VSLAs, increasing the number of these social capital-developing and integration-promoting mechanisms.  Through the intensive GCVCA facilitated assessment process and subsequent development of CAAPs, SomReP will continue to place the community at the forefront of analyzing their own challenges and opportunities, and putting forth their own priorities and plans to help them better plan for and mitigate against shocks and promote food security and economic development.  The CAAP is the foundation for development planning at the community level, assisting community leadership to identify and prioritize development actions. Other organizations and consortia are also developing plans at community and district level; as such, SomReP will continue to jointly plan and coordinate actions at both Technical Unit and site level so as to ensure efficient use of multipledonors# resources in fulfillment of community needs.\nIn partnership with district and Member State line ministries, SomReP will undertake sector specific assessments targeting systems (e.g. water systems, market systems) which affect resilience buildingwithin and between villages.  During times of shock, SomReP will mobilize resources to partner with relevant line ministries to undertake assessment to support early response and post-shock recovery.  Village and village-cluster plans will be aggregated and support the development of district-level planning frameworks.  Through direct support to line ministries through secondments and other facilitative actions, the program will promote understanding of national and Member State Level frameworks (NDP andRRF) at the community planning level.  As Member State line ministries are supported to monitor uptake and progress towards achieving disaster risk management actions at community level, the government will both fulfill its mandate and begin to strengthen its ability to do this independently.",

The reduction in the number of people in need since early 2018 has been attributed to favourable rainfall during the Gu season (April to June) and sustained humanitarian assistance. Over 1.5 million people face acute food security Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) and approximately 3.1 million people are Stressed (IPC 2)1. Although the 2016/2017 drought has ended in most parts of Somalia, its adverse impact lingers among those who were impoverished or displaced, and pastoralists who lost all or most of their livestock, particularly in the north. Without sustained food and livelihood assistance, the latter are likely to remain in Emergency (IPC 4).\nWhile acute malnutrition rates have improved nationally to Serious from Critical, the overall prevalence of acute malnutrition remains largely unchanged from Deyr 2017/2018. Between August and December, 294,000 acutely malnourished children, including 55,000 severe cases, aged underfive, will require treatment and integrated support. The acute malnutrition burden over the next 12 months is projected to be 588,400 acutely malnourished children, including 110,500 severe cases. The persistently high levels of acute malnutrition are unlikely toreduce without addressing the underlying causes, particularly in internally displaced persons (IDP) settlements and in some rural areas",

        "description": "Somalia has experienced recurrent droughts since 2011 which have been increasingly exacerbated by climate change. Agro-pastoralistsand pastoralists have been badly affected by the 2019 drought which has caused widespread crop failure, water shortages, and depleted livestock levels.\nMore than 4.2 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019, and the number ofpeople who are food insecure is expected to increase in the coming months.  This year#s severe drought has been caused by abnormally hot, dry conditions during January-March and the failure of the rains in April-June. Most households are already adopting negativecoping strategies to mitigate food insecurity, including reducing food intake. Poor transportation and market infrastructure make it difficult for pastoralists to access markets, and there are few fed markets to provide animals with nutrition when natural pastures are inadequate. Over 80% of livestock was lost as a result of the 2017 drought, and the population of livestock herds, essential for pastoralists# food and income, have not yet recovered.\nThe impact of the 2019 drought on the water and sanitation sector has beensignificant. Water supply (boreholes, shallow wells) is severely limited and the cost of accessing water has increased sharply, representing a severe burden on insufficient household income. Existing groundwater sources contain a highly mineralized content, rendering it unsuitable for drinking, but a prior Oxfam needs assessment showed that the vast majority of households in the project area do not treat their water. Open defecation remains common, increasing protection risks for women and girls who venture outside alone or during the night or move far from dwellings to known open defecation areas.\nOxfam aims to assist at least 500,000 affected peoplewith immediate food security and WASH programming along with resilience and recovery interventions to diminish the impact of recurring droughts on vulnerable populations. Oxfam will embed activities to strengthen the protection of women, men, boys, and girls within the EFSVL and WASH workstreams.",

Furthermore, MoPCA has signed agreement with the Ministry of Education and Science as regards incorporating civic educationcourses into the curriculum of high primary schools, secondary schools and universities. The curriculum for the three preceding streams has been finalized recently and the teaching of the civic education is expected to begin soon.\nIn addition, MoPCA intends to train all government institutions to ensure that such institutions respect the constitutional rights of the citizens. The essence of the training of the government institutions on the constitutional rights is to enhance the protection of basic human rights and to strengthen the rule of law. So far, MoPCA has trained the Good Governance and Anti Corruption Commission as well as 1000 young men who were undertaking their National Service training at Dararweyne training school. The ministry also visited regional universities to train National Service girls who were attached to different universities to complete their national service requirements. MoPCA will continue training other government institutions on constitutional rights of the citizens.\nSimilarly, the Ministry has also distributed large quantities of the copies of the constitution as well as brochures and pamphlets aimed at raising citizens# awareness vis-\u00e0-vis their constitutional rights and their obligations as well. The ministry is also planning to visit regions and hold town-hall meetings with different citizens residing in regions. The aim of these town-hall meetings is to disseminate the constitution and to gather data as regards the views and opinions of society with respect to theirknowledge about their constitutional rights. MoPCA will also undertake consultative meetings in all regions.",

Humanitarian response focuses on WaSH, EVFSL and Protection.\nOxfam has made a lot of gains through humanitarian resilience programmes which are likely to be eroded if the desert locust menace is uncontrolled. Oxfam will therefore capitalise and work with the existing community structures such as Early Warning Committees, Government line ministries, FAO and other stakeholders on the preventive and control measures.\nOxfam will prioritize safeguarding livelihoods focusing on cash intervention and locust control measures.\n\nA total of 1,056 people in coastal areas of Sool region will be reachedby the project and supported toprotect and recover their livelihoods.\n\nOxfam has vast experience in implementing conditional and unconditional cash transfer approaches in WASH, EVFSL programmes. The project will specifically focus on the Cash for Work(CfW) approach as it not only empowers individuals to spend based on their priority needs but also focuses on revamping community assets. CfW will therefore stimulate the recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroduce income flow,supporting local businesses through the purchase worktools while also encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally. The trench digging will involve large numbers of the population and will be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in an area thus benefitting the entire community and not just a few individuals.\n\nThe project will support communities to address locust spread by burying them in trenches excavated through cash for work. A total of 1,056 people will dig 26 km of trenches and drive hopper bands through cash for work, this task will continue for 30 days, 15 days per month starting in mid-March 2020. This task is expected to minimize hopper bands probability to turn to dangerous swarm level while at the same time communities will be able to access cash to help them address food insecurity situation at household level.\n\nOxfam will closely cooperate with the Somaliland Ministry of agriculture",

While there are so far only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Somalia (first case: 16 March 2020), it must be noted there are no testing facilities and tests are currently sent to South Africa. Results are received after two weeks. The country has only 15 intensive care unit beds and ranks 194th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index. Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced.

        "description": "# Solarization of two existing water sources   in Baki and Saylac districts of Awdal benefiting more than 10,000 people and their livestock. Awdal is one of the regions affected by COVID19 as it connects Somaliland to Djibouti. The majority of people are dependent pity trades, small scale irrigation, and livestock, most of these activities have been affected, and communities reported a reduction of income. Existing water supply sources are mainly powered by a diesel generator that are purchased from the tariffs collected from the users. Associated water tariffs are sky rocking as access to diesel has reduced as restrictions are imposed on public transport. Out of the many strategic water sources, two sources are selected, supplying water for villages affected by COVID19 in Somaliland. Oxfam will install a solar system for these wells, and the action will reduce the cost of water tariff and increase community use of water for different purposes include handwashing.\n# Build the capacity of the WASH committees managing the solarizedse water sources by providing necessary tools and training them on both technical skill and financial management. This action will be led by the ministry of water department of scheme management. As we mobilize for the two sources an additional two boreholes within the sameareas will also be invited for the training. These will help to maximize use of expert time, cover nearby villages with capacity building plan and increase value for money by targeting more with same budget.\n# Support Somaliland Ministry of Water Development to ministry of water to finalize   the design and construction for WASH facilities to be shared with all WASH Cluster members in Somaliland. The national WASH cluster has prioritized this action as per the request from ministry and Oxfam will contribute for this action. The budget will be used to cover some of the consultancy fees or provide expertise to help them finalize the work.\n# Provide safeprogramming training for WaSH committees, district administrations, women groups other key stakeholders including traditional leaders    .\n# Protection awareness raising including community discussions on protection impact to address stigma and promotion of the call centre hotline   (already operational) to increase access to covid19 services for affected communities    .\n# Government capacity building/strengthen social safety net system in Somaliland : we will build the capacity of the government to be able to lead and coordinate Somaliland safety net program. Somalia launched safety net project called bahnano at Mogadishu but this has not been cascaded to Somaliland and Puntland. The government staff responsible for this are unable to run safety net due to their limited capacity. The project will target technical staff from the government and create enabling environment in the form of institutional capacity building including training of key staff, support implementation of beneficiaries selection and running coordination mechanisms smoothly.  Oxfam Somalia is implementing social safety net activity under GFFO top up. Under this activity the project aims improving supports to HHs in urban areas particularly COVID19 affected poorest or most vulnerable to prevent them to fall to poverty and destitution trap, manage COVID19 economic and social shocks and advance their lives <(>&<)> livelihoods. The government capacity in Somaliland on social safety net is to grow and as part of appeal fund, Oxfam will contribute to strengthening/establishing social protection system that leads COVID19 response project. Oxfam will partner with Somaliland Ministry of Employment, Social and Family as socialprotection responsible government body. Somaliland government capacity is yet to grow and this project will address this gap while also coordinating with other implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to be able to lead social assistance and provide at scale in the future to its society as a right. The project creates an opportunity for governments to become the standard responders to large scale crises.",

        "description": "Harhub in partnership with Oxfam is launching a social innovation challenge to tackle most pressing social issues. The partners areaiming to harness the innovations of young people in Somaliland and beyond particularly social entrepreneurs, developers, changemakers, and health practitioners keen on bringing game-changing solutions to most vital social challenges focusing on in the areas of agriculture, technology, SDGs, health, food, education, and energy. The partners believe that tackling these complex issues will require diverse skill sets, backgrounds, effort and innovation. Harhub will be prioritizing innovations which may already be proven but will reach new heights of interest within the industry given the right support from Harhub, or innovations which are new ideas and concepts, but might need some tuning to fit the requirements of potential customers.\nThrough a competitive process, Harhub will reachout to 10k youth through social media promotions to apply the program for three weeks. Harhub is expected to receive quite big and competitive projects. Whilst applicants are ongoing, Harhub will create mentors\u2019 criteria and hire 3 mentors to lead selection and the Bootcamp. All the submitted projects will be evaluated by the mentors based on the solutions\u2019 unique value proposition, social impact, visibility, technical viability, and the individuals\u2019/teams\u2019 ability and capability to scale the solution.\n\nIn total, the mentors will then select twenty most advanced and innovative projects to attendthe two full days Bootcamp to be held at Harhub. The Bootcamp will be a high-energy workshop focused on rapid ideation, refinement, and prototyping of solutions. It is a space to generate, iterate on, and test ideas for social impact, foster a culture ofinnovation through experimentation, collaboration, and expand a community of social impact innovators. In the final event, twenty finalists will pitch their solutions for a chance to win grant funding, incubation, and mentorship scheme. The top three projects will be awarded a grant fund to their projects at Harhub with all support of providing free incubation and mentorship to develop, validate, execute and scale their solutions",

According to Somaliland\u2019s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, UNDP and the World Bank reports, over 70% of Somaliland\u2019s population is under the age of 30. The unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 30 is 67% - one of the highest rates in the world. Among young women, it is even estimated at 74%. Youth in Somaliland are not just the future ofthe country, they are also the majority.\nWith 67% of the youth being out of work, the high unemployment rate forthe youth remains abig challenge in Somaliland, and this rate is even higher for young women. The unemployment rate for young women in the country is estimated to be 74%. Due to the insecurity over the last two decade and stagnant economic growth, jobs have not been created at a rate that is able to match the growth of the youth population.\nWomen often face stiff competition during business pitching/competitions and often shy away to compete with their fellow men or observe stigmatization. This conceptwill bridge this gap by specifically earmarking this Women in Tech competition for young women tech savvies to compete among each other.\nTo achieve a long lasting and sustainable economic and social transformation in the country, we must empower young women, create opportunities for prosperity and provide them with the necessary tools and resources.\nHence Innovate Ventures (IV) in partnership and collaboration with Oxfam aim to support, accelerate and grow the Somali women startup scene and accelerate the growth of women startups in technology to help them create employment opportunities, and improve the investment climate in the country",

Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises.

Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises.

        "description": "Somalia, a fragile State that is emerging from decades of civil war, is currently experiencing an unprecedented situation mainly caused by climate change, Covid-19 and locust infestation, which exacerbated the long-term existed challenges within the country including widespread vulnerability and marginalization, insecurity and government with poor institutional capacity to deliver and advocate for basic humanitarian needs of local communities, combination of the above mentioned challenges contributed to negative socio-economic impact on Somali communities and resulted in the displacement of affected populations (mainly rural) and formation of IDP sites alongside main towns.\nOther challenges encountered by Somalia and Somaliland communities include lack of coping capacity to climate change and widespread dependency created by Humanitarian Aid due to the absence of government\u2019s role that affects the livelihood of entire communities rather than building their long-term resilience. It's evident that the Humanitarian Aid Dependency has largely affected the productivity of the Somali population. However, there's need to exhaust to what extent these will be addressed by our research questions for the Participatory Action Research (PAR) on Aid Humanitarian Aid dependency.\nIn 2019, nine Somali NGOs founded the Nexus platform that aims to shape the future in Somalia and Somaliland, by creating an enabling environment for Somali NGOs to have a leading role in the humanitarian system that puts the agency and self-reliance of communities at the center, through delivering a combination of Humanitarian Aid, Development, and Peace interventions. The Nexus coalition is led by nine Somali NGOs \u2013 African Development Solutions (ADESO), Centre for Peace and Democracy (CPD), Gargaar Relief and Development Organization (GREDO), Horn of Africa Voluntary Youth Committee (HAVOYOCO), KAALO, Save Somali Women and Children (SSWC), Social-Life and Agriculture Development Organisation (SADO), Taakulo Somaliland Community (TASCO), and WASDA. Two INGOs \u2013 Oxfam and Save the Children International were invited to join as international partners to support with critical investments.\nSo far the platform developed and applied its strategy andtheory of change whilst Humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, Somalia Nexus consortium aims to focus interventions that are in line with its pillars, including Community-driven and working across the Triple Nexusof Development, Humanitarian Aid, Peace-building and conflict-resolution, as well as strengthening the capacity of Somali Civil Society <(>&<)> Government institutions. In addition, special considerations will be given concerning practicality and implementation methodology including presence, scaleof the need, duration and coordination with other stakeholders.\nThe day-to-day activities of theplatform are performed by the Secretariat supported by the Steering committee who are also responsible for resource mobilization, organizing coordination meetings, fund management and drafting policies and guidelines\nIn 2021, the Nexus platform aims to implement efforts to support its members and government institutions in both Somalia and Somaliland, through development of Community-driven Development manuals, conducting Participatory Action Research that finds durable solutions on climate related challenges in both pastoral and agro-pastoral communities, conducting PAR that aims to address the level and scope of dependency created by Unconditional Cash disbursement to local rural communities as well as supporting Somalia and Somaliland governments to develop standardized Cash Transfer model with clear guidelines.\nSocial inclusion, protection and Covid-19 protocols will be maintained and mainstreamed in project interventions.",

        "description": "COVID19 disease has been identified in China and later declared as a global pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. In Somalia and Somaliland, the first case of the disease was reported in March 2020, and since then, the government authorities implemented measures including movement restrictions, banning all community gathering, closing schools and other religious facilities. Somalia has over three million internally displaced communities (OCHA, Somalia) and over 79% of Somalis are living either below or near the internationalpoverty line (NDP-9, Somalia). The majority of IDPs live in overcrowded settlements with weakened infrastructure, insufficient access to WASH facilities and inaccessible health services. Since later last year, the locust manifestation and floods destroyed majority posture and farmland deteriorating the already weakened communities.\nSomalia is one of the worst prepared countries in the world to contain the disease. WHO recommends the use of personal protective equipment, frequent handwashing and social distance to contain COVID19. Oxfam Somalia works with communities to promote these critical measures and raise awareness of communities on COVID19. Thissupport requires a close engagement with communities and health volunteers. However, since the first COVID19 case was declared in Somalia, we have limited our community contact and tried to see possible options to provide Real-time support to our communities. This included using a mobile-based application, Well Beyond, to provide COVID19 prevention and containment training. This trail was found to be effective and efficient. We are now proposing the scale up the same approach to expand to include other training including hygiene promotions, WASHCO training, WASH <(>&<)> Protection related training.\nCOVID19 has changed our traditional ways of living, working and our regular ways of implementing programs. For ownership and sustainability, it is critical to ensure communities' involvement in program design and implementation. In COVID19 environment, this can only be possible by using technologies to deliver training, information and collect feedback.\nWe wish to deploy critically needed information into the Oxfam Somalia regions of work through the Well Beyond App. This life-saving mobile technology sends interactive COVID-19 and Sanitation and Hygiene training material tothe community based health voluneteers. The technology will fill knowledge gap between COVID-19 recommendations and the tools and knowledge available in the remote, rural places. It serve by providing vital training material, guidance on handwashing stations, surface hygiene, sanitation and real-time chat support, and other tools to help communities prevent the spread of COVID-19. At the sametime, Oxfam Somalia will be able to track training completions and collect data on the solution\u2019s success. This will allow the Oxfam field team to continuously interact with our beneficiaries and community health volunteers.\n\nThe UN Economic Commission for Africaprojected more than hundreds of thousands of Africans could lose their lives due to COVID-19. The Somali government, in alignment with the WHO, emphasizes that basic, preventative measures by individuals and communities remain the most powerful tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but delivering this critical information has been a challenge, as the movement within countries is very limited, and social distancing guidelines prohibit large group trainings in person. The Well Beyond App will allow us to provide this crucial guidance to our CHVs and support to our communities, even though we aren\u2019t physically able to be there.",

Accountability is \u201cthe process of using power responsibly, taking account of, and being held accountable by different stakeholders, and primarily those who are affected by the exercise of such power\u201d . It is the right to be heard, and the duty to respond.\n\nHowever, anecdotal information indicates that where CBFCMs initiatives and experiences exist in Oxfam, many are still disjointed, some are uncoordinated, and largely undocumented. In many places, they are non-existent, or if they are, not all of them are fully functional. The design of Oxfam\u2019s CBFCMs by Affiliates, Country Offices and in part Partners has not always ensured community involvement, in most cases resulting in not fit for purpose mechanisms. Also different affiliates still approach the issue of CBFCMs differently with different emphasis, approaches, tools and resources, therefore lacking a standardised coordinated approach.\n\nAlthough Oxfam prides itself for encouraging communities we work with to speak out and report PSEA and child protection concerns and incidents concerning them,recent reports in some countries like DRC, Ethiopia, and Uganda not only attests to the limited awareness at community level on SEAand child protection risks and reporting mechanisms, but has also led to an increase in attention to ensure that SEA and child abuse and exploitation by humanitarian and development organisations like Oxfam are addressed through investment in preventive approaches but also responding to reports of abuse and exploitation when these incidents are reported.\nOxfam has two responsibilities for accountability in the programmes it manages, holding a responsibility for mutual accountability with its partners (as do the partners) and also holding a shared or joint accountability (with its partners) to the communities affected by its programmes.

        "description": "The eastern regions in Somaliland and especially Saanag and Sool regions continue to suffer from recurrent drought. This situation has increased the vulnerability of the communities as they have lost most of their livestock which was their main source oflivelihood. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two regions also continue to experience occasional inter clan fighting which isoften triggered by competition for available pasture and water resources. Drilling of the a boreholes will not only contribute to providing important water sources that can support the water needs of the communities during drought and harsh climatic conditions, but also contribute to reducing risk factors leading to conflict. It will offer an opportunity to the benefiting communities to have a chance for better access to potable water, reduce the incidents water related diseases and increase access for water for practicing frequent handwashing to prevent COVID-19.\nObjectives;\n\u2022 Provide sustainable water source for 5000 people and over 10,000 livestockheads in Sanaag Region.\nGroundwater Feasibility Study:\nA groundwater feasibility study will be conducted in three selected villagesof Sanaag region. the study will follow three approach method,\n1. Remote Sensing: Desk review using latest satellite imageries to selected best possible locations. This phase will focus on finding regional fractures carrying water from highland of Ethiopia to thelowland of Sanaag regions and from Sanaag mountains to low land areas.\n2. Geophysical Study: ground truthing work will be conducting using latest start of art geophysical technology at least three locations with spacing of 1000 -1500m. This location are those selected in first phase of the study work. Government and community engagement will be conducted to understand the local geology, possible impact of drilling on environment and stability of the communities.\nDrilling of the borehole\nBased on the groundwater feasibility study, the drilling work will be advertised through the local media. In order to avoid failures resulted from improper use of drilling equipment and selection of drilling method, the contractor will receive full copy of the study report and will be given a briefing on the drilling technology and technique recommended by the study team. Then, a payment by result approach will be used to contract drilling companies i.e. Oxfam/Taakulo will only pay if the borehole has water with discharge of above 2liter per second. Failureto get a contractor willing to commence drilling with such conduction, further meeting will be help between Oxfam and Taakulo to discuss best possible approach to increase value for money.\nSupervision and Monitoring:\nIn drilling works supervision and monitoring progress is critical step. Oxfam/Taakulo will have a site supervisor equipped with necessary materials for supervision including TDS Sensor to record water quality at each 1 meter, mud funnel to record the drilling mud viscosity and deeper to follow the depth of the drilling. The supervisor will provide daily update to both Oxfam/Taakulo team and will ensure all decision that affect drilling performance is consulted and agreed before action. TDS level will be recorded in monitoring tool provided and the result will be used for deciding the borehole casing arrangement. All materials that will be used for drilling will be inspected by the drilling supervisor and approve. In case a specialized chemical will be used for the drilling; the supervisor will request for all safety related certificate prior use of such chemicals.\nPost Drilling Construction:\nThis action will be decided right after the drilling is completed. Provision of submersible pump with cable and riser pipes, and construction of generator house, water distribution system for both animal and human and storage facilities will be included under this phase. Other grants, including ECHO 2021 and/or other internal grants will be used to finance this critical activity. Incase the borehole salinity is above an acceptable regional level i.e. 2500ppm, provision of desalination unit will be considered.",

Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

Increase access to, utilisation and quality of health and nutrition services at community, primary and secondary health levels, especially for women, children and vulnerable populations and; 2. Strengthen the health system under the stewardship of the Somali Health Authorities (SHAs). The project\u2019s approach focuses on strengthening the SHAs\u2019 capacity at the regional, district and community levels to deliver the EPHS (core services 1-6). Lessons from Joint Health Nutrition Programme (JHNP) and other programmes, identified a critical management gap at the district level in Banadir. A core focus of the project\u2019s methodology is therefore to support the Regional health Officer (RHO) in Banadir to establish and develop a District Health Management Team (DHMT) in each of the 10-targeted districts. Having an operational management body at district level, within the SHA structure, will be an essential component of ensuring that the health facilities and community/female health workers (CHWs/FHWs), in their respective districts, are able to receive the technical, management and logistical support required for them to successfully deliver integrated, quality, health and nutrition services that the population can access. This is a structure and model that has been demonstrated to be successful in other health systems (e.g. in Kenya). The consortium will work closely with the RHO throughout the project to establish, develop and support the DHMTs.",

        "description": "This project aims at restoring stable communities in Somalia through establishing local structures that research, identify, analyse, prioritize and implement solutions to community security issues, in collaboration with local authorities, formal security actors and civil society. At the state level, it will re-establish bodies that promote community-responsive policing, acting as a link through which information on security provision is channelled, and form bridges between local, state and national levels. Learning and insights from all levels will be fed upwards through national-level civil society networks, promoting community-focused security provision at national and international level. The objectives of the programme are to strengthen the capacity of local civil society groups and communities to research and facilitate broad dialogue across clan and state-society divides about local security issues, provide resources for implementation of joint conflict prevention and community security initiatives, support cross-regional community exchange to share experiences and common security problems, link community members with existing dispute resolution mechanisms, support the re-introduction and development of regional oversight mechanisms such as police accountability committees with channels for community input, provide training on accountability, gender- and conflict-sensitivity, link these bodies into a cross-regional learning network, facilitate their engagement in policy dialogue at the federal member state level, conduct policy discourse with the Somali federal government, regional bodies and international actors to communicate evidence about inclusive approaches to improving human security, and facilitate dialogue among policy-makers at the national level and communities. This will eventually result in a reduction in inter and intra-clan division and violence, more inclusive, responsive and accountable security provision including effective mechanisms to prevent misuse of power and improve coordination, greater coherence in policy formation between Federal regions, and more evidence-based policy and programming on human security from international actors.",

        "description": "This Program Document proposes a Reengagement and Reform Development Policy Financing (DPF) for the Federal Republic of Somalia in the amount of US dollar 420 million from International Development Association (IDA) grant resources. The objectives of the proposed DPF are to facilitate full normalization of relations with the World Bank Group (WBG) and support Somalia's economic recovery through policy reforms that strengthen fiscal management and promote inclusive private sector-led growth. Up to SDR 271.2 (up to US dollar 375 million equivalent) of the proposed grant will be disbursed to the bridge-loan creditor assisting with arrears clearance (\u2018Portion A of the Financing\u2019); and SDR 32.6 million (US dollar 45 million equivalent) will be disbursed to the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) as budget support to meet cash flow needs after Somalia has cleared its arrears to IDA (\u2018Portion B of the Financing\u2019). The DPF complements a rapidly expanding engagement to build human capital and strengthen resilience to climate change and other shocks. In FY2020, the World Bank is currently delivering technical assistance to develop livestock insurance, a major Urbanization Review, and upstream analysis on health and education that are expected to inform new financing. The DPF also addresses the above challenges by enabling full reengagement with the WBG. The DPF will facilitate Somalia's clearance of arrears to IDA, which is a requirement to qualify for international debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Full reengagement with the international community through the HIPC process is expected to enable Somalia to access the financial and technical support the country needs for sustained poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. Normalization of Somalia's relationship with IDA would give the government's access to financing from IDA's Crisi",

While District Councils are mandated to provide services to citizens, there is still an unclear delineation of roles and responsibilities, as most sectors are (in practice) not yet decentralised from the line ministries and in many cases delivery been taken over by NGOs. Furthermore, there is a palpable mismatch between the responsibilities allocated to districts and the (financial and human) resources they have.\n\nThe Association of Local Government Authorities of Somaliland (ALGASL) was established in 2006 by the mayors of 10 district councils. ALGASL aims to build strong local governments and support decentralisation, benefiting local communities, including marginalized groups such as women, youth and IDPs. At present, ALGASL has 10 paying members out of the 23 districts with elected district councils. Though ALGASL has potential, the association is constrained by a lack of human and financial resources, which hinders its ability to fulfill its mandate and attract additional members.\n\nIf strengthened, ALGASL can play a pivotal role in working towards more legitimate local governments, because of its mandate to lobby and advocate for the interests of districts and to build their capacity. It is a highly relevant linchpin between central and local government, can provide nationwide outreach and can promote exchange of experience among districts through its platform function.",

It addresses knowledge gaps and generates evidence to help people cope with crises and meet their basic needs in the Horn of Africa, Sahel, and the Middle East. There are many drivers of crisis and poverty in this region. They include climate change, which has increasing impact on fragile, natural resource-based livelihoods. The target group for this programme are poor men and women, primarily in pastoralist areas of the Sahel and East Africa, who can benefit from improved agricultural support. SPARC\u2019s work is intended to inform FCDO\u2019s and other development agencies\u2019 programmes to strengthen the resilience of agricultural and pastoralist livelihoods, in the context of climate change. SPARC will: 1) Undertake new research that builds the evidence base where there are clear gaps on how to effectively deliver programmes and adapt policies. 2) Develop and support innovation, including through the use of technology, in FCDO and partner programmes, and in response to emerging agendas. 3) Targeted technical support to  country offices and programmes in the design, delivery and evaluation of existing programmes. 4) Develop and share lessons by curating knowledge, convening debates and undertaking broader communications and engagement initiatives to inform both the development of future policies and programmes, and technical support, ensuring that the research remains operationally relevant. 5) Research uptake and dissemination: to ensure that new analysis and tailored research is highly accessible to policy- and decision-makers, so that they can benefit from the programme\u2019s innovation and learning and apply it to their work. The programme will engage closely with FCDO country offices to ensure that FCDO country programmes and policies build on the evidence generated from the research.

Luglio 2019 ha segnato il livello pi\u00f9 basso di raccolti agricoli a partire dal 1995, il 70 sotto la media, con conseguenze umanitarie disastrose sulla popolazione. Le abbondanti piogge dell'ultimo mese hanno tuttavia provocato inondazioni nelle aree agricole, distruggendo sia gli insediamenti umani sia la produzione agricola Inoltre la mancanza di strutture igienico sanitarie di base ha causato il diffondersi del colera, della malaria e di altre malattie trasmissibili. Si stima che circa 5.4 milioni di Somali si trovino in condizione di insicurezza alimentare e necessitino di interventi urgenti per la sopravvivenza. L'intervento prevede attivit\u00e0 di emergenza anche volte al rafforzamento della resilienza con approccio DRR (Disasters Risk Reduction), di chi si trova in situazioni vulnerabili, aumentandone la capacit\u00e0 di fronteggiare futuri shock climatici, economici e sociali.",

Some 2.6 million people have been forced from their homes, with little or no access to basic services. Acute malnutrition rates remain near or above emergency thresholds, particularly among displaced populations. Violence due to terrorist threats and multiple conflicts has made access a challenge in many regions, hampering the ability of humanitarian workers to reach those in need.  With GAC\u2019s support, Action Against Hunger (ACF) is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of around 41,000 conflict-displaced people and host communities in the remote and hard to access Bakool region of Somalia. This project focuses on helping provide support to health facilities, treatment for acute malnutrition, rehabilitation of water and sanitation facilities, and cash to help meet basic needs. Project activities include: (1) training health workers on management of childhood illnesses; (2) providing of prenatal consultations to pregnant women and postnatal consultations to lactating women; (3) providing emergency water, sanitation and hygiene supplies to people in vulnerable communities, including internally-displaced people; and (4) constructing emergency latrines that meet the protective needs and privacy of women and girls.",

The project will seek to improve the retention of already enrolled children living in flood-affected areas into the quality and inclusive basic education in a safe and protective learning environment. \n\nThe project will target and support 8,750 children (40% girls) in 20 schools, the most affected schools will be selected in coordination with regional coordinators will receive light rehabilitation and furnishing of desks and chairs, provision of teaching and learning materials to 8,750 learners from 20 schools, provision of dignity kits to 2000 adolescent girls to enhance their daily school attendance, provision of recreational materials to 20 schools that are tailored to the needs of children, Provision of community-based psychosocial support in schools, the establishment of 20 temporary child-friendly spaces (CFS) that will support the provision of PSS, recreational activities and non-formal education activities. On the protection front, the project will identify specific protection needs, inform service provision and serve as an entry point for specialized service provision with boys and girls. Targeted psychosocial support, psychological first aid, case management, and emergency referrals will be provided to child survivors of rights violations, Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC), and children who show signs of trauma. 500 children will be targeted for IDTR and PSS provided, of which 30% expected to be reunified with their families. \n\nThe proposed intervention will create synergies with existing programs focusing on child protection. The caseworkers and monitors in the present proposal will act as a reference for the referral pathways aiming at connecting services in the communities. Before starting the implementation, HIWA will coordinate with Shelter, protection, WASH, and CCCM to ensure complementarity and reinforcement of the project approach. HIWA has a strong experience in child protection in emergency and in resilience context and has previously implemented child protection programs funded by UNICEF in Beletweyne and Buula Burte, through this experience HIWA has established linkages with community leaders, local authorities and camp leaders making access and acceptance easier in the target locations. HIWA will coordinate with the regional education cluster during the implementation of the project. Coordination with WASH cluster will be essential in implementing the project, HIWA will work closely with Wash partner who will carry out hygiene promotion in schools and also ensure the water sources in the schools are safe.\n\nOpportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration within and beyond the HIWA education and protection sectors will be sought. The collaboration will include emergency operations with cluster partners to ensure a comprehensive approach and view of education and child protection. HIWA will use the strength of its relationship with the regional education and protection clusters to share information and collaborate in service provision to avoid duplication of activities in the selected schools. Before implementation starts, HIWA will liaise with the regional coordination structure to identify schools that have not been targeted by other partners. HIWA will also closely work with Relief International and Qatar foundation on hygiene promotion and other WASH interventions. Referrals will be directed to them where WASH needs are identified in different schools.",

        "description": "-Free Press Unlimited will work on increasing the ethics and professionalism of Somali journalists so that they can act as a watchdog on behalf of civil society and inform, educate and entertain the public. -Free Press Unlimited will work with media houses to improve the quality of media content and strengthen their economic sustainability, making them independent players in society that are less prone to envelope journalism and biased reporting. -Free Press Unlimited will focus strongly on the improvement of the safety of journalists. -Free Press Unlimited will connect media, civil society organisations and (local) government actors to improve the enabling environment of the media, especially on better and more transparent regulation of the media in order to enhance editorial independence. -Free Press Unlimited will promote gender equity and equality across the whole program. -Free Press Unlimited will continue to build the capacity of individual journalists and partner radio stations to improve their program production capacity, improve ethical journalism and develop creative radio formats. Special focus will be on gender sensitive interactive program production that informs the audiences and increase their participation in the public debate. -Free Press Unlimited will contribute to the set up of an enabling environment and regulatory framework that ensures fair and free media by technical assistance to journalist associations. Free Press Unlimited will continue its work with the Somalia Media Support Group (SMSG) where it advocates for ethical journalism and press freedom on a more institutional and political level. FPU will also continue its anti-sharuur (envelope journalism) campaign to improve public trust in ethical journalism. -hanks to its large network of partner radios FPU can connect Civil Society Organsations with people living in remote areas that normally cannot be reached due to security reasons. The aim is to improve the ability of civil society actors to lobby for the needs of the population and advocate with authorities to develop laws and policies to Somalia\u2019s societal development. -FPU will build the capacity and support the safety of those working/participating in our program through holistic security training (of trainers). To this end Free Press Unlimited will share and develop the best available knowledge, lessons, curricula and (digital and physical) tool kits on safety, risk mitigation and emergency protection for media workers and reporters.",

Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden bereits Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt. Zur Finanzierung des Vorhabens stellt das BMZ insgesamt 23,24 Mio. EUR aus FZ-Altmitteln und einer neuen bilateralen Zusage bereit. Angesichts der gro\u00dfen Bedarfe in den drei Projektst\u00e4dten erfolgte dar\u00fcber hinaus eine Vorratspr\u00fcfung in H\u00f6he von 50 Mio. EUR.",

Das Projekt zielt darauf ab, einen Beitrag zur Verbesserung der Lebensbedingungen der Bev\u00f6lkerung und dort angesiedelter Binnenfl\u00fcchtlinge sowie zur\u00fcckkehrender Fl\u00fcchtlinge zu leisten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort. Das stimmt mit den Forderungen im Marshallplan mit Afrika \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" \u00fcberein. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo, Baidoa und Garowe wurden Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt.",

Damit wird ein Beitrag zur Verringerung der Jugendarbeitslosigkeit und zur lokalen Wirtschaftsentwicklung geleistet. Hierf\u00fcr werden schrittweise in Galkayo, Jowhar und Baidoa integrierte Gewerbeschulzentren aus- und neugebaut und ausgestattet. Das Konzept der integrierten Gewerbeschule zeichnet sich zum einen durch einen an klaren Qualit\u00e4ts- und Pr\u00fcfungskriterien ausgerichteten, praxisorientierten Unterricht aus. Zum anderen bieten die Gewerbeschulen verschiedene Dienstleistungen im Bereich Weiterbildung und Unternehmensf\u00f6rderung f\u00fcr die lokale Wirtschaft an. Das Vorhaben unterst\u00fctzt die Gewerbeschulzentren dabei, ein breites Dienstleistungsangebot zu entwickeln, dadurch Einnahmen zu generieren und sich mit einem nachhaltigen Finanzierungsmechanismus langfristig selbst unterhalten zu k\u00f6nnen. Durch die Verankerung in die lokalen Gemeinden und den Einbezug benachteiligter und vulnerabler Jugendliche verschiedener Clans sowie von Binnenvertriebenen sollen die Gewerbeschulen als friedensstiftende Begegnungsorte und Entwicklungspole der lokalen Wirtschaft wirken.",

        "description": "The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2019 and the 1st 2018 SHF Standard Allocation for the Food Security and Livelihood as it applies to project planned target District of Hobyo (South Mudug Region). The project will provide lifesaving support to 7,704 people assessed to be in acute food insecurity, \u2018Crisis\u2019 and \u2018Emergency\u2019 phases of IPC (3 and 4)  by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and safety net support.\n\nThe project proposes lifesaving interventions that are gender sensitive, adapt centrality of protection and that mainstream gender and protection in the delivery methods proposed. The project will specifically prioritize destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the two Districts) and other households as identified in the Hobyo Districts that fall into the IPC 3 and 4. The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the failure of the Deyr 2018 season rains in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project seeks to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food to 733 vulnerable households through Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) for 3 months with each household being entitled US $71 as per MEB for Mudug Region. The project will undertake a vulnerability assessment in selected locations of the targeted 4 locations in the District (2 settlements with IDPs and 2 settlements with high number of vulnerable host households) with the findings being used in developing the criteria for selection of the planned UCT beneficiaries and informing on protection needs.  Priority for the UCTs beneficiaries will be given to women-led households from the most vulnerable among recently displaced, non-displaced and socially marginalized communities in each of the respective target District. The UCTs planning will also be supported by a market analysis undertaken in the District (undertaken by the FSL Team) to determine the capacity of local markets to absorb the resources extended to the beneficiaries. \n\nIn addition the project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 451 unskilled laborers rehabilitating 3 Water Pans.  Each unskilled labourer of the planned 410 CfW laborers shall get $ 5 per day for 30 days and 41 skilled laborers at the rate of US 7. A total of 6,000 CUM water impounding capacity will be added to the current existing 1,080 CUM in the 3 targeted dams in Hobyo District. The project will also support the protection of the core breeding and milking herds normally under the care of women in the rural and urban settlements through supportive treatments. This will involve the creation of the requisite animal treatment capacity (currently missing) involving the provision of fixed value animal treatment vouchers.  A total of 1,000 animals in the district are targeted where each HH is estimated to be keeping 10 Shoats. A total of 100 HHs will be targeted in the District. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure that the project gets feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and arising gaps that will require humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below average rainfall for the coming Gu 2019 season as indicated by FEWSNET in its January 2019 update.\n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular helps make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project to ensure it provides the women safety and protection required.",

This intervention will seek to prioritize the provision of care and immunization for children lt5 years of age, pregnant and lactating women.  Diagnosis and treatment of common causes of morbidity, including diarrhea, ARI, malaria, and other targeted illnesses will take place according to IMCI guidelines. Monthly data to the respective District Health Management Information System (DHMIS) will be submitted as well as weekly surveillance data to WHO with MOH officials in copy to support the established CSR/Early Warning and Response Network (EWARNS) mechanism in Somalia. CARE will also train and support staff in completion of DHMIS reports during the MCH training and in subsequent monitoring to ensure accurate data collection. Outbreak investigation, rumor verification, timely response and control of communicable disease in conjunction with other stakeholders and clusters will be done.\n\n\nCare will support community health activities including the provision of individual and group counselling on positive heath practices supporting the provision of community links to basic health, nutrition, IYCF and WASH care and sensitization. To extend case management of childhood illness beyond health facilities, Community Health Workers (CHWs) will be trained on prevalent conditions such as management of fever, diarrhea and respiratory illnesses, and malaria. They will also refer all pregnant women to health facilities for care and encourage safe deliveries at facilities. The focus will be on early case identification and treatment, referral and compliance to treatment using the community\u2019s own mechanisms. CHWs will be trained on referral systems, and equipped with referral slips and a register to refer cases to the static MCHs. CHWs will be tasked with dissemination of pertinent health information, including preventive reproductive health and immunization activities, and in disease surveillance.\n\nReproductive health services will be provided and include the provision of equitable access to prenatal and postnatal health services provision of access to facility-based safe deliveries at static sites training of health staff on early detection, treatment and referral of pregnancy-related complications. CARE will establish referral pathways for CEMOC and complicated IMCI cases to three district hospitals currently supported by CARE (Lascanood, Erigavo and Badhan).  CARE will therefore support training for service providers focused on Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), psycho social support in coordination with GBV working groups in target areas.CARE will conduct training  for midwives and nurses in collaboration with CARE protection team, MOH and UNFPA on CMR. Targeted health workers will be sensitized about the health consequences of GBV and trained to identify and refer GBV survivors, while ensuring confidentiality and respect, response to survivors in a non-stigmatized way and provision of clinical care.  The health workers will also refer identified cases of rape to other services for survivors of sexual violence including safety planning, psychosocial support and other social and legal services.",

        "description": "The proposed project will be implemented in Bay region, in particular Baidoa district where HIDIG is implementing nutrition and health programmes. HIDIG will leverage of its ongoing WASH and nutrition activities to provide access to an integrated life-saving health services to an estimated 21,000 drought affected and urban poor host communities in Baidoa district through one static health facilities, and six mobile clinics, with a focus on maternal and child Health in partnership with the Ministries of Health and other healthcare service providers. The SHF funds will be used to support a critical response integrated with WASH and nutrition to respond to the health needs of malnourished children and women in Baidoa. The proposed response aims to respond to only areas with critical rates of malnutrition and measles and suspected AWD/Cholera hotspots where immediate provision of lifesaving emergency healthcare is intended to be carried out. For example, Bay region accounts for 48% of all measles cases in South Somalia which make up five regions. HIDIG implemented health project in Baidoa district in partnership with SHF in 2018, which has ended. To build on the gains achieved in 2018 and the ongoing routine immunization support from UNICEF, the proposed project will provide free emergency obstetric care including ANC, skilled delivery and PNC to 1,050 eligible women and improve referral system through provision of timely transportation. Overall, 21,000 direct beneficiaries, including 5,040 girls, 4,200 boys, 6,510 women, 5,250 men will benefit from the services. The organization will conduct routine and supplementary measles immunization targeted at children under-five in target areas. In addition, the capacity of 35 staff will be improved through training so that frontline staff in disaster events marked by a sudden or gradual increase in demand for healthcare services and a related decrease in the supply of resources available to provide such care can act. This will result in a community healthcare-sector response that can implement a variety of surge capacity strategies that include steps taken to reduce demand for care, e.g., the implementation of community-based triage capabilities and risk communication about when to seek care and the strengthening of referral care capacity in addition to better described inpatient care strategies. In this context, fifty community members will also obtain an increased knowledge and skills on community management of childhood illnesses. HIDIG is an active health cluster member in Bay, Bakol and Hiiraan regions and will actively share information with the cluster, UNOCHA and the Ministry of Health, both at state level and federal. The target district is accessible, and the organization has an active PCA with UNICEF in reducing maternal mortality rate through skilled deliveries and strengthening referral system in Somalia. These proposed interventions adhere to the SHf\u2019s life-saving criteria as they respond to time-critical requirements and contribute to reducing the loss of lives. Bay region has more than 12,000 people in IPC 4 and 176,000 in IPC 3, indicating the scale of the acute malnutrition in the region. Because of this, HIDIG requires support and additional resources are urgently required as health and nutrition facilities are seeing more people in need. HIDIG will coordinate its interventions with respective line ministries and other NGOs to ensure there is no duplication in the response and that critical gaps are covered",

Mental health service integrated into the primary health care services will be of a paramount importance, particularly in El-Bur district, a district that has been at the centre of armed conflict for the last ten years without receiving practically any health service for this entire period of time, let alone mental health service. The project will benefit 36,400 which include 16,761  women, 12,594 men, 3,617 boys and 3,411 girls that includes both vulnerable host communities and IDPs, who will benefit from services delivered by qualified and skilled health personnel. New ways will recruit a medical doctor with \u201cMental health\u201d training, who will be stationed in Guri-El. He will be dealing with referred patient from El-Bur and other patients from the region he will be also supporting people living HIV from our HIV program in Galgadud.",

According to FSNAU post deryr 2018  assessment report indicated that deterioration of  nutrition situation in Sool region with GAM rate (lt15%) due to high morbidity, low immunization ,Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. Additionally, extreme water and pasture shortages have led to an increased incidence of acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/ cholera outbreaks, which have already been reported in many villages in Sool region. According to rapid assessment conducted by KAALO in February 2019  showed, majority of the health facilities in the assessed villages lacked basic supplies and staff incentives as well as shortage of appropriate reproductive health kits, supplies and commodities. KAALO in partnership with SHF and UNICEF has been implementing an integrated health and WASH project at target location since 2015.The health facilities are facing extreme funding gaps, shortage of supplies and poor referral system. KAALO proposes to scale up its health interventions to save lives, mitigate emergencies, reduce mortality amp morbidity and fill gaps of health services for drought affected people through 2 fixed health facilities with two mobile clinics targeting 28,000 direct beneficiaries including (7000 WCBA, 5600 children under five) in Sool region. The  sexual and reproductive health SRH intervention consists in supporting the provision of basic and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services to all people at target districts and ensuring particularly the good health and well-being of mothers and newborns. This is done by supporting national health facilities in strengthening the health system strategy, equipping conflict-affected health facilities with emergency reproductive health kits, training health workers IMCI, BEmOC for reproductive health and deploying mobile teams in hard-to-reach areas to directly support the provision of services. Qualified nurses/ midwives will provide preventative and curative services, antenatal care, skilled delivery, postnatal care, treatment of common illnesses. The child health services include immunization of children under five years and promotion services including health education, growth monitoring, de-worming and supplementation with vitamin A. The mobile health teams will provide primary health Services for undeserved and hard to reach areas. They will also provide basic mental health and Psychosocial Support services and referral services. At the end of the project , a total of 28000 affected community (7000 women, 8400 girls, 8400 boys and 4200 men) improved and increased availability of health care including: promotive, preventative and curative services , reproductive health  and improved case management of childhood illnesses through two fixed health facilities with mobile outreach teams in Sool region.",

        "description": "The Nutrition and health situation remains fragile in Hobyo with children and women being most vulnerable. The key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional health system. Tied to that is minimal capacity available in the nutrition and health sector and  poor community literacy levels  (UNICEF 2018 WHO 2017). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease (UNICEF,2018, FSNAU,2018).\n Although there has been progress noted in service provision and policy development in Somalia including: roll out of national development plan with inclusion of a section on Nutrition and mainstreaming it to sectors (SNDP,2017), 2017-20 health sector strategic plan (FMoH,2017) and other health related policies, frameworks and guidelines,a lot still needs to be done to actualized these.\nIts important to note that disparities in health outcomes among Somali children and women still exist. These are based on: their exposure to violence and insecurity, access, gender and ethnic groupings, and the stability of communities/clan structure. Addressing these inequities, remains a priority (UNICEF,2018). This brings to light the fact that the situation in Hobyo  could be worse than national statistics considering that factors mentioned above fully exist here.\nServices in Hobyo barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure and harsh climate conditions. Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2018SAF UK,2018 SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2019). There are reports of drought and food shortages causing many to leave there homes in search of food and water. The is therefore need for urgent attention if the situation is to be controlled.\nGender issues that lock out significant others increasing negative social pressure on women not to adapt behaviors beneficial to health, should be addressed for positive nutrition outcomes to be realized. Finally capacity of service providers and locals communities to control malnutrition should be improved for quality service, resilient communities and sustainable projects.\nThe proposed interventions will link with  cluster objective one, two and four, and SHF 2019 1 standard allocation core elements  one,three, four, five and six, which cover provision of immediate life saving and time critical interventions, focus on communities affected by deteriorating nutrition of GAMgt15% , integration of services across sectors, protection mainstreaming and rapid response  enabling the most urgent scaling up of essential humanitarian activities,\nInterventions will also seek to provide primary ,secondary and tertiary prevention for acute malnutrition, build resilience to cushion against shocks in future and provide a platform to discuss and initiate durable solutions  in conjunction with other clusters and relevant bodies thus preventing shocks and ensuring protection.\nSAF UK has been implementing nutrition (OTP,TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) and health projects in north Hobyo for 2 years, but only covering  Afbarwaqo and surrounding villages, reporting huge impact \nThis proposed project seeks to scale up treatment of MAM beyond our current coverage through additional 3 fixed sites in health facilities and 4 mobile sites to access hard to reach areas. Additionally,the current  supplementary feeding project funded by WFP expires on 30th March 2019. We hope to sustain these services (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) ,avoiding gaps. \nOur proposal is  to provide supplementary feeding interventions (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP)  further integrating with health  project in all proposed sites for cost effective sustainable project",

        "description": ".The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Somaliland and Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Areas of particular concern include Northern Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed, and Galkacayo IDP which are experiencing emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. GAM rates of 10-14.9% are present in Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer. Similarly, the nutrition situation in Galkacayo IDPs is at a critical level and may deteriorate further without humanitarian assistance. According to the nutrition cluster nutrition burden estimate that was released in February 2019, in Galkayo IDPs, the nutrition situation was at a critical level with a GAM rate of 20.2% which is above the emergency threshold of GAMgt15%. Despite the high (estimated to be 61,092 by the health cluster) caseload of children with acute malnutrition in these regions, access to live saving nutrition services remains limited. In order to address these gaps, the proposed project will improve access and provide nutrition services to children aged 0 to 59 months and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) with acute malnutrition through detection and treatment in the targeted nutrition sites. Particular attention will be on the following activities: Training of Community Volunteers in the identification and referral of malnutrition cases to Save the Children   supported   nutrition centers, and mothers trained in mother-led MUAC to enlarge coverage with close monitoring from Save the Children to prevent wrong referrals and ensure quality of the screening and understanding of the community Provision of Outpatient Therapeutic Feeding (OTP) services for children aged 6-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) for Moderately Acute Malnourished children (MAM) and PLW through mobile outreach teams. Referring children aged 0-59 months identified with SAM coupled with medical complication, and SAM infants aged under 6 months with or without medical complications to the nearest stabilization center. The proposed nutrition project is mainly targeting Galkacayo IDPs (27), Awdal (30) and Woqooyi Galbeed (21) and Digaale and Jimaale HFs in Hargeisa IDPs locations, that are most affected by the current drought in Somalia. The project also promotes and supports optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding practices through the screening of breastfeeding difficulties amongst mothers of children under two years of age, provision of one to one counselling for mothers and caretakers with difficulties with regards to Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices and raising awareness of caregivers and relatives on the importance of appropriate IYCF. The project is targeting 59,971 direct beneficiaries, 27,830 will be from the IDPs while 32,141 beneficiaries will be from the Host Communities. In addition, a total of  96,904 beneficiaries will be reached with key IYCF messages in the targeted areas. The proposed project will incorporate learnings from previous projects on how women and girls can participate meaningfully in nutrition interventions.One of the learnings is that mothers in the IDP settlements a lead role in championing for IYCF interventions once they receive sufficient training, this is because they gained a deeper understanding of the importance of breastmilk to children and were willing to breastfeed exclusively if they had a source of livelihood.Another learning is that women can be powerful agents of change when it comes to hygiene promotion once they understand the benefits of good hygiene practices and this has a positive impact on the whole community particularly as women tend to be the sole custodians of household and child rearing chores.",

The accumulated figure reflect 90% of the total burden of the target districts based on 2019 nutrition cluster burden estimates as well as the projected figures for the first half of the year 2020. \n\nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somali Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project.\n\nThe project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the nearest stabilization centers using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will manage 22 fixed OTP sites and 2 stabilization centres (6 OTP fixed sites for Zeila district 9 fixed OTP sites and 1 SC for Berbera district, 6 fixed OTP sites for Hargeisa district 1 fixed OTP and 1 SC for Gabiley district). Efforts will be made to ensure integration of OTP and TSFP sites where possible.  In order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCH facilities. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \n\nIn addition, the project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. In order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children.

        "description": "Some 1.5 billion people, half of the world\u2019s poor, live in fragile settings where the government is unable or unwilling to fulfill its core responsibilities to protect and care for its citizens. In such fragile settings, often characterized by variable levels of violent conflict, perspectives for stability and sustainable inclusive development - key priorities of the Dutch Government - continue to be extremely bleak. Whereas each fragile setting is unique, a broad international consensus exists on the multiple and complex causes that need to be addressed for a transition out of fragility. Among these, establishing inclusive governance processes is considered essential. A key obstacle for achieving stability and sustainable development in fragile settings is the structural exclusion of segments of society from local, district level and national governance processes. Our theory of change (TOC) addresses this with a focus on inclusive governance processes, referring to the extent to which governance processes provide space to overcome the systematic exclusion of disadvantaged groups seeking to participate in decision making. Therefore this strategic partnership\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to inclusive and effective governance processes in fragile settings. Specific target and impact groups may vary country by country and will be determined on the basis of thorough analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of women in governance processes is key to stability and development in all countries and therefore crosscuts all program interventions.",

The layers of conflict are incredibly localized\nwith specific grievances tailored to each community, unpacking these grievances\nis an integral part of the transition, recovery and development needs of\nSomalia. The road to peace and development remains a long-term process, with\nsome regions being ahead of others. Currently, the most at-risk regions\ncorrelate with those that have remained marginal to development and\nhumanitarian interventions, including, inter\nalia, Middle and Lower Shabelle; Middle Juba, Galkayo District in Galmadug\nstate and parts of Bakool region. Longstanding clan grievances coupled with\nland and resource scarcity and political representation have led to al Shabaab\nexploiting the existing tensions making these regions fertile ground for\nconflict and displacement. \n\nThe\nproposed Action will primarily target the main urban centers where the\ndisplacement crises has been contributed to deepen the urban crises. Cities and\ntowns like Johwar and Beletweyne but also Dhusamareeb have a tremendous\ninfrastructure backlog. The floods in 2018 along the Shabelle River have caused\nadditional damage to urban infrastructure (see also Humanitarian Needs and\nResponse Plan 2019).\n\nThe\nprogramme will be aligned with and built on existing government priorities,\nplanning frameworks and strategies for both catalysing stability gains in the\ncountry, restoring state authority in recovered areas and finding lasting\nsolutions to displacement. These include, but are not limited to the Wadajir\nFramework for Local Governance, Peace and Reconciliation; The Comprehensive\nApproach to Security (strands 3 and 4), the National Development Plan, Chapter\n8 on Resilience and the national Durable Solutions Initiative (DSI; 2016); the\nNational Transition Plan[1];\nand impending Reconciliation Framework. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] The National Transition\nPlan is an ongoing discussion between AMISOM, the Federal Government of Somalia\nand international partners and focuses on the drawdown of AMISOM, to be\nreplaced by national security institutions and is based on the achievement of a\nset of security milestones and conditions.",

        "description": "After decades of insecurity and political instability, Somalia currently stands at a critical juncture for stabilization, peacebuilding and development. The prolonged conflict, in conjunction with the slow rise of political and state legitimacy, leaves the country with almost no functioning institutions and or rule of law. In 2012, the reestablishment of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), marked progress towards more permanent governance structure.Despite the considerable progress made in the last few years, the country still faces many challenges regarding political stability, peace and economic progress. One of those key challenges relates to land issues and how to address them in a systemic way in order to contribute to overall peacebuilding efforts.Land becomes intertwined with conflicts in various ways, primarily when dispossession takes place, or when rights to ownership, land use, access and transferability are consistently and arbitrarily violated. Any disruptive or forcefully imposed change on how groups and individuals connect to their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia has - resulted in various forms of organized violence and community disruption. Clan dynamics have also been a contributing factor to land conflict when there has been competition for the control of resources . With little to no effective state control of land or its administration, management and governance; armed groups and individuals can illegally acquire land, dispossess people, and forcibly evict the most vulnerable without due process. Those with access to social, economic and political power, coupled with the ability to use violence, have been able to illegally gain titles or control over land. The insecurity of tenure is also a significant barrier to the integration and economic development of displaced persons and communities. With the constant threat of forced evictions, displaced and vulnerable groups do not invest in the land, which impacts their ability to seek a livelihood.Political and socio-economic elites, and terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab, and the public at large including displaced populations are all current actors when it comes to land issues in Somalia. The State, due to political stagnation, insecurity and lack of institutional capacity has not been able to assert control over land management and governance or produce adequate land policies and legislation. An important role for the State will be to reclaim all public property and develop a cohesive land system that can produce policy or regulatory frameworks that govern land and land use in accordance with the rule of law. Elite groups with access to militia and financial resources are another actor whose unregulated actions disproportionately impact land markets and fuel land disputes and conflicts.Al-Shabaab remains a significant threat to the state and communities in many parts of the country and in most of the regions proposed for this programme. Different sources also assert that because of lack of trust in the formal justice system which is perceived as corrupt and clan based, people will prefer to go to Al-Shabaab courts to ensure protection of their land rights rather than to the formal court system. The public, including both host communities and displaced persons, is also another actor and the end-users this programme seeks to reach. Most often, the weakest and most vulnerable groups, they often face legal uncertainty, lack of protection and consistence violations to their housing, land and property rights.Another contributing factor to the land conflict dynamic in Somalia, which has only become more pronounced in recent years is migration and displacement. Due to years of conflict and natural disasters, millions of Somalis have been displaced and dispossessed of their land. Recent trends of returning refugees from neighboring countries and those who have been in a state of protracted displacement has resulted in large communities of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vulnerable groups living in informal settlements with little to no access to tenure security. Because of the current trends, it is predicted that this dynamic will continue, and programs must account for the reality that not only will rapid urbanization rates require urban resilience measures, but also promoting social cohesion is vital to peacebuilding initiatives. Protective measures for vulnerable groups through safeguarding basic human rights and enhancing security of tenure is not only important for land tenure purposes, but it also facilitates reintegration and economic development that can help stabilize and develop the region.Land disputes and conflict have disproportionate impacts on different groups within society. Women and youth are amongst the most disenfranchised when it comes to equal access to land use and ownership. With little formal recognition of rights to land and a male dominated customary land adjudication process, the rights of women are often periphery in land discussions. Ownership of land for Somali women is often linked to male relatives for greater protection. Such a reliance however limits their agency and poses a significant disadvantage to women-headed households. This programme will work towards enhancing women\u2019s access to justice as end-users and encouraging their participation in land governance and adjudication systems.Youth make up much of the Somali population, approximately 81.5% of the population is under the age of 35 . Despite the high number, this does not translate into proportionate political or social representation. They face numerous systemic barriers and require targeted advocacy to ensure that their rights are enforced. This project will benefit from, and work collaboratively with the PBF-funded Youth Political Empowerment project currently being implemented in Jubbaland and South West State. This program will aim to incorporate and integrate youth and their experiences, it will encourage their participation and ensure protection mechanisms are in place for them. Other vulnerable groups, including clan minorities are also marginalized when it comes to land access and rights. Using a human right centered approach to land management and supporting governments to standardize and promote land rights is key to a fair and equitable land reform process. By encouraging the participation of women and youth in land dispute resolution mechanisms we can begin to appropriately reflect the diversity of the communities in judicial and quasi-judicial processes.This project intersects on each of the five strategic priority areas from the UN Strategic Framework, and will directly support the realization of three of them:1. Supporting institutions to improve Peace, Security, Justice, the Rule of Law and Safety of Somalis 2. Strengthening accountability and supporting institutions that protect3. Strengthening resilience of Somali institutions, society and population8By enabling governments to address land conflicts in a meaningful way, this project will establish land dispute resolution mechanisms to enhance access to justice, improve security and contribute to overall peace and adherence to rule of law. To ensure full national ownership this project hopes to create enabling dynamics that allow national, state and local governments to take the lead and institutionalize these efforts. This project will not only contribute to the UN\u2019s strategic priorities, but also supports and aligns with several of the pillars of the Somali National Development Plan9 and the priority areas for each region. By working to improve land governance at local and national levels, this project contributes to enhancing Rule of Law, building effective and efficient institutions, supporting economic growth and safeguarding gender and human rights. Supporting customary and formal legal mechanisms that can address land disputes will work towards re-establishing the rule of law. A focus on land governance and management will also help build effective and efficient institutions that are better able to serve the public needs.The project is aiming at capacitating approximately 500 direct beneficiaries (local authorities and community members) to information management system to register land, as well as approximately a total of 200,000 indirect beneficiaries (50,000 per target location) benefiting from improved justice mechanism and land information management systems.",

        "description": "The proposed project studies war induced rapid urbanization processes in Somalia from the viewpoint of the most vulnerable in-migrants, people who were internally displaced (IDPs) in the cause of the on-going war. It investigates security perceptions and practices of IDPs in four cities of Somalia (including Puntland) and Somaliland and thereby focus on the capacities that vulnerable populations develop to cope with the effects of violence and displacement and to mitigate their vulnerability. Grounded in the everyday (Lefebvre, 1971 2016, De Certeau, 1984; Felski, 1999) and bridging urban and security studies, the project foregrounds people's own understandings of security, which risks and threats they identify, however narrow or broadly defined, and how these risks impede on their daily life (Crawford   Hutchinson 2015). In particular, the research asks: What does security mean and on which security arrangements do urban IDPs rely in the everyday? How do social, political, economic and environmental factors shape dynamics of everyday security? What continuities and change characterize security arrangements and everyday security in the course of migration to the city? With photo-voice, the project additionally proposes a methodology that gives 'voice' to people who are usually overheard or silenced, without however relying solely on their verbal capacities.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve access to safe and affordable water and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable households in urban and peri-urban areas of Hargeisa city, through expanded supply of drinking water from sustainable water sources, and associated creation of employment opportunities.\nThe project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). \nThe specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: \ni. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; \nii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and \niii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.\nThe overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. \nAs requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. \nWhile the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:\nii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield\niii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. \niv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)\n\n\n\n\n[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project \u201cRehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System\u201d (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)",

        "title": "Development And Pilot Implementation Of An Environmental Management System (Ems) At Un Support Office In Somalia (Unsos)",
        "description": "UNSOS is committed to reduce the environmental footprint of the mission\nin its host country, Somalia. It wants to improve the environmental performance\nof the mission by introducing sustainable design and operation (as much as the\nsituation in Somalia permits). This means addressing solid waste, wastewater,\nuse of energy and resource management as whole. UNSOS wants to achieve this by\nintroducing a systematic Environmental Management System (EMS) to each sector\nof the mission, which can be approved by an international organization of\nstandards (ISO) in the long-term. \n\n\n\nCurrently, UNSOS has a mission specific Environmental Policy (pending\napproval) that was drafted in reference to DPKO/DFS\nEnvironmental Policy for UN Field Missions, established in June 2009. The\npolicy defines environmental standards and objectives for UN field missions as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\u201cEach United\nNations field mission will take actions to integrate environmental measures\ninto its planning and operations in order to avoid and minimize the impact of\nactivities carried out by the mission and its staff on the environment and to\nprotect human health from such environmental impact. ?Such measures will be undertaken throughout all phases of a United\nNations field mission, including: Initial planning of the mission; setting up of logistic arrangements for the mission; maintenance and\noperations of the mission; closing of the mission.\u201d ?\n\n\n\nAn environmental policy (by itself) does not bring about a change in\npractices. Only the EMS is a guarantee that the Environmental Policy is\nactually implemented and that applicable standards are consistently met by the\norganisation during its operation. Only through the operationalization of a\npolicy will it be possible to minimise the environmental footprint of sector\nhubs and associated operations. Hence, the EMS means the operationalization of the environmental policy in place\nand to achieve set objectives and targets.\n\nThe Secretary General (SG) in his letter to the president of the Security Council dated 7 October\n2015 (S/2015/762 on the review of AMISOM and UNSOA) underlined that: \n\n\n\n\u201cThe impact on the environment of the United\nNations-supported activities in Somalia also remains a concern. The review\nnoted the absence of an environmental baseline study, dedicated environmental\nmanagement capacities and an African Union environmental policy to guide AMISOM\noperations, particularly with regard to wastewater management.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe strengthening of UNSOA and its conversion into UNSOS also includes\nthe development of capacities for adequate environmental management. \n\n\n\nThe Board of Auditors in its 2015 review of the operation of UNSOA formulated the following\nrecommendations: \n\n\n\nUNSOS is to develop a plan for undertaking and updating periodically\nenvironmental baseline studies of all Mission's locations in order to comply\nwith DPKO/DFS Policy on Environment for UN Field Missions.\n\nUNSOS is (a) develop a guideline of maintaining records of waste produce\nin the Mission; and (b) develop a database of waste produced in the Mission and\nupdate it accordingly. \n\nUNSOS is to develop effective mechanism such as action plan and effective\nmonitoring system for ensuring the Mission comply with the environmental policy\nrequirements.\n\n\n\nThe subsequent Security Council\nResolution (S/2015/840) stated the following:\n\n\n\n\u201cFurther requests the Secretary-General to consider the environmental impact\nof the UN fulfilling its mandated tasks, including carrying out an\nenvironmental baseline study and regular environmental impact assessments of\nthe operations of UNSOM and UNSOS.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll of the above mentioned elements point towards the fact that missions\nneed to take practical measures to obtain tangible results in order to meet the\nguidelines set forth in the DPKO/DFS Policy.",

        "description": "UN-Habitat\nhas worked with the issue of public space for 15 years or more. However, at the\n23rd Governing Council of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States\nasked UN-Habitat to place a larger focus on public space and how it can\ncontribute to sustainable urban development (Resolution 23/4 on Sustainable\nUrban Development through Access to Public Spaces). Specifically, UN-Habitat is\nmandated:\n\nTo advance the agenda on place-making and\n     public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and international\n     approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\n     UN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces\n     and the quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange,\n     cooperation and research between partners working in this fieldTo develop a policy approach on the role\n     that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of our rapidly urbanizing\n     world, to disseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a\n     plan for ensuring its application internationally;To assist in coordinating UN-Habitat partners in\ndisseminating knowledge to existing sustainable urban development processes at\nall government levels.Globally,\nthe growing attention to\npublic space informed the 23rd Session of the Governing Council of\nThe United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in 2011, where\nmember states mandated UN-Habitat to consolidate agency-wide work on public\nspace, to develop and promote public space policy, coordination, disseminate\nknowledge and directly assist cities in public space initiatives.[1]\n\n\nAgainst this\nbackdrop, UN-Habitat established in 2012, a Global Programme on Public Space\nnow working in 30 cities. The world secretariat of the United Cities and Local\nGovernments (UCLG) has created a Strategic Planning Committee chaired by the\ncities of Porto Alegre and Durban with a strategic focus on global advocacy,\nestablishing regional networks of cities working on public space, supporting\nlearning exchanges, tool development and documenting good practices in\npartnership with UN-Habitat. The Italian Institute of Urbanism (INU) has been\ninstrumental in developing the Charter on Public Space as well as hosting the\npublic space biennale.\n\nAnother great\nmilestone which has been achieved is the adoption of the 2016-2030 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals which adopted a Goal 11 \u2018Build cities and human settlements\ninclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\u2019 One of the proposed targets set\nout is \u201cby 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible,\ngreen and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and\npersons with disabilities\u201d.\n\nThe adoption of\nthe SDG 11.7 by the General Assembly in September 2015, constituted the most\nsignificant attention ever to public space in the global policy arena. However, continued support for SDG 11,\nand in particular public space Target 11.7, will be even more important to\nensure adequate means of implementation and a sound monitoring framework that\nwill be necessary to catalyse action on public space as a contribution to\nsustainable cities and human settlements. This will require that cities invest\nin public space and in the spirit of the new urban agenda cities and local\ngovernments should take an integrated, trans-disciplinary approach by working\nin partnership with a range of stakeholders and organizations, including civil\nsociety, academia and the private sector to ensure inclusive, safe and\naccessible public spaces for all.\n\nIn 2013-15, the Future of\nPlaces (FoP) initiative significantly contributed to raising awareness around\nthe public space agenda on a global level. The FoP is a multi-stakeholder\ninitiative which was established by Ax:son Johnson Foundation, UN-Habitat and\nProject for Public Spaces (PPS) bringing together a large and diverse network\nof stakeholders around the issues of public space through a series of annual\nconferences (2013 in Stockholm, 2014 in Buenos Aires and 2015 in Stockholm\nagain). The Future of Places gathered leading global thinkers, academia,\ndecision-makers, practitioners, other UN Agencies, media, communities and\nprivate sector that subscribe to the transformative power that good quality\npublic spaces can have in a city. All together the network represents about\n1,500 individuals from 700 organisations, from 275 cities, across 100 countries. The success of this initiative has shown the\ncommitment of a wide range of actors with a stake in public space, as well as\nhighlighted the global importance of this theme. In a short time it has created\na global movement for public space (10.000 followers on twitter) contributing\nactively to highlighting its benefits and putting it on the global development\nagenda.UN-Habitat has worked in\nthe area of public space for over 15 years. However, at the 23rd Governing\nCouncil of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States asked UN-Habitat to\nplace a larger focus on public space and how it can contribute to sustainable\nurban development. Specifically, UN-Habitat is mandated: \n\n\n\na) To advance the agenda on\nplace-making and public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and\ninternational approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\nUN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces and\nthe quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange, cooperation\nand research between partners working in this field; \n\n\n\nb) To develop a policy\napproach on the role that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of\nour rapidly urbanizing world, to\ndisseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a plan for\nensuring its application internationally;\n\nc) To assist in coordinating\nUN-Habitat partners in disseminating knowledge to existing sustainable\nurban development processes at all\ngovernment levels.\n\nThe project is\nalso aligned with the UN-Habitat Strategic Plan 2014-2019 and specifically to Sub-programme\n2: urban planning and design and expected\naccomplishment 2: integrated and\nparticipatory urban plans and public space for compact, inclusive and\nconnected cities.\n\nFor example, the project links with the\nfollowing UN-Habitat interventions:\n\n\u00b7\nUrban\nBasic Services: Sustainable Urban Transport in East African Cities (SUSTRAN)\nProgramme\n\n\u00b7\nParticipatory\nSlum Upgrading Programme (PSUP) \n\n\u00b7\nMunicipal\nSpatial Support Programme (MuSPP)\n\n\u00b7\nThe\nSafer Cities Programme\n\nUN\nHabitat is also a knowledge leader in the public space arena, developing tools\nand guidelines as well as contributing to global thinking through the Habitat\nIII issue papers, policy units, amongst others. Moreover, UN-Habitat has commenced several partnerships on the global\nbut also on the regional level focusing on issues related to public space. Therefore, UN-Habitat is perfectly\nplaced to take advantage of the opportunities presented by SDG11.7 on public\nspace and continue working on public space for the next four years.",

        "title": "Achieving Local Solutions To Displacement Crises In Somalia: A Human Security Approach To Durable Solutions",
        "description": "Human\nmobility should be considered in conjunction with the spatial repercussions\nthat population movements have on the locations affected by displacement. Over\nthe course of more than two decades of conflict, access to land, security of\ntenure and more broadly settlement\nhave become central issues affecting Somalia\u2019s security and stability going\nforwards; influencing the country\u2019s trajectory towards recovery and development\nin future; and ultimately playing a key role in establishing the foundations\nfor human security for displaced populations, returnees, other mobile groups\nand their hosts. \n\n\n\nIssues\nrelated to land tenure in Somalia are inextricably linked to voluntary and\nforced migration. Land is central to many different economic, social, cultural,\nenvironmental and political goals, making tenure security vital for peace and\nstability. Yet, land becomes a conflict driver when forms of dispossession take\nplace, or when rights to land use, access and transferability are violated. Any\ndisruptive or forcefully imposed change in how groups and individuals connect\nwith their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia did -\nresult in forms of organised violence. Conflict, natural disasters or rapid\nsocial and economic transformations (e.g. state formation, industrialization\nand urbanisation) trigger migrations that separate populations from their\nbelongings, assets, livelihoods and the cultural landmarks they identify with.\nHaving in place fair mechanisms to protect formal and customary rights to\naccess, use and transferability of land and regulate land use and allocation is\nessential to prevent outbreaks of conflict and violence.\n\n\n\nRegarding movements\nand dispossessions produced by conflict and natural disasters, in Somalia the\nnumber of internally displaced has almost tripled over the past ten years. The\nurban dimension of internal displacement is evident and corroborated by the\ntrends in rural to urban migration which has, over the past ten years, averaged\nrates of 4.1-4.5%. The relevance of cities in strengthening security,\nresponding to large population influxes and consolidating peace dividends is\nunquestionable. Yet, city expansion in major urban centres in Somalia is\nlargely unplanned and unregulated and land is arbitrarily redistributed.\nIncreased commercial interests have triggered large-scale investments, as well\nas construction works for commercial and residential structures. However, the\ntrickle-down effect of this renewed commercial interest is extremely limited.\nVulnerable populations hardly ever are in the position to harness the benefits\nof this rapid transformation. Displaced persons, returnees urban dwellers and\nurban poor are caught in a negative feedback loop, whereby the lack of\nregulation, good governance and law enforcement, exacerbates insecure access to\nland, exposure to violent land disputes and forcible eviction, as well as\nexclusion from public service delivery. This vulnerability and marginalization\ncontributes to pervasive fragility and conflict, In sum, nascent formal\ninstitutions are unequipped to equitably re-establish tenure units, and\ncustomary rights are often arbitrary and not accessible to \u201cidentity-defined\u201d\nstrangers - this would be the case of returnees and migrants who cannot access,\ncontrol and transfer land customary rights on the same grounds as local\ncommunities.\n\n\n\nThe recent\nannouncement by the government of Kenya expressing intention to repatriate\nSomali refugees has raised the already prominent issue to a critical level in\nsome areas. In the absence of a well-established legislative framework and law\nenforcement procedures for land, context appropriate, consensus based, and\nequitable solutions to land remain key establishing foundations for sustainable\nrecovery and stability. Conversely, the failure to address land issues,\nsecurity of tenure and sustainable housing could result in instability,\nconflict and the destitution of affected groups. \n\n\n\nThe multidimensional\naspect of community driven responses to instability and conflict mitigation\nrelated to mobility and housing, land and property as well as urban planning\nrequires a multi-agency approach, through which each agency will capitalize on\nits own experience and expertise. The International Organization for Migration\n(IOM) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) have the\nexpertise and mandates to support these locally owned processes in addressing\nmobility/displacement and space/urban planning. IOM, as the leading agency on\nmobility and migration, will utilize its experience in supporting community\ndriven approaches to respond to drivers of displacement and mitigate disputes\nrelated to mobility and movements, while UN-HABITAT, as the leading agency for\nurban planning and addressing issues related to space, including land, will\nemploy its expertise in supporting locally driven approaches to promote\nparticipatory urban planning, participatory settlement upgrading, resolve land disputes and map conflicts and\ndispute resolution mechanisms related to housing, land and property.\n\n\n\nGiven the scale of\nSomalia\u2019s population movements summarized above, geographic targeting through a\nfirst phase of support needs to be carefully considered and the following\ncriteria are used to prioritize targeting for this project. Firstly, areas\nimpacted by the return of Somalis from Dadaab refugee camp are prioritized for\nthis intervention. Whilst the number of IDPs by far exceeds the number of those\nreturning from Dadaab, the former are living in protracted situations of\ndisplacement and the latter will return over a short space of time. This\njustification is therefore based on the time critical impact that returns will\nhave in existing fragile contexts and the accompanying need to provide support\nat social, infrastructural and legislative levels. The second criterion is to\ntarget those areas highly impacted by internal displacement particularly those\nnot currently covered by existing interventions. When combined with the first\ntargeting, of areas being impacted by return, the following areas become an\nobvious priority. \n\n\n\n\n \n  \n  Location\n  \n  \n  Estimated IDP population\n  \n  \n  Estimated No. of returns based on intention\n  surveys[1]\n  \n  \n  Returnees from Dadaab to date\n  \n \n \n  \n  Kismayo\n  \n  \n  57,240[2] \n  \n  \n  39,723\n  \n  \n  4,873\n  \n \n \n  \n  Afmadow\n  \n  \n  54,984[3]\n  \n  \n  \n  2,085\n  \n  \n  1,347\n  \n \n \n  \n  Garbaharey\n  \n  \n  3,325\n  \n  \n  58\n  \n  \n  133\n  \n \n \n  \n  Baardheere\n  \n  \n  18,000\n  \n  \n  1,600\n  \n  \n  2,005\n  \n \n \n  \n  Bu\u2019ale\n  \n  \n  12,000\n  \n  \n  3,966\n  \n  \n  1,536\n  \n \n \n  \n  Sakow\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  2,181\n  \n  \n  2,004\n  \n \n \n  \n  Jamame\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  193\n  \n  \n  764\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nFor the funding from\nthe Human Security Trust Fund, the interventions will focus on Kismayo and\nAfmadow, while additional co-funding from other sources (Peacebuilding Fund,\netc.) will focus on other locations within Jubaland. Members of the joint\nprogramme currently have either an existing operational footprint or will\nexpand to these locations in the coming months which also supports the\nfeasibility of supporting interventions there.\nFurthermore, all of the above referenced locations have been identified as\npriority by the Federal Government Ministry of Interior and are therefore in\nline with government\u2019s current focus for the types of interventions proposed.",

As well as threatening species with extinction, IWT destroys vital ecosystems. IWT also fosters corruption, feeds insecurity, and undermines good governance and the rule of law. The UK government is committed to tackling illegal trade of wildlife products. Defra manages the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, which is a competitive grants scheme with the objective of tackling illegal wildlife trade and, in doing so, contributing to sustainable development in developing countries. Projects funded under the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund address one, or more, of the following themes: \u2022 Developing sustainable livelihoods to benefit people directly affected by IWT \u2022 Strengthening law enforcement \u2022 Ensuring effective legal frameworks \u2022 Reducing demand for IWT products Over \u00a323 million has been committed to 75 projects since the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund was established in 2013; five projects were awarded in 2014 (via applications to the Darwin Initiative), fourteen in 2015, fifteen in 2016, thirteen in 2017, fourteen in 2018 and in the latest round in 2019.

        "title": "Sustainable Access to clean Water,Hygiene and Sanitation to droughts affected communities in Sanaag and Sool region",
        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Northern Somalia in 2018 remains fragile due to residual impact of drought, Cyclone Sagar, conflict and ongoing displacement. While the risk of famine has reduced, humanitarian needs remain high, with extreme water and pasture shortages reported in rainfall deficit areas of Bari, Nugaal, Sool and Sanaag regions. Water scarcity in Sool and Sanaag regions has reached a precarious level, affecting the health of the most vulnerable people and causing occasional resource-based clan conflicts. With only a third of the population having access to improved sanitation, poor hygiene practices (including frequent open defecation) are prevalent, contributing to incidences of water-borne diseases. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve WASH service delivery at district level. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness. \n\nACTED will implement these activities in Taleex district of Sool region, and Erigavo and Dararweyne districts of Sanaag region, targeting a highly vulnerable and largely undeserved area. Approximately 15,000 people (2,500 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, or escalation of conflict, which may cause communities to flee to other areas.",

The pentavalent vaccine, administered in a three-dose schedule, offers protection against five diseases: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), heptatitis B and Haemophilius influenzae type b. Until 2013, GAVI has helped to introduce the pentavalent in 70 of the 73 GAVI-eligible countries, with the aim of reaching all 73 by the end of 2014.

It builds on ongoing work to promote employment, decent work and income opportunities in Somalia. The project strategy draws on the findings of the review of the DWCP of Somalia (2014-2016), which among other issues, has pointed to the need for tailored capacity development interventions to enable workers and employers organizations to deliver services to their members and effectively engage in social dialogue. The project interventions will focus on: (i) addressing the youth employment challenges; (ii) creating a strong connection between humanitarian and development support; (iii) building on employment-intensive investment strategies; and (iv) integrating direct employment creation and skills and enterprise development for increased employability. The project is expected to provide opportunities for the ILO to leverage resources, expertise and synergies at the country level, notably through cooperation and collaboration within the UN system as well as with development partners. This project contributes to the country\u2019s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG targets 1.5 (Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters) and 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services).",

The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

Successful implementation of these interventions will result in reduction in harmful practices, increased value of women and girls and will contribute towards greater voice, choice and control for Somali women and girls over their bodies and futures (Project Impact). This will be achieved transforming social norms to support gender equality in Somalia (Outcome) through three key outcome areas: 1) Enhanced legal and policy environment for greater equality of women and girls; 2) Improved knowledge and attitudes of men, women, girls and boys on gender discriminatory social norms; and 3) Increased social and economic empowerment of women and girls.

        "description": "This Joint FGS-UN Programme aims to capitalise on recent security, governance and reconciliation achievements by expanding employment opportunities for young men and women, mainly in newly recovered areas. The programme recognizes the centrality of youth in fostering stability in the country and outlines specific interventions that can be taken within the next 24 months to begin to generate decent work opportunities for young people that will serve as positive alternatives to participation in violence and conflict. This will also contribute to the revitalization of the local economy. The programme will tackle youth at risk, unemployed and underemployed youth. The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months. The programme will initially be tailored for the first 24 months as per the Compact deadline (see also Table 1): \u2022 1: Improved long-term potential for growth, productivity and employment of at least three value chains in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector. \u2022 2: Equip 10,000 youth with basic literacy, numeracy and life-skills and sector-specific vocational and business training to enhance their employability to access sustainable job opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential. \u2022 3: Create 30,000 short-term jobs created through cash-for-work projects to rehabilitate productive infrastructure in target locations, mainly in newly recovered areas.",

        "description": "The proposed 12-month intervention will improve access to quality education, increase access to critical WASH inputs and enhance child protection mechanisms in 16 schools for conflict-affected IDP\u2019s and host community learners in Galgaduud regions of Galmudug State of Somalia. Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs and emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. As hygiene promoters will interact closely with students during hygiene promotion sessions and recreational activities, CISP will train this cadre on hygiene promotion, psycho-social support (PSS), and child protection and safeguarding. Specific Protection activities will include the mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, and awareness raising and training of community education committees (CEC) on child protection. CISP will also continue to engage with Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE) and train cluster partners and MoE staffs on safe schools contingency planning, DRR and emergency response. CISP will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, proposal development, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, CISP will provide cash grants to CECs. In return, CECs will contribute in-kind or cash to procure safe water and manage its distribution to students. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacity and improve school preparedness against armed attack and other natural disasters. Disability and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. CISP will coordinate enrollment drives through MoE and with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. CISP education department will utilize the existing synergies with CISP protection department to assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, and, as determined from the assessment results, targeted schools will develop appropriate action plans to address areas of concern. To measure the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, CISP will conduct an end line assessment. Through the CISP protection department engagement with CEC\u2019s and the regional Gender Focal Points (GFP\u2019s) of MoE, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.

        "description": "Somalia is in the process of transitioning from a 'failed' to a 'fragile' state with central and recognised governemental institutions. To date, the country remains divided by various political and clan factions and strong anti-governement elements who are benefiting from the availability remnants or war (ERW) such as landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) thereby significantly weakening the overall stability and security in Somalia. This project seeks to reduce the impact of landmines, unsecured ammunition stockpiles, UXO and other ERW have at regional level. Phase one will target Northern Somalia (Somaliland) where large clearance efforts are coming to an end in the next three years and where, until clerarance is completed, accidents will continue to affect rural communities. HALO will deploy four manual clerance teams and one mechanical team to clear 616,000m2 from 1 Setember 2016 to 31 December 2018. Phase two will take place in Southern Somalia where government credibility has been gradualy increasing and where making concrete steps to restore stability can significantly foster state's legitimacy. International funding for HMA in Somalia is contributing to the multilateral effort to stabilise Southern Somalia by addressing factors leading Somali populations to migrate to Europe in search of better futures. HALO\u2019s work in Southern Somalia began in 2015, and a process of slow, steady development is being undertaken to minimize risks to the programme.",

        "description": "UN Joint Programme for Local Governance and Decentralised Service Delivery, (UN JPLG) Phase III is a pooled basket funded programme implemented by UNDP (contracting agency), ILO, UNICEF, UNCDF, and Habitat in all the regions of Somalia and Somaliland. Phase III of the programme started on 1st July 2018 and is envisaged to end on 30th June 2023. Federal governance structures in Somalia, all highlight a need for focusing on the third level of government (the district) as part of the federal consolidation and new state formation, without which genuine stability, encompassing most citizens, will not be realized. The Government of Somalia has identified the unique role local governments have in strengthening social contracts and contributing to service delivery and their role in building the legitimacy of the state and improving the resilience of communities to shocks, conflict and disasters. Establishing and capacitating local governments to promote good governance is included as national priorities in National Development Plan (and associated State Development Plans) as well as the Stabilization Strategy under the Comprehensive Approach to Security (CAS) and the Wadajir Framework for Local Governance. UN JPLG III is best placed to support the Government of Somalia to achieve local governance goals because of the implementation history of JPLG I and II and the long-term partnerships formed with local authorities. JPLG III will support the state to achieve context specific goals for local governance as well as contribute to strengthening the capacity of government to lead coordination at Federal, state/central and district levels. This would be achieved through  support to policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance; strengthening the capacity of local governments to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace and improve the engagement between citizen and local government, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups.",

Innovative participatory processes such as crowdsourcing, participatory video, and the use of PDRC\u2019s mobile audio-visual unit (MAVU) will allow the capturing ideas, filling the gap in regards to jobs and skills for rural and pastoral communities, analysis of the skills, needs and available markets in the selected regions, and dissemination of the importance of community dialogue and mental health skills for a sustainable and successful linkage between jobs and skills. The idea is not only to understand how these groups perceive jobs and skills in the respective regions but also to engage them in developing participatory solutions to tackle overlooked, negative or stereotyping aspects in the community.",

        "description": "This project addresses the need for locally trained female teachers and teaching assistants in Galgaduud region of Somalia, which until seven years ago had no tradition of education. This organisation has already opened eight schools and runs four literacy campaigns, but the difficulties of recruiting and retaining teachers are immense. There are very few trained teachers from the area, and teachers brought in from elsewhere tend to stay for only short periods, and are exclusively male. There is a severe shortage of trained teachers in Somalia, and very few women have had the opportunity to train up to a professional standard. This particular project provides teacher training through a two year certificate course run by a local university but based in schools. This means female student teachers can live at home, making accessing the training easier. Because they are drawn from the local area, they are less likely to leave the region. The impact will be long term and educationally significant.",

Second HALO will seek and destroy community held or abandoned stockpiles of ammunition held outside of state control across their area of operations in Souther\nn Somalia.

Although there have been improvements to the peace and security situation in Somalia since the formation of the Federal Government of Somalia in 2012, the overall situation remains fragile with Al-Shabab a major obstacle to peace and security. Forced displacement remains an ongoing a reality for people living in Somalia due to armed conflict, environmental hardships due to climate change, combined with inadequate resource distribution that is often exacerbated by clan based, ideological differences and land and natural resources competition. The COVID-19 pandemic has added yet another hazard that people in Somalia face. While it has now been over a year since the first case was detected in Somalia and efforts have been made to mitigate the risk, the situation is always evolving. With the main objective to ensure dignified, safe and secure living conditions and basic services for vulnerable populations affected by conflict and disasters in Somalia, IOM proposes an integrated camp coordination and camp management, Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and shelter and non-food item emergency support.",

Les deux \u00c9tats f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s (Jubaland et Sud-Ouest) b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront aussi de l\u2019appui donn\u00e9 durant l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux d\u2019infrastructure. Les activit\u00e9s du projet consisteront essentiellement en la construction et la gestion d\u2019infrastructures d\u2019alimentation en eau et d\u2019assainissement, ainsi que la fourniture de services li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019eau. Toutes ces prestations cr\u00e9eront des emplois, contribuant ainsi, dans une certaine mesure, \u00e0 l\u2019atteinte de l\u2019ODD 8, qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi d\u00e9cent pour tous.

Les tarifs et les redevances sur l\u2019eau seront revus, et int\u00e9greront des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tels que les tarifs minimaux, afin de permettre aux personnes en plus grande difficult\u00e9 d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux services d\u2019approvisionnement en eau. Les dossiers d\u2019appel d\u2019offres feront obligation aux entrepreneurs de respecter les normes fondamentales du travail et d\u2019assurer des formations de sensibilisation au VIH/sida, \u00e0 l\u2019intention de leurs employ\u00e9s et des communaut\u00e9s environnantes. Les personnes d\u00e9plac\u00e9es et les rapatri\u00e9s vivant dans les zones du projet profiteront aussi de ces interventions. Des \u00e9tablissements scolaires choisis b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront d\u2019installations am\u00e9lior\u00e9es d\u2019alimentation en eau et d\u2019assainissement, de la formation en hygi\u00e8ne et de la sensibilisation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.

This is the reality for people living in tents and makeshift shelters without running water or soap in places like Syria, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nBut, as we have seen in the UK, simple measures can make a huge difference.

        "description": "The key objective is to implement preventative measures for vulnerable groups that have limited access to COVID-19 prevention and response actions. This is to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in urban IDP settings. The intervention will focus on the most vulnerable groups: older people \u2013 forming approximately 2.7 per cent of the population and the urban poor and IDPs about 75% of the population. Assessments shows these as most vulnerable who are heavily impacted by COVID-19 infection. For this response, IRS seeks to complement the efforts of the government and other humanitarian organisation in Somalia by reaching approximately 40,000 beneficiaries directly and up to 200,000 indirectly.\n1. Risk communication and community engagement. The proposed project will support preventative measures to combat the spread of COVID 19. This will include extensive awareness initiatives using multiple media channels to support preventative action of the government and communities. The information/ education and communication is designed to reach the population  through print, audio-visual media messages, SMS and community mobilisation using religious/community/group leaders and elders. Display monitors on COVID 19 risks and prevention in local language will be installed at strategic locations such as roundabouts, airports and community centres in IDP camps.\n2.  Health: Strengthen existing health facilities in the selected IDP camps to combat COVID 19 infection. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to seven health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will also set up and equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections.\n3. WASH: Reduce the spread of COVID 19 and decrease morbidity and mortality in the selected districts. The project improve hygiene practices, limiting infection IDP camps.24 hand-washing stations will be built in the IDP camps in Bondhere, Baidoa, Balcad, Gardho and Burtinle. Hygiene kits, containing bath soap, laundry soap, 2 jerry cans, and facemask, will be supplied to 3500 households. Special consideration will be given to female headed household and PWD. \n4. Livelihood: Improving livelihoods through unconditional cash transfer of USD 70 for 3 months to 333 households, and USD 70 cash assistance for 2 months to 333 households as livelihoods support. The beneficiaries will be selected using robust selection criteria that targets the most vulnerable and prioritise female headed household. The UCT will be done using mobile money transfer which has the benefit of increased security, convenience, privacy, speed, reduced operational/transaction costs and logistics for the beneficiaries and for Islamic relief. Somalia has large mobile network reach. The choice of money gives the beneficiaries the widest range of transactional capabilities and broad access to basic financial services (such as deposit, withdrawal, person-to-person transfers and e-money transactions with registered traders of goods and service providers). Islamic Relief used mobile money in drought/ flood emergency programme (including WFP Baxnaano programme). The lessons from previous experience which guide the choice of UCT include: \n-  Beneficiaries purchase a more diverse set of goods, had higher dietary diversity,\n- Beneficiaries depleted fewer assets and grew more types of crops, especially marginal cash crops grown by women.  They are able to o restock livelihood assets faster. The reasons for this can be attributed to the lower costs and greater privacy of receiving a cash transfer via the mobile transfer, as well as changes in intra-household decision-making.\n5. Establish complaint management and feedback mechanism to the affected population. Through this intervention, IR MEAL unit will ensure that project delivers responses as designed to the affected population. Through an established mechanism of complaints mechanism and feedback channels, the affected population will be made to understand and demand their rights until all is provided to their satisfaction. \n6. Build and establish DRR community champions for covid-19 preparedness, response and treatment. The established committee is trained on covid-19 risk reduction management. Their role is to ensure that community members are made aware of the impact of covid-19, where to seek treatment and how to enforce containment measures such as social distancing and use of mask and sanitisers as part of exposure reduction. \nIRS will lead the implementation. The project will build on existing IRS interventions in health WASH and livelihood sectors and maximise the impact and sustainability",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021.

Zu diesem Zweck soll ein Insider-Netzwerk von engagierten Personen aus der Zivilgesellschaft gegr\u00fcndet und bef\u00e4higt werden, Mediation, Dialog und andere friedensrelevante Arbeiten vor Ort durchzuf\u00fchren. Zudem werden Workshops mit Akteuren der regionalen Verwaltung abgehalten, um ihr Bewusstsein f\u00fcr Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Frieden und Konflikten sowie Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf Konflikte zu sch\u00e4rfen und ihre F\u00e4higkeit zur Reaktion auf Konflikte auszubauen. Weiterhin werden in verschiedenen Distrikten Galmudugs gro\u00dfe Versammlungen im Rahmen des Gemeindedialogs organisiert, auf denen die Gemeindemitglieder lokale Konflikte und andere einschl\u00e4gige Fragen er\u00f6rtern und gemeinsam L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr diese Konflikte entwickeln k\u00f6nnen. Es wird 1-2 Mal im Monat ein regionales Radioprogramm produziert, in dem Friedens- und Konfliktthemen in verschiedenen Formaten diskutiert werden und an dem Zuh\u00f6rer aktiv teilnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Schlie\u00dflich werden die Anerkennung der Klimakrise und ihrer Auswirkungen auf Konflikt und Frieden sowie die Unterst\u00fctzung bei der Entwicklung von Ideen, wie die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels angegangen/reduziert werden k\u00f6nnen, in alle Projektaktivit\u00e4ten einbezogen.",

        "description": "Despite the increased frequency of disability data collection efforts in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) sites, the broader humanitarian community still possesses fragmented information about persons with disabilities living in Somalia IDP sites, and the barriers they face in accessing humanitarian services.  While initiatives by the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) cluster such as integrating the Washington Group Questions (WGQs) into the site verification exercise have attempted to highlight important site-level data, the reliance on key informant interview methodologies present challenges in obtaining accurate information. In addition to an absence in comprehensive disability data, humanitarian service providers continue to lack a clear understanding of the barriers and challenges that persons with disabilities face in Somalia IDP sites.  Therefore, there is a need for an extensive disability inclusion assessment in IDP sites that both look to collect important demographic data on persons with disabilities, in addition to illustrating methods for tailored delivery of humanitarian services to persons with disabilities in IDP sites.  The assessment will apply an intersectional gender lens and take into account the needs and the specific challenges faced by different sex and age groups. This type of study has not been able to be conducted in Somalia IDP sites due to the vast number of active IDP sites (+2400) and the scattered nature of their locations within district hubs and centers. The assessment will propose and support the integration of identified corrective actions to address barriers and challenges in the inclusion of persons with disabilities in humanitarian response.",

        "description": "In 2020, Somalia had been hit by Multiple threats from Covid-19, locusts, conflict, insecurity, forced evictions, droughts, and flooding. The number of people in need has consistently increased over the last three years, from 4.2 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020 and 5.9 million in 2021 according to the CCCM cluster Acaps review. This is further reflected in the number of displaced people in 2020/2021. 47% of the population of 12.3 million needs some form of humanitarian assistance, including 2.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), with an additional half a million displaced on average per year as a result of climatic conditions and conflict. Most displacement-affected persons face multiple or recurrent displacements, with a majority of IDPs having been displaced at least five times previously and very few return to areas of origin. Post-Gu IPC analysis conducted in September 2020 by FEWSNET and partners, indicates that an estimated 1.7 million people are anticipated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with 0.4 million persons experiencing an emergency (IPC Phase 4). An additional 3.0 million persons are expected to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2), with the current conditions projected to remain unchanged by end of 2020. Projections running into 2021, through May, predict continued Stressed (IPC 2) and Crisis (IPC 3) outcomes to persevere, largely due to continued struggles of affected households to overcome shocks. Households in IDP areas in the Banadir region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by the high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large-scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. Camp coordination and camp management is a relatively a concept that\u2019s limited within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized to this concept. \n\nSCC will implement these activities in 20 IDP sites in Kahda district of Banadir region with over 30,000HHs as per the latest detailed site assessment (DSA), targeting a largely underserved area. Approximately 36000 IDPs (6000 households) will benefit from this proposed intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding, or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys, and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age, and diversity dis-segregated data. SCC will implement this intervention in the Kahda district of Banadir region targeting 6000 HHs. Kaxda District is one of the IDP major hubs in Mogadishu that hosts the largest number of IDPs. Throughout the project, the needs of women, girls, men, and boys of all ages will be addressed throughout the planning, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation of the activities. Through regular site monitoring, needs and gaps will be reported and shared with partners and all stakeholders. Particular attention regarding needs will be paid to women and girls who also have to contend with GBV and protection concerns within camp settings. Through this project, SCC will also address the current and newly identified needs by setting up camp coordination structures at the national and, where necessary, regional or district levels, facilitating and supporting the establishment of effective coordination and management in IDP sites while respecting national context and authorities.",

        "description": "This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 36,000 IDP persons from 40 settlements in Kahda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including enhancing the capacity of camp governance structures and site-level committees to promote information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include organizing site-level coordination meetings among service providers and local authorities to highlight priority needs and challenges, mitigate protection risks and ensure efficient use of existing referral pathways. 10 site-level mobilizers, each serving as a focal point for 4 sites, will be hired from target IDPs to circulate key messages, report on gaps, conduct service mapping, needs and new arrivals, conduct site monitoring and take shelter-level CFM complaints in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address vulnerabilities and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nSite maintenance committees and IDPs in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out. In the selection of cash-for-work beneficiaries, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complaint mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population. Target sites will be prioritized based on vulnerability such as congestion levels, proportion of minority groups, potential exposure to protection risks and overall living conditions. AVORD will utilize cluster tools such as the IDP site risk map or DSA data in the process of site selection. A site-level Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be developed and the project team will ensure that the system is accessible for all populations and that the mechanism is clearly understood and supported by the community.\n\nThe present proposal will complement an interagency program currently being implemented by AVORD and other partners in Banadir to provide WASH and awareness raising services to reduce Covid 19 transmission. Synergies will be developed with these activities to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the resources.",

        "description": "The proposed 12-month intervention will aim to close the gap between crisis-affected children and enrolment as well as retention in schools. This is through improving access to quality education, increase access to critical WASH inputs and enhance child protection mechanisms in 15 schools that are among the priority schools for the education cluster that are at a high risk to close or have closed due to drought in Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. These schools are: Almaamum and Balihoowd primary in Balanbale Cumar Khadaab and Lajide primary in Xeraale Tawakal, Dugsiga H/dhexe and Howlwadhaag primary schools in Abudwak Xananleey, Alma\u2019mun, and Higlaale primary in Dhusamareeb Mucalim Ibrahim and Kobciye IDP primary in Guriceel and Kulmiye IDP, Docoley and Dayax primary in Cadaado. The identified needs in the 15 schools include water shortage, poor state of classroom and WASH facilities, shortage of teaching and learning materials, limited access to dry food rations, low attendance rate of teachers due to lack of incentives, low awareness on child protection reporting mechanisms by students and teachers, poor hygiene in the schools due limited access to clean water for drinking and handwashing. These needs have affected attendance and retention of learners in the 15 targeted schools. The main gaps in delivery of quality education services in the 15 schools include limited capacity of the Ministry of Education to provide the required education services due to budgetary constraints lack of intervention by other education partners due to the remoteness of the school that contributes to inaccessibility and security challenges to operate in these areas recurrent drought and intermittent conflict leading to loss of livelihoods for the communities in the targeted locations. The project will target to directly reach 2,315 learners out of which 1,266 boys and 1,049 are girls, 30 teachers translating to 2 teachers plus 1 head teacher per school, 30 community hygiene promoters and indirectly reach 45 CEC members. Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, water trucking to the schools to ensure a regular supply of water to the schools during drought, construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with community hygiene promoters (CHPs). To ensure inclusion of students with disabilities, child, gender and disability friendly latrines will be constructed with accessibility ramps and door sizes made within the required inclusion standards to enable access by students with disabilities to these facilities. CISP will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by drought and displacement. To ensure centrality of protection in the schools, CISP will assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, appoint and train protection focal points in the schools to strengthen feedback and reporting mechanisms to address protection concerns in the schools., Through engagement with ministry officials such as Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education  MoECHE Gender Focal Points,  the Ministry of Women and Human rights Development MoWHRD Regional Child Protection Coordinator and CECs, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

Further, the intervention proposes to support learner retention, improve learning environment and ensure safety of learners. The intervention has been designed to meet the needs of vulnerable girls, women, boys and men, IDPs and host communities in the three target districts (Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow). In ensuring centrality of protection, the program has been designed to enhance awareness/dissemination of child protection amp safeguarding principles with targeted girls and boys through establishment of leadership networks/clubs/platforms in targeted public schools in Gedo region. The intervention has based a big bulk of its outputs towards supporting IDP children (70%) and children from vulnerable host communities to enroll in permanent functional schools within Gedo, to ensure sustainability. The intervention is designed to build on gains made by the ongoing Education Cannot Wait (ECW) project as well as DFID funded Leave No Girl Behind (LNGB) which targets the same schools and locations, and to leverage and complement on other sectoral interventions in the same schools (WASH, Protection, Health), and will adopt an integrated approach that will focus on drought, protection, COVID-19 prevention and control, and life-saving interventions. In order to ensure access to safe and protective learning environment for vulnerable learners, the intervention shall among other key interventions: construct/rehabilitate TLS, provide safe drinking water hygiene promotion in schools (including COVID-19 prevention and control messaging), distribute sanitary kits to girls, establish school WASH facilities based on need, distribute TLM, pay emergency teacher incentives, provision of school feeding program as well as implementation of child protection activities in line with the education and child protection integrated response framework. The intervention will be implemented in a total of eighteen (18) schools in Gedo Region. The final list of schools will be agreed upon together with the Gedo Education Cluster Focal Point (HIRDA) to ensure that only the most needy drought-affected schools are supported.

        "description": "The NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO\n\nIn response to, and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed of 4 INGOs: Halo Trust, IRC, INTERSOS, FCA and 1 LNGO SYDAVO), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training and preparation to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support. Information is shared on adhoc basis daily or several time a day as alerts if the security incident requires the immediate action of NGOs and scheduled products are sent every week, every fortnight and every quarter\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor assistants (all INSO staff have their own network to source information as they are very close to the community and in contact with a wide range of local actors), NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 57,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO Training Team runs training programs which targets both individual safety and management of the organization's security. Finally, INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs.\nThe project budget leans heavily in HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "Critical humanitarian needs persist in Somalia across the different livelihood groups whose vulnerabilities continue to worsen due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic and escalating conflict. The poor Deyr rains (October to December 2020) led to the inadequate pasture for livestock, water shortage and below average crop production. The deteriorating food security outlook combined with the worsening malnutrition appeals for a rapid, well-targeted and coordinated scale up of responses to save lives and recovery of livelihoods assets. The project aims to improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihood assets related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages through conditional cash transfers to enhance livelihood opportunities and rehabilitation of water infrastructures and provision of fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in agro-pastoral and pastoral villages in Belet-Hawa district, Gedo region. \nThe project will target 815 vulnerable drought affected agro-pastoral and pastoral households among women, men, boys, girls, including female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The detrimental effects of the current shocks have severely and directly affected rural communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk leading to household food insecurity, increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and livestock use. Additionally, the affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debts. \nCOOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation process, target communities, especially women, girls and the disabled will be included in community representative committees and decision making processes In selection of beneficiaries, registrations, verifications and monitoring exercises so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, conditional cash transfer will be provided to 815 affected household including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services.\nTo restore livelihood assets of households, 815 beneficiaries will engage in cash for work activities construction and/or rehabilitation of water catchments and water harvesting structures (soil bunds), 150 households among the CFW beneficiaries will also be provided with fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in the areas where soil bunds structures have been constructed to regenerate pasture to ensure availability of fodder for livestock. This activity aims at restoring livestock assets of the communities and envisages reducing workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, gender based violence and exploitation malpractices associated with in search of livestock feeds and water for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed activity. In summary the following activities will be carried out:\n1. Provide conditional cash transfer to 815 households in Belet-Hawa district to increase household purchasing power and rehabilitate livelihood assets and water sources.\n2. Support to fodder production through provision of Sudan grass seeds) for 150 affected households in Belet-Hawa district.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Somalia is deteriorating due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflict About 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, an increase from the 5.2 million reported in 2020. Up to 2.7 million people are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse and will face acute food insecurity through mid-2021. An estimated 840,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, 143,000 of them severely and at risk of death. According to Somalia HNO for 2021 the protracted crisis in Somalia, compounded by COVID-19, floods and droughts, has resulted in massive challenges in meeting the WASH needs of the Somali population. According to the JMCNA, approximately 8.9 million people are affected by poor WASH conditions. For 2021, it is estimated that 4.6 million people are in catastrophic (10 per cent), severe (9 per cent) or extreme (18 per cent) need of humanitarian WASH assistance. The 10 per cent of households in catastrophic need mainly face a lack of access to water both in terms of quality and quantity, accompanied by a lack of access to functional sanitation. It is also a cause of relapse for acute diarrheal diseases when treated patients and children return to their communities with limited safe water and sanitation coverage, resulting in limited sustainability of health programs.\nAccording to assessment conducted by BTSC in Nov,2020 findings revealed that majority of the households (63.3%) use unsafe water from a water catchment or a dam as their primary source for drinking water and the said dam has dried up and the cost of 200 litters of water is currently costing between $3-$4 US Dollars which is not affordable to the drought affected communities. Additionally, 43.5% of sampled households do not treat drinking water. The assessment also revealed that only 45% of the resident do have access to latrines and 98% of those latrines are not accessible to people with disabilities. only 37.5% of the assessed families reported to have access to soap.\nIn the context mentioned above GRRN will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1)Improve access to safe water through water trucking to 10,000 drought affected population in priority sites /settlements/ communities targeting in Bay(Burhakaba). Rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures one borehole and 6 shallow wells with hand pump. (2) Construction of water infrastructures including construction of tanks and distribution networks, hybrid solar water pumping system in Burhakaba Borehole (Site selection should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions). (3)Establishment of gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity` of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects.(4) construction of 60 latrines in settlements (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) hosting new displaced population. (5) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and 1,500 hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes) accompanied by robust hygiene promotion activities. GRRN WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings, WASH Chapter as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. The total beneficiaries targeted in this project are 14,000(6,720 women, 4,480 men, 1,680 girls and 1,120 boys) in Burhakaba.",

        "description": "The impact of the ongoing drought compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict and forecast of below-average Deyr rainfall from April to June 2021 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood followed by drought in the Jalalaqsi district to 15,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved and/or hard to reach communities from 5 villages under Jalalaqsi namely Doondheere, Raafey, Habar robe, Cadiley, Sheeloow, Dirggoys east, Buulo Barwaaqo, Baqdaad east and Jalalaqsi town. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project are the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) for a period of 45 days. (Site of the distribution selection by the women/girls should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions).\n\n- Construction of 5 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps in 5 villages in Jalalaqsi district, (Baqdad east, Dirgoys east, Raafey, Dondheere, and Bulo Barwaaqo) with special consideration on disabled and child-friendly accessibility.\n- Upgrade one borehole in Jalalaqsi town (Amaana Borehole) Howlwadaag section of Jalalaqsi town, equipped with the hybrid system including rehabilitation of existing water tank, construction of water kiosk for human use, Construction of engine room, and piping network.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 6 WASH committees and 12 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting.\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. nevertheless, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion compounded with covid-19 awareness campaigns to reach 15,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health, and feeding centers. \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out. \n-Distribute 500 HP kits to 500 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 58 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods to the most affected community including 5 latrines especially constructed for disabled people.\nTo  strengthen the local markets-Based Programming (MBP) approach AADSOM will ensure that:\n- The service providers should be selected locally if available.\n- The contracted service providers should purchase the required material and equipment in the local market if available.\n- The contracted service provider should hire skilled and skilled workers from the local people.",

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s prolonged humanitarian crisis is characterized by ongoing conflicts, climate-related shocks, communicable disease outbreaks, and weak social protection mechanisms. Since the beginning of 2020, three additional shocks have contributed to a deterioration of humanitarian conditions: Extensive floods, Desert Locust infestations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These compounding shocks have exacerbated humanitarian needs among a population already living under the strain of widespread poverty and decades of armed conflict and insecurity. Climate change continues to be a major contributing factor to displacement and food insecurity in Somalia.\nIncreasingly erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions and floods, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Flooding displaced 919,000 people in 2020 and destroyed essential infrastructure, property, and 144,000 hectares of agricultural land. a serious lack of access to clean water and sanitation is heightening the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases exacerbating existing fragilities, especially where health services are too few and/or too distant. In this project, ARD is aimed to improve access to WASH services for Ceelberde IDPs, host communities with recognition of people of disabilities, and the most vulnerable population through the provision of safe water drinking with water vouchers for 60 days period,. Construction/rehabilitation of 22 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps, benefiting around 11,000 (2500 men, 5700 women, 1400 girls, and 1400 boys) crisis-affected IDPs and host communities will be under taken. ARD will also construct 50 flood-resistant latrines to benefit residents in the Ceelberde IDP sites which will also receive the clean water and hygiene promotions and hygiene kits. Approximately, 10% of the 50 latrines (corresponding to 5) will be preserved for people with disabilities living in the target locations. A total of 2500 (500 men, 1500 women, 250 girls, and 250 boys) people will benefit from access to the sanitation, 1000 Households will benefit from hygiene kit distribution and hygiene awareness, Chlorination of wells and WASH committees will be established in addition, carry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Ceelberde district,",

While international donors, including Canada, have already stepped up with humanitarian assistance to save lives and protect livelihoods, a significant funding gap persists and humanitarian needs are expected to escalate well into 2017. The impact is most pronounced in Ethiopia, which experienced its worst drought in 50 years, leaving 10 million people in need of emergency food assistance. In the Americas, Haiti is one of the most affected countries, with a third consecutive year of drought, exacerbated by El Ni\u00f1o, leaving more than 3.6 million people food insecure. Similar impacts are being felt around the globe. To date, twenty three countries have appealed for help to meet critical needs, including food, agricultural support, and water and sanitation.  With GAC's support, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is promoting early recovery and resilience building in some of the countries worst hit by El Ni\u00f1o, including Ethiopia, Haiti, Malawi, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Although specific programming differs based on the context in each country, FAO is protecting the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable groups, such as subsistence farmers and pastoralists, with agricultural inputs and livestock support.",

The poorest are widespread particularly among populations living in e.g. rural areas and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements. The humanitarian crisis in Somalia has for decades been one of the most complex and protracted emergencies in the world with climate-induced hazards (recurrent droughts and flashfloods), locust plagues and ongoing conflict. The country continues to be fragile with a population which frequently faces the predicament of too frequent shocks that do not allow ample time for recovery from local coping mechanisms.  \n\nClimatic changes which are likely to increase in both frequency and severity strongly impact on-going conflict dynamics, which in turn, significantly affect the livelihood of already vulnerable communities, especially through the effects on migration, forced displacement and loss of income generating resources/assets. The absence of livelihood options and the increase in poverty contribute to grievances, conflicts and susceptibility to shocks. The accumulation of household debt is a key vulnerability for those Somalis whose livelihoods are negatively impacted by repeated extreme patterns of climate shocks and intermittent conflict. Grievances that are linked to group affiliation are particularly serious risk factors as they affect conflicts on multiple severity levels.\n\nThe main objective of this contribution is to construct and contribute to the establishing a NEOC which will be the national hub for all emergency management planning and response, and the host the Federal Government (FG) level strategic response during a disaster situation in coordination and collaboration of the Federal Member States.",

        "title": "NRC :s Humanit\u00e4r Program 2021-2025",
        "description": "NRC is Norway\u2019s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida's Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC's capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida's humanitarian unit's annual budget appropriation which is substantial.\nThe objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: \"To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.\" It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.\nNRC\u2019s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.\u00a0Sida's Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC's method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).\nMore specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.\nAs an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:\u00a026% for Shelter and settlements,\u00a020% for\u00a0 Education,\u00a017% for Livelihoods and Food Security,\u00a014% for ICLA,\u00a09% for WASH,\u00a03% for Camp Management and\u00a011% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.\nThe good scores of NRC in ITAD's evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.\nDescribing NRC's activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC's work.\u00a0\nSHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC's expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in\u00a0protracted displacement situations.\nLIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life\u00a0and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten\u00a0livelihoods and individuals' and households' abilities to earn a living.\nICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one's rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC's lawyers.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to people to claim\u00a0and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative\u00a0dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity\u00a0documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge\u00a0around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face\u00a0particular obstacles in accessing their rights.\nEDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education\u00a0with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education\u00a0interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.\nCAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp\u00a0management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and\u00a0protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation\u00a0mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback\u00a0mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.\nWASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of infrastructre for\u00a0water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.\nSida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida's funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.\u00a0\nRRM Allocation 2021\nIncluded in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC's capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida's funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.\nMethod- and capacity-building projects\nIncluded in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp; advocacy forums at the national level.\n- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it\u00a0focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the \u2018Safe Programming\u2019 framework defining minimum commitments for NRC's operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in 'refugee-like' situations.\n- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to\u00a0ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC's ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.\n- Sida's support to NRC's CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.\n-\u00a0NRC\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida's humanitarian unit and Sida's unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at\u00a0generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida's Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.\n- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.\u00a0NRC's active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida's support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC's commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.\n- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida's humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.",

In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.\nNRC\u2019s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.\u00a0Sida's Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC's method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).\nMore specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.\nAs an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:\u00a026% for Shelter and settlements,\u00a020% for\u00a0 Education,\u00a017% for Livelihoods and Food Security,\u00a014% for ICLA,\u00a09% for WASH,\u00a03% for Camp Management and\u00a011% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.\nThe good scores of NRC in ITAD's evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.\nDescribing NRC's activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC's work.\u00a0\nSHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC's expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in\u00a0protracted displacement situations.\nLIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life\u00a0and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten\u00a0livelihoods and individuals' and households' abilities to earn a living.\nICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one's rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC's lawyers.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to people to claim\u00a0and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative\u00a0dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity\u00a0documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge\u00a0around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face\u00a0particular obstacles in accessing their rights.\nEDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education\u00a0with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education\u00a0interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.\nCAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp\u00a0management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and\u00a0protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation\u00a0mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback\u00a0mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.\nWASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of infrastructre for\u00a0water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.\nSida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida's funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.\u00a0\nRRM Allocation 2021\nIncluded in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC's capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida's funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.\nMethod- and capacity-building projects\nIncluded in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp; advocacy forums at the national level.\n- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it\u00a0focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the \u2018Safe Programming\u2019 framework defining minimum commitments for NRC's operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in 'refugee-like' situations.\n- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to\u00a0ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC's ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.\n- Sida's support to NRC's CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.\n-\u00a0NRC\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida's humanitarian unit and Sida's unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at\u00a0generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida's Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.\n- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.\u00a0NRC's active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida's support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC's commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.\n- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida's humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.",

Eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, progressively ensuring a world in which people at all times have sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life;\n2. Elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods;\n3. Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.\nBased on the global goals, FAO has formulated five strategic objectives:\n1. Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition\n2. Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable\n3. Reduce rural poverty\n4. Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems\n5. Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises\nThe Strategic Framework also includes a sixth, broad objective on technical quality, knowledge and services (including cross-cutting themes) that is designed to cover FAO\u2019s internal capability to deliver its strategic objectives. The objectives are in alignment with FAO\u2019s commitment to working in partnerships.\nIn humanitarian crises, FAO\u2019s main components are:\nTo help people to anticipate and prepare for crises; To respond fast to crises; To seek to reduce risks and address vulnerabilities.\nThe humanitarian operations are usually related to the 5th strategic objective which has the four following organizational outcomes (OO):\nOO1 - countries and regions have legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition;\nOO2 - countries and regions deliver regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food, and nutrition;\nOO3 - countries apply prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks for agriculture, food and nutrition;\nOO4 - countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition are prepared for, and manage effective responses.\nAt the next level in the FAO Strategic Framework, there are a number of outputs pertinent to humanitarian action, such as:\nOutput 4.1: Humanitarian action effectively protect lives and livelihoods of farmers, herders, Fishers, forest- and tree-dependent communities and marginal groups in times of crises.\nOutput 3.1: Strategies and related interventions improve the resilience of livelihoods systems at risk through prevention and mitigation efforts that minimize the potential impacts of disasters and crises on agriculture food and nutrition at national, subnational and community levels.\nOutput 2.2: Improved capacities of countries and communities to identify monitor and evaluate risks; conduct needs assessment and response analysis; and act on impending threats to agriculture, nutrition, food security and food safety (and related public health issues).\nOutput 3.3: Conflict-sensitive programmes on agriculture, food and nutrition reduce the risks of localized conflicts relating to access to grazing, forest and farming lands, fishing grounds, water, trees and other natural resources.\nAs Sida support FAO\u2019s operations through a variety of different projects in different contexts, this appraisal does not include an overarching results framework. In the annual follow up reading up to Sida\u2019s conclusion on performance all individual project reports will be analysed and assessed.",

        "description": "According to the project application the objective of the intervention is to promote high-level political dialogue processes as a means of contributing to improved peace and stability in Somalia. More specifically, to improve the political relationship between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and the Federal Member States (FMS); build the capacity of MoIFAR and FMS line Ministries in the implementation of the National Reconciliation Framework (NRF); and help resolve inter and intra-Federal Members States relations through dialogue. The Somalia National Reconciliation Framework/Plan will be used as a guiding document to holds all these elements together.\nThe project aims to continue building on and consolidating achievements made through Sweden\u2019s support to HD-facilitated work in Somalia to date. The project is based on three distinct but related dialogue streams or sub-objectives:\nPromote high-level dialogue between the FGS and FMS through the MoIFAR-led National Reconciliation Framework (NRF) implementation process that helps resolve political tensions between them and paves the way for consensus building on key issues including federalism, constitutional review, forthcoming election and security amongst other state building concerns. Facilitate capacity building and provision of technical advice by both local and international expertise to MoIFAR and FMS line ministries in the implementation of the NRF that informs and shapes the process while improving working relations between the FGS and FMS. Support dialogue processes for the FMS that helps them resolve inter and intra-state disputes that affects them helping in the building of more harmonious and mutually beneficial relationships.\nThese political dialogue processes in combination provide important building blocks for increased political stability in Somalia. The political developments in Somalia since the inception of the FGS have highlighted the importance of consultation and ownership by Somali leadership in order for the solutions to be sustained, achieve the necessary impact and stability on the ground. This project seeks to advance the objectives with the following activities:\nPromote high-level dialogue between the Federal Government of Somalia and the Federal Member States by: Continuing to work with senior representatives of MoIFAR at Federal and FMS levels as well as key advisors on reconciliation in the President/Prime Minister\u2019s office in reaching out to key high-level representatives to engage in the dialogue between the FGS and FMS; Working with MOIFAR using the NRF as an entry point in partnership with FBA and UN REFS to create an FGS-FMS inter-ministerial forum that will ultimately become the operational/implementation arm of the NRF process; Undertaking shuttle dialogue between key actors to develop strategies for getting buy-in and ownership of the top leadership at both the FGS and FMS level on the federal structure and other state building matters; Facilitating and convening dialogue between the FGS and FMS leadership in order to resolve conflict issues between them such as constitutional review, elections, federalism, security and agree on mechanisms to address any new arising matters;

Landet pr\u00e4glas av oj\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet och oj\u00e4mlikhet. Tv\u00e5 \u00e5rtionden av inb\u00f6rdeskrig och \u00e5terkommande humanit\u00e4ra kriser, inkl. hungersn\u00f6d, har h\u00e5llit landets befolkning i fattigdom och utsatthet. 2,3 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor har os\u00e4ker livsmedelsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning och \u00f6ver en miljon \u00e4r internflyktingar. Av en befolkning p\u00e5 ca 12 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor uppskattas till 73 procent vara fattiga och 43 procent leva i extrem fattigdom. En av sju barn d\u00f6r f\u00f6re sin f\u00f6rsta f\u00f6delsedag; en av arton kvinnor d\u00f6r i f\u00f6rlossningen; och endast en av tre personer har tillg\u00e5ng till s\u00e4kert dricksvatten. Brist p\u00e5 syssels\u00e4ttningsm\u00f6jligheter l\u00e4mnar m\u00e5nga unga somalier med f\u00e5 framtidsutsikter. \u00d6ver 70% av Somalias befolkning \u00e4r under trettio \u00e5r och arbetsl\u00f6sheten f\u00f6r ungdomar i Somalia \u00e4r 67 procent, en av de h\u00f6gsta i v\u00e4rlden. Kvinnor \u00e4r strukturerat diskriminerade. K\u00f6nsrelaterat v\u00e5ld \u00e4r extremt utbrett. Somalia har den h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rekomsten av kvinnlig k\u00f6nsstympning i v\u00e4rlden. Kvinnor saknar tillg\u00e5ng till r\u00e4ttvisa som kan skydda sina intressen. Bristen p\u00e5 ett formellt och effektivt r\u00e4ttssystem i de flesta delar av landet har lett till omfattande straffrihet. 2016 var Somalia rankat som det mest korrupta landet i v\u00e4rlden enligt Transparency Tnternational.\n\nMPTFen etablerades 2015 med Sverige som en av de f\u00f6rsta givarna att bidra till den nya fonden. Fondens hanterar idag totalt 187 miljoner USD. Det svenska bidraget \u00e4r det tredje st\u00f6rsta till fonden. Under perioden 2015-2017 har Sverige st\u00f6tt f\u00f6ljande FN program: Icke \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkt finansiering f\u00f6r program inom Peace Building Goal (PSG) 1 (val, konstitution, parlament och federalisering), icke-\u00f6rom\u00e4rkt finansiering f\u00f6r PSG 4 (Charcoal); \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkt finansiering av r\u00e4ttsstatsprogrammet (Rule of Law), \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkt finansiering av Ungdomsarbetsl\u00f6shetprogrammet \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkt finansiering av f\u00f6rvaltningsst\u00f6d.

Inkluderande politik och federalisering\n2. M\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter, fred och s\u00e4kerhet\n3. Ekonomisk utveckling\n4. Sexuell och reproduktiv h\u00e4lsa och r\u00e4ttigheter\n\nD\u00e4rtill avses ca 15 % \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkas till det s\u00e5 kallade \"Enablers programme\" som  innefattar st\u00f6d till FNs riskhandteringsenhet, avdelning f\u00f6r s\u00e4kerhet och trygghet samt Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO) vilket bed\u00f6mds vara avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r all tyd av genomf\u00f6rande p\u00e5 plats i Somalia. MPTFen utg\u00f6r inte enbart en finansieringsmekanism, utan \u00e4ven en m\u00f6jlighet f\u00f6r givarkoordinering i bredare bem\u00e4rkelse. De st\u00f6rsta givarna som EU, UK, USA, NO, DE, och DK finns fortfarande representerade.\n\nMPTF ett viktigt och helt centralt instrument f\u00f6r det internationella givarsamfundet och den somaliska regeringen i deras samarbete f\u00f6r att f\u00f6rverkliga de \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5len om fred och utveckling i Somalia. Slutsatsen \u00e4r att UNSF och MPTF kommer att harmonisera de betydande resurser som kanaliseras inom FN i Somalia och d\u00e4rmed leda till ett effektivare internationellt st\u00f6d till Somalia. Trots m\u00e5nga och allvarliga risker, \u00e4r det sannolikt att uppsatta m\u00e5l kommer att n\u00e5s till en rimlig grad om FN, deltagande givare och somaliska akt\u00f6rer samarbetar f\u00f6r att minska dessa risker. Sverige och andra givare kommer att spela en viktig roll i detta avseende. MPTF \u00e4r ett centralt instrument f\u00f6r att operationalisera Somalias utvecklingsplan i en tid d\u00e5 utsikterna f\u00f6r verklig fred \u00e4r b\u00e4ttre \u00e4n p\u00e5 \u00e5rtionden, samt f\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 viktiga resultat i den svenska resultatstrategin.\n\nAvtalsutkastet f\u00f6ljer den mellan UNDP och Sida \u00f6verenskomna mallen f\u00f6r den nu aktuella formen av samarbetsform.

The programme primarily targets women of reproductive age and children under five years of age for health services. Besides contributing to strengthened health systems, the intervention will increase the health seeking behaviour for women and make reproductive health services accessible and affordable for the target beneficiaries. The programme will further contribute to bridging the gap between health facilities and communities.",

OPC \u00e4r f\u00f6rankrat i den internationella arbetarr\u00f6relsen i de specifika landkontexter d\u00e4r projekten genomf\u00f6rs via lokala partnerorganisationer. Organisationen bildades i sin nuvarande form 1992 som den svenska arbetarr\u00f6relsens samarbetsorganisation f\u00f6r internationell verksamhet och opinionsbildning. OPC \u00e4r en av Sidas strategiska partnerorganisationer (SPO) och har ett p\u00e5g\u00e5ende samarbete med Sida inom regeringens CSO-strategi 2016 - 2022. OPC har \u00e4ven ett flertal st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n andra samarbetsstrategier. Det \u00f6vergripande programm\u00e5let \u00e4r \"st\u00e4rka civila samh\u00e4llet och progressiv utveckling f\u00f6r demokrati, j\u00e4mlikhet och h\u00e5llbarhet.\" \n\nOPC arbetar integrerat med tre huvudomr\u00e5den inom det internationella utvecklingssamarbetet: \n- folkligt deltagande \n- fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete \n- partipolitisk organisering (st\u00f6ds ej inom CSO-strategin.) \n\nOPC samarbetar i sina projekt med 27 olika medlemsorganisationer (MO) tex ABF, LO och Unga \u00d6rnar. Ett projekt innefattar oftast \u00e4ven samarbete med en lokal organisation d.v.s. en partnerorganisation (PO).\n\nSidas bed\u00f6mning \u00e4r att OPC har en unik kompetens och l\u00e5ng praktisk erfarenhet av demokratiutveckling och fattigdomsbek\u00e4mpning i Sverige och internationellt. Med expertis i st\u00e4rkandet av r\u00e4ttigheter, organisering och fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete, utg\u00f6r OPC en v\u00e4rdefull partner i samarbetet med Sida. \n\nOPC har sju lokalkontor i Asien, S\u00f6dra Afrika och p\u00e5 V\u00e4stra Balkan. Kontoren best\u00e5r av 1-3 anst\u00e4llda. OPC arbetar n\u00e4ra sina partnerorganisationer och \u00e4r uppskattade i dessa partnerskap. OPC bygger sitt arbete kring internationell solidaritet och erbjuder sina samarbetspartner kontakter inom internationella n\u00e4tverk. OPC genomf\u00f6r kurser om bl.a. kvinnors r\u00e4ttigheter, organisationsfrihet samt st\u00e4rker marginaliserade grupper om hur de kan utkr\u00e4va sina r\u00e4ttigheter. De st\u00e4rker sina partnerorganisationers kapacitet s\u00e5 att dessa i sin tur effektivare ska kunna f\u00f6retr\u00e4da sina medlemmar. St\u00f6det ska leda till att partnerorganisationerna kan verka som demokratiska f\u00f6rebilder och p\u00e5verka or\u00e4ttvisa samh\u00e4llsstrukturer.\n\nOPC OCH SIDAS SAMARBETE\nUnder tidigare avtalsperioder och under den nu p\u00e5g\u00e5ende avtalsperioden har Sida konstaterat att OPC vidareutvecklats inom flera omr\u00e5den. Sida har bl.a. noterat att OPC st\u00e4rkt sina system f\u00f6r intern styrning och kontroll samt att programmen \u00e4r mer logiskt sammanh\u00e4ngande. Det \u00e4r framsteg som Sida ser mycket positivt p\u00e5. Samtidigt har Sida ocks\u00e5  bed\u00f6mt en del omr\u00e5den som mindre tillfredsst\u00e4llande, bl.a. bristande f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att f\u00f6lja upp avvikelse\u00e4renden och l\u00e5ngsam omst\u00e4llning fr\u00e5n projektst\u00f6d till k\u00e4rnst\u00f6d. Vad g\u00e4ller integreringen av de tematiska perspektiven s\u00e5 har tydliga framsteg gjorts men \u00e4n \u00e5terst\u00e5r mycket arbete, s\u00e4rskilt vad g\u00e4ller milj\u00f6 och klimat samt j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet.\n\nANS\u00d6KAN F\u00d6R 2020-2024\nDen h\u00e4r insatsen avses finansieras under \"CSO-strategin 2016-2022\" samt \"Myanmarstrategin 2018-2022.\" Ans\u00f6kan inkluderar flera program som ryms inom ett \u00f6vergripande program kopplat till CSO-strategin samt ett landprogram f\u00f6r Myanmar. Det \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let f\u00f6r programmet \u00e4r att st\u00e4rka civila samh\u00e4llet och progressiv utveckling f\u00f6r demokrati, j\u00e4mlikhet och h\u00e5llbarhet. Ans\u00f6kan baserar sig p\u00e5 OPC:s internationella strategi 2020-2025. OPC:s f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringsteori utg\u00e5r fr\u00e5n fyra olika slags akt\u00f6rer: beslutsfattare, r\u00e4ttighetsb\u00e4rare, n\u00e4tverk/allianser och partnerorganisationer. Programmens fokus \u00e4r hur dessa akt\u00f6rer kan samverka f\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 progressiv utveckling.  \n\nVad OPC menar med \"progressiv utveckling\" kommer till uttryck i OPC:s fem politiska prioriteringar som \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: \n1. Motverka hot mot demokrati och m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter\n2. St\u00e4rka j\u00e4mlikhet och arbetsvillkor - bygga nya allianser and arbeta f\u00f6r progressiv politik\n3. H\u00e5llbarhet utifr\u00e5n r\u00e4ttvis omst\u00e4llning - motverka klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar\n4. Fr\u00e4mja fred och dialog - minska v\u00e4pnad konflikt och social oro\n5. Mots\u00e4tta sig tillbakag\u00e5ngen - \u00f6kad j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet\n\nDessa fem prioriteringar \u00e4r utg\u00e5ngspunkten f\u00f6r programmen. OPC arbetar med beteende- och systemf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring inom de fem politiska prioriteringarna. Enligt OPC leder beteendef\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna till att samh\u00e4llen och system blir mer demokratiska, fredliga, m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter respekteras i h\u00f6gre grad och social och ekonomisk oj\u00e4mlikhet mellan m\u00e4nniskor minskar. F\u00f6r\u00e4ndringen gagnar de grupper som har minst resurser, s\u00e4mst m\u00f6jligheter, lever i st\u00f6rst os\u00e4kerhet och har minst makt, d.v.s. de allra fattigaste. \n\nOPC st\u00f6ttar sina partnerorganisationer i deras ambition att \u00e5stadkomma samh\u00e4llsf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring. Vissa av partnerorganisationerna arbetar direkt med de allra fattigaste t.ex. i Myanmar, Sydafrika och Palestina, medan andra arbetar mot m\u00e5lgrupper inom sektorer som inte tillh\u00f6r de allra fattigaste t.ex. arbetare . Gemensamt f\u00f6r dessa insatser \u00e4r arbetss\u00e4ttet; de samarbetar genom att erbjuda organisering. \u00c4ven de partnerorganisationer som inte arbetar direkt med de allra fattigaste arbetar f\u00f6r f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring som gynnar de allra fattigaste. De grupper OPC framf\u00f6rallt fokuserar p\u00e5 \u00e4r kvinnor, marginaliserade grupper samt arbetare. \n\nSidas bed\u00f6mning \u00e4r att OPC har en relevant och logisk bredd av aktiviteter, fr\u00e5n st\u00e4rkande av r\u00e4ttigheter, utkr\u00e4vande av r\u00e4ttigheter och organisering, till strategiskt p\u00e5verkansarbete f\u00f6r att f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra lagstiftning och andra samh\u00e4llsstrukturer. \n\nI ans\u00f6kan planerar OPC verksamhet i ca 20 l\u00e4nder, inom fem regionala program och ett tematiskt program samt tre program som fokuserar p\u00e5 metodutveckling och kvalitetss\u00e4kring. Verksamheten f\u00f6rdelas p\u00e5 ca 120 partnerorganisationer, varav ca 1/3 bedrivs helt eller delvis av medlemsorganisationerna. OPC har budgetansvar f\u00f6r de resterande st\u00f6den till partnerorganisationer. N\u00e5gra av partnerorganisationerna kommer fasas ut medan andra nya organisationer fasas in under den kommande avtalsperioden. Omfattningen av verksamheten, b\u00e5de i form av inneh\u00e5ll och storlek, \u00e4r i huvudsak en forts\u00e4ttning av p\u00e5g\u00e5ende verksamhet. De planerade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna presenteras under stycke \"F\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar fr\u00e5n p\u00e5g\u00e5ende program.\"\n\nM\u00e5len \u00e4r formulerade p\u00e5 en \u00f6vergripande niv\u00e5 eftersom de ska inkludera verksamheten i 20 l\u00e4nder med sina specifika kontexter. M\u00e5len \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 formulerade mer som \u00f6nskade riktningar och tillst\u00e5nd \u00e4n som specifika situationer vid programmets slut. Detta beror fr\u00e4mst p\u00e5 att m\u00e5len syftar till att \u00e4ndra beteenden och attityder. Alla programmen kommer inte att fokusera p\u00e5 samma politiska prioriterade fr\u00e5gor men tillsammans bidrar alla programmen till de fem politiska prioriteringarna. M\u00e5lformuleringarna och indikatorer f\u00f6r verksamheten har formulerats av partnerorganisationerna och medlemsorganisationerna tillsammans med OPC, i workshops i respektive region. \n\nMilj\u00f6 och klimat, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, konfliktk\u00e4nslighet samt anti-korruption \u00e4r perspektiv som kommer att integreras i alla program. Med bl.a. personalf\u00f6rst\u00e4rkning avser OPC att arbeta med kompetensh\u00f6jande insatser, och med metodutveckling f\u00f6r b\u00e4ttre verktyg och strategier inom perspektiven. \n\nEtt av OPC:s huvudsyften \u00e4r att st\u00f6tta medlemsorganisationernas utvecklingssamarbete. F\u00f6r att ta vara p\u00e5 medlemsorganisationernas intresse och engagemang erbjuder OPC medlemmarna olika m\u00f6jligheter att delta i samarbetet med partnerorganisationer. OPC har tre olika projektstrukturer: \n\n- Fullt ansvar f\u00f6r ett projekt; medlemsorganisation har ansvar f\u00f6r alla delar av ett projekt, fr\u00e5n planering till utv\u00e4rdering. OPC vidaref\u00f6rmedlar medel till medlemsorganisationen samt kvalitetss\u00e4krar projektet. \n- Deltagande i projekt; OPC hanterar budgetansvaret. I de h\u00e4r projekten kan medlemsorganisationernas specialkunskaper i folkligt deltagande, fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete och partipolitisk organisering komma verksamheten till del \u00e4ven i de fall d\u00e5 den svenska organisationen saknar kapacitet att hantera budgetansvaret.\n- Fadder f\u00f6r ett projekt; medlemsorganisationen \u00e4r fadder f\u00f6r projektet och bidrar finansiellt till det. Den deltar i projektaktiviteter medan OPC ansvarar f\u00f6r projektets alla delar. \n\nSida anser att ett av OPC:s merv\u00e4rden \u00e4r att partnerorganisationerna kan dra nytta av medlemsorganisationernas erfarenheter, kunskap och n\u00e4tverk. \n\nBUDGET OCH ANS\u00d6KT BELOPP\nAns\u00f6kan, inklusive medel fr\u00e5n b\u00e5de CSO-strategin, Myanmarstrategin samt OPC:s egeninsats, har en total budget p\u00e5 613 208 006 SEK. Beloppet inkluderar \u00e4ven 2 000 000 SEK f\u00f6r verksamhet \u00e5r 2020 i Nordmakedonien. Under beredningen besl\u00f6ts det att insatsen i Nordmakedonien hanteras separat av den bilaterala strategin. Ans\u00f6kans reviderade total budget \u00e4r d\u00e4rf\u00f6r 611 208 006. Fr\u00e5n Sida s\u00f6ker OPC d\u00e4rmed ett bidrag p\u00e5 totalt 568 290 850 SEK f\u00f6r 2020-2024, varav det beloppet fr\u00e5n CSO-strategin \u00e4r 486 132 334 SEK. Egeninsatsen \u00e4r 10%. OPC ans\u00f6ker om en stor budget\u00f6kning, 21% av \u00e5rlig genomsnittlig budget under nuvarande avtalsperiod. F\u00f6r att visa p\u00e5 ett scenario med l\u00e4gre budget, inkom OPC i november med ett underlag d\u00e4r ans\u00f6kt belopp fr\u00e5n CSO-strategin var 471 157 666 SEK. Underlaget indikerar minskade ambitioner inom flera av de presenterade omst\u00e4llningarna i ans\u00f6kan. \n\nSida bed\u00f6mer det rimligt att OPC ans\u00f6ker om en h\u00f6gre budget i och med de f\u00f6reslagna f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna inom framf\u00f6rallt metodutveckling och intern kontroll. Sida bed\u00f6mer dock att den nuvarande verksamheten och de planerade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna kan hanteras med en mindre anslagsvolym, \u00e4n vad OPC ans\u00f6kt om. En del av de f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar som planeras har varit f\u00f6rem\u00e5l f\u00f6r m\u00e5ng\u00e5rig dialog mellan Sida och OPC och Sida bed\u00f6mer att OPC hittills inte har gjort de framsteg som f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntats. Sida anser att det \u00e4r av stor betydelse att OPC forts\u00e4tter att prioritera de presenterade omst\u00e4llningarna, \u00e4ven om den ans\u00f6kta budgeten inte beviljas i sin helhet.\n\nF\u00d6R\u00c4NDRINGAR FR\u00c5N P\u00c5G\u00c5ENDE PROGRAM\nDet f\u00f6reslagna programmet \u00e4r i stort en f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngning av det p\u00e5g\u00e5ende programmet avseende partnerorganisationer och verksamhetsl\u00e4nder. Flera av programmen \u00e4r omstrukturerade. OPC planerar f\u00f6ljande f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar inom programperioden: \n- \u00f6kade personalkostnader med 10%; f\u00f6r att vara b\u00e4ttre rustad att bedriva verksamhet i sv\u00e5ra kontexter, st\u00e4rka kapaciteten f\u00f6r internkontroll, metodst\u00f6d, och s\u00e4kerhetsfr\u00e5gor samt st\u00f6d till medlemsorganisationer i sitt samarbete med partnerorganisationer. Dessutom kr\u00e4vs \u00f6kade resurser f\u00f6r arbetet med milj\u00f6- och klimatomst\u00e4llning. Dessa f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar leder till att OPC st\u00e4rker sin f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att hantera sidamedel, b\u00e4ttre kan m\u00f6ta behov hos partner- och medlemsorganisationer samt st\u00e4rka sin f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att anpassa sig till nya globala f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar.  \n- \u00f6kad lokal n\u00e4rvaro i samarbetsl\u00e4nderna; antalet anst\u00e4llda vid lokalkontoren \u00f6kar f\u00f6r ge ett mer kvalitativt, och kostnadseffektivt st\u00f6d till  partner- och medlemsorganisationer tex ska fler lokala kontor \u00e4n idag ha en controller. \n- \u00f6kat finansiellt st\u00f6d till partnerorganisationer. \n- f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrad resultathantering; fr\u00e5n traditionell redovisning med f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda resultat och indikatorer till adaptiv management, d\u00e4r indikatorer ska v\u00e4gleda uppf\u00f6ljningen av verksamheten. Metoden kr\u00e4ver mer personella resurser men v\u00e4ntas ocks\u00e5 inh\u00e4mta ov\u00e4ntade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och resultat. \n- omst\u00e4llning av st\u00f6d till partnerorganisationer; fr\u00e5n finansiering av projekt inom partnerorganisationer till finansiering av hela organisationer, vilket leder till ett mer bist\u00e5ndseffektivt st\u00f6d. \n\nSida bed\u00f6mer att dessa f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar kommer att st\u00e4rka verksamheten och de f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntade resultaten, och v\u00e4lkomnar d\u00e4rf\u00f6r de presenterade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna. \n\nANDRA SIDA-ST\u00d6D\nOPC f\u00e5r st\u00f6d f\u00f6r sin verksamhet fr\u00e5n olika avdelningar p\u00e5 Sida. Sedan flera \u00e5r tillbaka har Sida uppmuntrat OPC att s\u00f6ka medel fr\u00e5n andra finansi\u00e4rer. OPC:s beroende av sidafinansiering \u00e4r fortsatt mycket stor. F\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande motsvarar det 84% av OPC:s totala inkomst f\u00f6r 2019.

Dessa var: j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, milj\u00f6 och klimat samt konflikt. Uppf\u00f6ljningarna genomf\u00f6rdes av sidar\u00e5dgivare och Sidas help desks. \n\nOPC:s ans\u00f6kan har beretts av en beredningsgrupp i en samberedning. F\u00f6ljande r\u00e5dgivare och/eller funktioner har ing\u00e5tt i gruppen: handl\u00e4ggare med ansvar f\u00f6r st\u00f6d till OPC, controller, resultatstyrning, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, handl\u00e4ggare med fokus p\u00e5 bist\u00e5ndseffektivitet och jurist. Beredningsgruppen har haft regelbundna avst\u00e4mningar i syfte att belysa OPC:s verksamhet och organisation utifr\u00e5n olika infallsvinklar och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra bed\u00f6mningen i sin helhet. Under beredningsprocessen har Sida haft flera m\u00f6ten med OPC, b\u00e5de i grupp och bilaterala mellan r\u00e5dgivare. Synpunkter har efterfr\u00e5gats fr\u00e5n relevanta svenska utlandsmyndigheter samt andra enheter p\u00e5 Sida som hanterar avtal med OPC.",

SMR har redan inf\u00f6r det nuvarande underavtalet f\u00f6r perioden 2017-2021 f\u00e5tt erbjudandet av Sida att komplettera med en till\u00e4ggsans\u00f6kan f\u00f6r perioden 2018-2019 som motsvarar SMR:s bed\u00f6mning och rekommendationer om st\u00f6d till PMU. D\u00e4refter har PMU inkommit till SMR med en ans\u00f6kan om bidrag fr\u00e5n SMR f\u00f6r perioden 2018-2019. \n\nBUDGET\nSMR ans\u00f6ker totalt om 122 000 000 SEK f\u00f6r tv\u00e5\u00e5rsperioden 2018-2019, ut\u00f6ver det redan avtalade beloppet om 790 000 000 SEK.

        "description": "Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) \u00e4r ett program-baserat partnerskap som inkluderar de minst utvecklade l\u00e4nder (MUL), givare och internationella organisationer. M\u00e5let \u00e4r att st\u00f6dja MUL att vara mer aktiva akt\u00f6rer inom det globala handelssystemet genom att hj\u00e4lpa dem att minska deras hinder inom handelssektorn. P\u00e5 detta s\u00e4tt arbetar EIF programmet mot ett \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5l f\u00f6r att fr\u00e4mja ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt och h\u00e5llbar utveckling. I dagsl\u00e4get best\u00e5r EIF av 23 givare, 6 multilaterala organisationer (IMF, ITC, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World Bank), 2 observat\u00f6rer (UNIDO och UNWTO) och 51 l\u00e4nder (48 MUL och 3 l\u00e4nder som nyligen l\u00e4mnade MUL kategorin). \n\nSida har gett st\u00f6d till EIF sedan 2009. St\u00f6det har uppg\u00e5tt till 120 MSEK f\u00f6r implementering av EIF fas 1 som p\u00e5g\u00e5r fram tills 2017. Den f\u00f6reslagna insatsen inneb\u00e4r att st\u00f6dja EIF:s implementering av fas 2 med 100 MSEK under \u00e5ren 2017-2021. Hela tidsperioden av EIF fas 2 omfattar \u00e5ren 2016-2022 och insatsens totala indikativa budget ligger p\u00e5 274-320 MUSD.\n\nEIF:s syfte \u00e4r of\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat i fas 2 och syftar till att st\u00f6dja MUL att: (1) integrera handel i nationella utvecklingsstrategier, (2) uppr\u00e4tta de strukturer som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att samordna leveransen av handelsrelaterat tekniskt bist\u00e5nd, och (3) bygga upp handelskapacitet, vilket \u00e4ven omfattar att ta itu med kritiska begr\u00e4nsningar p\u00e5 utbudssidan. \n\nFokus inom EIF \u00e4r kapacitetsuppbyggnad inom handelsfr\u00e5gor av MUL och framtagande av behovsanalyser, s\u00e5 kallade Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS). D\u00e4refter tar man fram landspecifika \u00e5tg\u00e4rdsmatriser i syfte att kunna identifiera akt\u00f6rer och finansi\u00e4rer som kan genomf\u00f6ra insatserna. I vissa fall implementeras och finansieras prioriterade \u00e5tg\u00e4rder direkt inom ramen f\u00f6r EIF. Exempel p\u00e5 s\u00e5dana prioriterade \u00e5tg\u00e4rder fr\u00e5n fas 1 \u00e4r \"High Value Silk\" projektet som syftar till att \u00f6ka konkurrenskraften hos den kambodjanska silke sektorn f\u00f6r att skapa arbetstillf\u00e4llen s\u00e4rskilt f\u00f6r kvinnor, st\u00f6d f\u00f6r anslutning till WTO och kapacitetsuppbyggnad f\u00f6r handelsinstitutioner, regeringstj\u00e4nstem\u00e4n osv. Vidare syftar EIF programmet till att st\u00e4rka givarnas st\u00f6d till landets egen handelsagenda. MUL kan anv\u00e4nda EIF som en mekanism f\u00f6r att samordna givarst\u00f6det och tillf\u00f6r mer resurser inom deras handelsagenda, medan givarna kan ansluta sig till EIF som en mekanism f\u00f6r att leverera p\u00e5 deras \u00e5taganden inom handelsfr\u00e5gan. EIF:s aktiviteter finansieras genom en multi-donor trust fund.\n\nEIF:s globala f\u00f6rvaltningsstruktur best\u00e5r av EIF styrkommitt\u00e9n, EIF styrelsen, EIF sekretariatet och en fondf\u00f6rvaltare. EIF:s styrkommitt\u00e9 fungerar som ett \u00f6vergripande ledningsorgan, medan EIF:s styrelse \u00e4r det beslutande organet f\u00f6r EIF-programmet och ger strategisk tillsyn. Styrelsen best\u00e5r av en representant fr\u00e5n varje multilateral organisation (IMF, ITC, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World Bank), tre representanter fr\u00e5n de minst utvecklade l\u00e4nderna och tre representanter fr\u00e5n givargruppen. EIF:s sekretariat \u00e4r den genomf\u00f6randepartner/operativa f\u00f6rvaltaren av EIF-programmet och \u00e4r en del av WTO:s huvudkontor i Geneve, Schweiz. UNOPS regionala kontor i Geneve fungerar som fond/finansiell f\u00f6rvaltare f\u00f6r EIF fas 2 och \u00e4r Sidas avtalspartner. \n\nP\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 leder en nationell EIF fokalpunkt sj\u00e4lva EIF processen i landet, en EIF donor facilitator arbetar tillsammans med EIF fokalpunkten f\u00f6r att underl\u00e4tta givarsamordningen och EIF:s nationella styrkommitt\u00e9 \u00e4r ett forum f\u00f6r beslutsfattande och samordning mellan statliga parter inom handel, den privata sektorn, det civila samh\u00e4llet och givarna i det specifika landet.",

Detta avbr\u00f6ts av inb\u00f6rdeskriget i b\u00f6rjan av 1990-talet. Ett initiativ togs 2014 f\u00f6r att bygga vidare p\u00e5 det tidigare samarbetet och d\u00e4rmed bidra till nationella \u00e5teruppbyggnad i Somalia. Ett konsortium bildades - det somalisk-svenska forskningssamarbetet f\u00f6r h\u00e4lsa (SSRCH) - och denna ans\u00f6kan ligger i linje med det handlingsprogram f\u00f6r kapacitetsuppbyggnad inom h\u00e4lsoforskning som konsortiet utvecklat.Det somaliska h\u00e4lsosystemet har allvarliga utmaningar. Kulturella normer, geografiska avst\u00e5nd och s\u00e4kerhetsproblem, \u00e4r n\u00e5gra hinder som finns f\u00f6r att anv\u00e4nda de h\u00e4lsostrukturer som \u00e4r p\u00e5 plats, om \u00e4n bristf\u00e4lliga. Detta medf\u00f6r att m\u00e5nga insatser med vetenskapligt p\u00e5visad effekt inte n\u00e5r befolkningen. N\u00e5gra exempel \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad efterfr\u00e5gan p\u00e5 vaccinationer och f\u00f6rlossningsv\u00e5rd, samt otillr\u00e4cklig behandling av smittsamma sjukdomar. Forskning kring h\u00e4lsoinsatser i den somaliska kontexten kan ge \u00f6kad kunskap som kan bist\u00e5 beslutsfattare och \u00f6ka h\u00e4lso- och sjukv\u00e5rdssystemets m\u00f6jlighet att framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6ra beslutade insatser. I dagsl\u00e4get \u00e4r insikten om vad forskning kan bidra med ofta begr\u00e4nsad.Under de senaste decennierna har vikten av evidensbaserad h\u00e4lso- och sjukv\u00e5rd, s\u00e5 \u00e4ven inom folkh\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det \u2013 uppm\u00e4rksammats och gett framsteg i m\u00e5nga h\u00f6ginkomstl\u00e4nder, men \u00e4nnu inte f\u00e5tt samma genomslag i flertalet l\u00e5g- och medelinkomstl\u00e4nder, inklusive Somalia. Evidensbaserad folkh\u00e4lsovetenskap inkluderar tillg\u00e5ng till b\u00e4ttre information om vilka insatser som fungerar, en st\u00f6rre sannolikhet f\u00f6r att framg\u00e5ngsrika program genomf\u00f6rs, \u00f6kad produktivitet i arbetskraften och effektivare anv\u00e4ndning av offentliga och privata resurser.Syftet med det f\u00f6reslagna \u2019SomSwe-projektet \u00e4r att uppr\u00e4tta ett n\u00e4tverk av somaliska och svenska akademiker f\u00f6r att utveckla institutionell kapacitet och vad g\u00e4ller forskning inom folkh\u00e4lsovetenskap, inklusive att st\u00e4rka rollen av evidensbaserad kunskap inom det somaliska h\u00e4lso- och sjukv\u00e5rdssystemet. N\u00e4tverket best\u00e5r av seniora akademiker fr\u00e5n somaliska och svenska universitet, en grupp juniora forskare fr\u00e5n b\u00e5da l\u00e4nderna och en r\u00e5dgivande grupp med representanter fr\u00e5n sju somaliska universitet, fem svenska universitet, samt somalisk diaspora.Under detta tv\u00e5-\u00e5riga projekt kommer \u2019SomSwe\u201d n\u00e4tverket att gemensamt utveckla och implementera en \u201dTraining of Trainers\u201d (ToT) modell riktat till l\u00e4rare/forskare vid somaliska universitet (med j\u00e4mn f\u00f6rdelning mellan kvinnor och m\u00e4n), som en strategi att utveckla kapacitet institutionellt och inom forskning vad g\u00e4ller evidensbaserad folkh\u00e4lsovetenskap. F\u00f6rst kommer social n\u00e4tverksanalysteori att anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att utv\u00e4rdera en ToT-kurs om genomf\u00f6rdes 2016-2018 inom det svenskt-somaliskt samarbete som n\u00e4mnts ovan. Utfallet kommer att nyttjas f\u00f6r att utveckla den nu planerade ToT-kursen med samma m\u00e5lgrupp som den tidigare och som planeras att genomf\u00f6ras 2021-2022. M\u00e5let \u00e4r att tre nya forskargrupper formeras och utvecklar sina forskningsplaner under kursens g\u00e5ng, men p\u00e5 sikt kommer sannolikt fler forskargrupper att formeras.Inom projektet kommer b\u00e5de somaliska och svenska forskare att utveckla sin kompetens inom social n\u00e4tverksanalysteori, samt evidensbaserad folkh\u00e4lsovetenskap inklusive forskningsmetoder f\u00f6r att ta fram denna kunskap. Detta kommer att bidra till att st\u00e4rka b\u00e5de somalisk och svensk akademin samt det Somaliska h\u00e4lsosystemet. Projektet kommer ocks\u00e5 att bidra till Somalias resa f\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 FN:s globala h\u00e5llbarhetsm\u00e5l.

About 26% of Somalia\u00b4s population live a nomadic life, and this significant group of about 4 million people is believed to have even less access to modern health care and health promotion than the rest of the population.This project aims to build up a network of knowledgeable researchers in Somalia, Kenya and Sweden to, together with representatives of the nomadic population and the Ministry of Health, build up a knowledge bank on nomadic health and health care access. The project will also develop a research application for deeper analysis of 1) central health problems to the nomad population, 2) obstacles to access health care, and 3) design and test interventions to create better access to both emergency care and elective care under the special living conditions of the nomadic population.The University of Gothenburg, KEMRI (Wellcome Trust funded health research program in Kenya) and Benadir University in Somalia are initiating this work but intend to join more partners over the next two years. During the project, three major workshops will be conducted in the relatively safe Hargeisa, Somaliland, and the database will be built by Benadir University.",

Programmet syftar till att m\u00f6ta barns humanit\u00e4ra behov och att skydda barn mot v\u00e5ld och f\u00f6rsummelse i humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer. Speciellt fokus i Programmet \u00e4r \"barn i v\u00e4pnade konflikter\". \n\nRBS \u00e4r en del av R\u00e4dda Barnen globalt (Save the Children International, SCI) som tillsammans har expertis f\u00f6r att svara p\u00e5 uppkomna krissituationer r\u00f6rande skydd av barn i n\u00e4ra samarbete med lokala partners. RBS \u00e4r en av f\u00e5 samarbetsparter till Sida som har ett fokus p\u00e5 skydd av barn och f\u00f6rankring av barns r\u00e4ttigheter i humanit\u00e4ra kriser. \n\nRBS \u00e4r en av Sidas tio-talet partnerorganisationer f\u00f6r humanit\u00e4rt bist\u00e5nd sedan 2013, d\u00e5 ett stort antal organisationer utv\u00e4rderades i syfte att ing\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre ramavtal med Sida f\u00f6r humanit\u00e4rt st\u00f6d. Sida utf\u00f6r \u00e5rligen en humanit\u00e4r allokeringsprocess som sedan ligger till grund f\u00f6r vilka organisationer, landprojekt och tematiska-/kapacitetsst\u00e4rkande projekt som ska beviljas finansiellt st\u00f6d. I enlighet med denna process, bed\u00f6mer Sida det relevant att under 2018 st\u00f6dja RBS humanit\u00e4ra Program i 6 l\u00e4nder, och att bidra med RRM-medel (Rapid Response Mechanism), samt st\u00f6dja ett antal tematiska-/kapacitetsst\u00e4rkande omr\u00e5den.\n\nSida har i huvudsak goda erfarenheter fr\u00e5n tidigare samarbete med RBS och dess humanit\u00e4ra insatser. Sida baserar detta p\u00e5 resultaten fr\u00e5n en extern utv\u00e4rdering (SIPU 2016), RBS resultatrapportering, samt Sidas f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljningar (som genomf\u00f6rts i 27 l\u00e4nder) under 2017. RBS har ocks\u00e5 minskat sin responstid f\u00f6r att svara p\u00e5 akuta krissituationer med drygt 50% (fr\u00e5n flera veckor till maximalt 4-7 dagar) under 2017. Detta har gjort att RBS kommer in snabbare \u00e4n ett flertal andra humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rer i kriser. Genom att slussa Sidas RRM-medel, efter godk\u00e4nnande av Sida, genom SCIs globala katastroffond, har detta blivit m\u00f6jligt, f\u00f6rst p\u00e5 pilotbasis under 2017, och fr\u00e5n 2018 p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt.\n\nUnder 2013 slutf\u00f6rdes en omstrukturering av R\u00e4dda Barnens organisation internationellt. Omorganisationens genomf\u00f6rande globalt har tagit tid och i vissa kontexter p\u00e5g\u00e5r den fortfarande. Den har f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat R\u00e4dda Barnens globala organisationsstruktur och styrning med syfte att harmonisera organisationens processer och system f\u00f6r att standardisera och kvalitetss\u00e4kra planering, programuppf\u00f6ljning, personals\u00e4kerhet, finansiell kontroll med mera. Viss finjustering med att synkronisera systemen inom organisationen globalt forts\u00e4tter, bl.a. inom RBS, under 2017-2019.\n\nSidas relevansbed\u00f6mning av de landspecifika projekten f\u00f6r 2018 och de tv\u00e5 fler\u00e5riga st\u00f6den f\u00f6r 2018 och 2019 baseras, som tidigare sagts, p\u00e5 en global behovsbed\u00f6mning som g\u00f6rs \u00e5rligen av Sida/HUM. Samtliga projekt har ocks\u00e5 granskats av relevanta geografiska handl\u00e4ggare p\u00e5 Sida/HUM samt av relevanta ambassader. Sida bed\u00f6mer att RBS i huvudsak uppn\u00e5r Sidas krav avseende f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntade resultat, men att RBS bl.a. beh\u00f6ver forts\u00e4tta f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra sin rapportering (inklusive resultatramverk med m\u00e4tbara m\u00e5l och tydlig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringsteori) till Sida f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en b\u00e4ttre resultatanalys. Under 2018 f\u00f6resl\u00e5r RBS ocks\u00e5 att forts\u00e4tta fokusera p\u00e5 vidareutveckling av kvalitetss\u00e4kring och uppf\u00f6ljning av landkontorens genomf\u00f6rande av insatserna. RBS kommer ocks\u00e5 att f\u00f6lja innovationsfonden, HIFs (Humanitarian Innovation Fund), arbete n\u00e4rmare under \u00e5ret. HIF kommer att p\u00e5b\u00f6rja aktiviteter igen med Sida-finansiering under 2018. Under 2017 utbetalades inga Sida-medel till HIF d\u00e5 resultaten fr\u00e5n en utv\u00e4rdering och revision av tidigare samarbete inv\u00e4ntades.

Humanit\u00e4ra samarbetspartners f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att svara mot dessa behov bed\u00f6ms i respektive kontext, varefter Sida f\u00f6resl\u00e5r l\u00e4mplig f\u00f6rdelning av tillg\u00e4ngliga humanit\u00e4ra medel till respektive land och partner. I b\u00f6rjan p\u00e5 \u00e5ret 2018 rapporterade FN att 135 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor i 26 l\u00e4nder \u00e4r i behov av humanit\u00e4r hj\u00e4lp. Det ber\u00e4knas att 815 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor \u00e4r kroniskt matos\u00e4kra. I v\u00e4rsta fall kan kronisk matos\u00e4kerhet leda till humanit\u00e4ra kriser i form av extrem hunger och sv\u00e4lt, vilket p\u00e5visades i flertalet kontexter 2017 och 2018 s\u00e5 som Somalia, Nigeria, Sydsudan och Jemen.\n\nFAO har \u00f6ver 194 medlemsstater och verksamhet i \u00f6ver 130 av dessa. I \u00f6ver 50 l\u00e4nder fokuserar arbetet p\u00e5 n\u00f6dinsatser som b\u00e5de r\u00e4ddar liv och st\u00e4rker m\u00e4nniskors sj\u00e4lvf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjande att st\u00e5 emot kriser som i l\u00e4ngden minskar humanit\u00e4ra behov och kostnader. FAO:s kamp mot sv\u00e4lt under 2017 innebar att fler \u00e4n 6 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor fick hj\u00e4lp i fyra l\u00e4nder, med bl.a. \u00e5teruppbyggnad av m\u00e4nniskornas egna matproduktion. Over 1 miljon m\u00e4nniskor fick kontanterst\u00f6d vilket gav m\u00e4nniskorna medel som de kunde anv\u00e4nda omedelbart f\u00f6r att \u00e5teruppta den egna sj\u00e4lvf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningen. Over 42 miljoner hush\u00e5llsdjur i fyra l\u00e4nder skyddades genom utbildning, djurh\u00e4lsokampanjer, tillg\u00e5ng till f\u00f6da och vatten.\n\nDe medel som ansl\u00e5s 2018 uppg\u00e5ende till 84 200 000 miljoner svenska kronor till FAO kommer att anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nedan projekt, uppdelade i tre kategorier.\n\na) Fler\u00e5riga projekt 2017\u20132019 (enligt tidigare beslut 2017\u2013000943)\nSida beslutade 2017 att st\u00f6dja Sahel-krisen med totalt 60 000 000 SEK under en tre \u00e5rs period (2017\u20132019). St\u00f6det till Sahel ligger p\u00e5 totalt 60 MSEK under tre \u00e5r, dvs. 20 MSEK per \u00e5r uppdelat per land sedan tidigare enligt f\u00f6ljande:\n\n1. Kamerun, 4 MSEK (12 MSEK)\n2. Mali, 6 MSEK (18 MSEK)\n3. Niger, 4 MSEK (12 MSEK)\n4. Tchad, 6 MSEK (18 MSEK) \n\nSida har \u00e4ven under tidigare perioder givit humanit\u00e4rt st\u00f6d till FAO f\u00f6r responsen i Sahel-kriserna. F\u00f6rutom att \u00f6ka m\u00e4nniskors motst\u00e5ndskraft mot effekterna av klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar, \u00e4r de f\u00f6reslagna projekten fr\u00e4mst inriktade p\u00e5 att svara p\u00e5 konsekvenserna av krig i regionen. Konflikt har lett till befolkningsf\u00f6rflyttningar, f\u00f6rlust av tillg\u00e5ngar, st\u00f6rningar p\u00e5 marknaderna och en \u00f6kad b\u00f6rda f\u00f6r v\u00e4rdsamh\u00e4llen.

Det sker genom att FAO i Tchad s\u00e4krar nutritionen f\u00f6r \u00f6ver 10,000 hush\u00e5ll och genom projektet i Kamerun f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrar jordbruksproduktionen f\u00f6r 9,000 hush\u00e5ll. I Mali kommer FAO att bist\u00e5 med mat och nutritionss\u00e4kerhet f\u00f6r 6,000 boskapssk\u00f6tande och jordbrukarande hush\u00e5ll, f\u00f6r b\u00e5de kvinnor och m\u00e4n, genom att rehabilitera betesmarker, f\u00f6rst\u00e4rka boskapsuppf\u00f6dningen och st\u00e4rka den lokala kapaciteten samtidigt. I Niger kommer \u00f6ver 232,800 m\u00e4nniskor, varav 120,000 kvinnor att ber\u00f6ras av projektets resiliensst\u00e4rkande aktiviteter. Projekten g\u00e5r 2018 in p\u00e5 \u00e5r tv\u00e5 med planerad utfasning under 2019.\n\nb) Ett\u00e5riga projekt \n5. Somalia 24 MSEK\n6. Nigeria 10 MSEK\n7. Nordkorea 8,2 MSEK\n\nSomalia: Sida bidrog tidigt under 2017 till att f\u00f6rebygga en \u00f6verh\u00e4ngande sv\u00e4ltsituation och bidrog till responsen mot torkan i Somalia. \u00c4ven 2018 \u00e4r ett \u00e5r d\u00e5 m\u00e4nniskor inte kommer att kunna m\u00f6ta sina egna matbehov utan hj\u00e4lp. St\u00f6d till matodling och djurhush\u00e5llning kommer att spela en central roll i f\u00f6rebyggandet av sv\u00e4lt samt att \u00e5terst\u00e4lla m\u00e4nniskornas m\u00f6jligheter att stabilisera den egna matf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningen, genom att sj\u00e4lva p\u00e5b\u00f6rja en \u00e5terh\u00e4mtningsprocess. St\u00f6d p\u00e5 20 MSEK f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att g\u00e5 till byggandet av motst\u00e5ndskraftiga f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningsm\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r att m\u00e4nniskor ska f\u00e5 proteinrik mat och st\u00f6d i att hush\u00e5lla djur i den m\u00e5n det \u00e4r m\u00f6jligt pga. f\u00f6rsv\u00e5rande omst\u00e4ndigheter som torkan har skapat. FAO kommer att st\u00f6dja 10,000 hush\u00e5ll (60,000 m\u00e4nniskor) med kvalitativt st\u00f6d till farmer och tekniskt st\u00f6d till att \u00e5teretablera sj\u00e4lvf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjande genom att bidra med h\u00f6gkvalitativa fr\u00f6n f\u00f6r att producera n\u00e4ringsrik sk\u00f6rd. D\u00e4rut\u00f6ver f\u00f6resl\u00e5s ett st\u00f6d p\u00e5 4 MSEK till Food Security and Nutrition Assessment Unit (FSNAU), som arbetar med uppf\u00f6ljning av matsituationen och bedriver nutritionsunders\u00f6kningar, analyser och bevakning av situationen vilket de somaliska myndigheterna sj\u00e4lva inte har kapacitet att genomf\u00f6ra.\n\nNigeria: FAO i Nigeria f\u00f6resl\u00e5s f\u00e5 10 MSEK i st\u00f6d f\u00f6r att \u00e5terbygga jordbruksbaserad f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning hos internt f\u00f6rdrivna m\u00e4nniskor s.k. \u201dInternally Displaced People\u201d (IDP), \u00e5terv\u00e4ndande flyktingar och s\u00e5rbara hush\u00e5ll i v\u00e4rdsamh\u00e4llen i nord\u00f6stra Nigeria. FAO planerar att st\u00f6dja 170,000 hush\u00e5ll under regns\u00e4songen och 100,000 hush\u00e5ll under torrs\u00e4songen genom att bl.a. bidra med getter till s\u00e5rbara hush\u00e5ll, framf\u00f6rallt kvinnodominerade hush\u00e5ll samt st\u00f6d till IDP genom vattenbruk.\n\nNordkorea: Under v\u00e5ren och sommaren 2017 drog en sv\u00e5r torka \u00f6ver Demokratiska folkrepubliken Korea (Nordkorea). FAO:s \u00e5rsrapportering kring matproduktionen i landet visade p\u00e5 ca. 7,5 % minskning j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med 2016. Delvist som en direkt respons mot torkans konsekvenser planerar d\u00e4rf\u00f6r FAO att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra mat- och nutritionss\u00e4kerheten f\u00f6r upp till 9 600 kooperativa farmer genom att a) st\u00e4rka riskbevakningen och system f\u00f6r tidig varning hos jordbruksministeriet (MoA), b) bygga kapaciteten hos MoA f\u00f6r att v\u00e4gleda implementeringen av \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r katastrofriskreducering samt klimatanpassning i jordbruket, och c) uppr\u00e4tta modeller f\u00f6r katastrofriskreducering och klimatanpassning f\u00f6r odling och boskapssk\u00f6tsel. F\u00f6r projektets aktivitetsperiod 2018\u20132019 f\u00f6resl\u00e5s 8,2 MSEK ur \u00e5rets allokering.\n\nc) Global niv\u00e5, ett\u00e5riga st\u00f6d\n8. Global Food Security Cluster (gFSC), 2 MSEK\n9. Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA), 20 MSEK\n\nGlobal FSC: En forts\u00e4ttning, genom ett st\u00f6d p\u00e5 2 MSEK, f\u00f6resl\u00e5s till det globala mats\u00e4kerhetsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningsklustret (Global Food Security Cluster, gFSC). FAO leder gFSC tillsammans med WFP med s\u00e4te i Rom. Genom gFSC bidrar FAO:s arbete till att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra st\u00f6det till nationella livsmedelsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningskluster genom kompetensh\u00f6jning och utplacering av r\u00e5dgivare vid humanit\u00e4ra situationer. En s\u00e4rskild anstr\u00e4ngning kommer att g\u00f6ras f\u00f6r att st\u00e4rka de nationella akt\u00f6rernas deltagande i klustersamordning.\n\nSFERA: FAO's Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA), f\u00f6resl\u00e5s f\u00e5 ett bidrag p\u00e5 20 MSEK. SFERA omfattar bl.a. A) kapacitetskomponenten inbegriper behovsbed\u00f6mningar, responskoordinering samt L3 n\u00f6drespons f\u00f6r snabbt st\u00f6d till landskontorens responsarbete. B) Programkomponenten syftar till att tillg\u00e4ngligg\u00f6ra medel f\u00f6r snabba och kontextspecifika insatser, t.ex. genom det s.k. Agricultural Inputs Response Capacity (AIRC) kan medel anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r omedelbar upphandling och leverans av n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt material. C) Early Action som skall f\u00f6rebygga och lindra effekterna av en katastrof p\u00e5 f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningsm\u00f6jligheter genom att skydda nyckeltillg\u00e5ngar s\u00e5 som boskap. Denna komponent kommer med andra ord att f\u00f6rebygga en utl\u00f6sande katastrof fr\u00e5n att ske samt lindra effekterna av en f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntad h\u00e4ndelse i syfte att skydda m\u00e4nniskors f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningsm\u00f6jligheter.\n\nVidare bed\u00f6mer Sida att samtliga medel f\u00f6r 2018 f\u00f6r projekten ska utbetalas omg\u00e5ende f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra planering och uppstart av projekten snarast.

St\u00f6d till Ukraina (5 MSEK) och ut\u00f6kat st\u00f6d till Sydsydan (fr\u00e5n en budget p\u00e5 4,5 MSEK till 13,5 MSEK) kommer att betalas ut efter att SRK inkommit med, och Sida godk\u00e4nt, till\u00e4ggsans\u00f6kningar f\u00f6r dessa kontexter. \n\nSRK \u00e4r en del av internationella r\u00f6dakors- och r\u00f6dahalvm\u00e5ner\u00f6relsen som best\u00e5r av 190 nationella r\u00f6dakors- och r\u00f6dahalvm\u00e5nef\u00f6reningar, Internationella r\u00f6dakors- och r\u00f6dahalvm\u00e5nefederationen (IFRC) och Internationella r\u00f6dakorskommitt\u00e9n (ICRC). Sida ger st\u00f6d till internationella r\u00f6dakors- och r\u00f6dahalvm\u00e5ner\u00f6relsen via tv\u00e5 kanaler: ICRC och SRK. SRK vidaref\u00f6rmedlar st\u00f6rre delen av Sidas st\u00f6d till nationella f\u00f6reningar, IFRC och ICRC och arbetar i l\u00e5ngsiktigt partnerskap med fjorton l\u00e4nder: Kamerun, DR Kongo, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Irak, Palestina, Syrien, Jemen och Ukraina. \n\nSRKs strategiska samarbete med partners inom r\u00f6relsen - med andra nationella f\u00f6reningar, IFRC och ICRC - \u00e4r centralt och ger SRK m\u00f6jlighet att arbeta b\u00e5de p\u00e5 global och lokal niv\u00e5. SRK bed\u00f6ms d\u00e4rut\u00f6ver ha system, kompetens och kapacitet att st\u00e4rka den lokala kapaciteten hos nationella f\u00f6reningar att f\u00f6rutse och f\u00f6rebygga katastrofer och bidra till \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning samt att bidra med snabbt humanit\u00e4rt st\u00f6d vid pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna kriser. SRK har haft sv\u00e5rt att p\u00e5visa den humanit\u00e4ra relevansen i de Sida-finansierade projekten d\u00e5 de ofta r\u00f6r sig i gr\u00e4nslandet mellan det humanit\u00e4ra och l\u00e5ngsiktig utveckling. SRKs nya humanit\u00e4ra strategi 2016-2019 l\u00e4gger dock ett st\u00f6rre fokus p\u00e5 humanit\u00e4ra insatser och denna nya strategi speglas i SRKs ans\u00f6kan om medel fr\u00e5n Sida 2017-2019. Ett flertal projekt som riktar sig mot l\u00e5ngsiktig utveckling har tagits bort i ans\u00f6kan och nya projekt med ett tydligare humanit\u00e4rt fokus har inkluderats, s\u00e5som Jemen och Kamerun (projekt som riktar sig till CAR flyktingar). Det kommer att vara viktigt att f\u00f6lja upp denna inriktning mot en st\u00e4rkt humanit\u00e4ra relevans f\u00f6r Sida-finansierade projekt.\n\nPlanerat st\u00f6d f\u00f6r 2017 innefattar l\u00e5ngsiktiga projekt inom olika verksamheter s\u00e5som h\u00e4lsa, katastroff\u00f6rebyggande, resiliens, sanitet, organisationsutveckling, volont\u00e4rutveckling samt planering, uppf\u00f6ljning, utv\u00e4rdering och resultat (PMER). St\u00f6det innefattar \u00e4ven regionalt st\u00f6d till IFRC:s olika kluster- och regionkontor i Afrika, Asien och MENA. Det tematiska- och kapacitetsh\u00f6jande st\u00f6det kommer 2017 fokusera p\u00e5 katastrofreducering, volont\u00e4rverksamhet i konflikt och katastrof, vatten och sanitet, h\u00e4lsa, samt gender och m\u00e5ngfald. Genom st\u00f6d i form av Sidas snabbinsats-mekanism - Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) - kommer SRK \u00e4ven kunna svara p\u00e5 hastigt uppkomna eller eskalerande katastrofer. \n\nProgramf\u00f6rslaget f\u00f6r 2017 inneh\u00e5ller:\nV\u00c4ST- OCH CENTRALAFRIKA REGIONALT ST\u00d6D: 1,3 MSEK\nKAMERUN: 2 MSEK\nDR KONGO: 5 MSEK\n\u00d6ST- OCH S\u00d6DRA AFRIKA REGIONALT ST\u00d6D: 2,1 MSEK\n\u00d6STAFRIKA CLUSTER (Nairobi): 2,5 MSEK\nSOMALIA: 4 MSEK \nSYDSUDAN: 13,5 MSEK\nSUDAN: 4 MSEK\nASIEN PACIFIC REGIONALT ST\u00d6D: 5,8 MSEK\nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nBANGLADESH: 6 MSEK\nNORDKOREA: 4,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \nMENA REGIONALT ST\u00d6D: 4,3 MSEK\nIRAK: 7 MSEK\nPALESTINA: 3 MSEK\nSYRIEN inklusive Libanon och Jordanien: 30 MSEK \nYEMEN: 4,5 MSEK\nUKRAINA: 5 MSEK\nKAPACITET- OCH METODST\u00d6D: 7,9 MSEK \nRRM-ST\u00d6D: 40 MSEK\nST\u00d6D TILL IFRC DREF: 500 000 SEK \nS\u00c4RSKILDA INSATSER/ICRC DELEGATER: 3,6 MSEK\n\nProgramf\u00f6rslaget f\u00f6r 2018 inneh\u00e5ller:\nDR KONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nProgramf\u00f6rslaget f\u00f6r 2019 inneh\u00e5ller:\nDR KONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nUtav Sidas initiala st\u00f6d f\u00f6r 2017 p\u00e5 totalt 167,5 MSEK vidaref\u00f6rmedlas ca 61,2 % (102,5 MSEK) till IFRC och ca 2,6 % till ICRC (4,5 MSEK).

The program covers the period 2017-2019 and the total budget for the program is SEK 35 400 000. LPI applying for support from Sida / Embassy in Nairobi for the program of which Sweden is funding 44% of the total budget 80 356 743 SEK. LPI has applied for EU funding through their call for proposals that are taking place during March 2017. LPI is applying for funding together with the Somali partner Somali Peace Line (SPL). LPI is currently investigating other potential donors. LPI has adjusted the current planning for 2017 to fit with the proposed support from Sida (and EU funds for CRM Phase II). The program is currently underfunded by 26%.The proposal also includes an integrated component of emergency aid to the ongoing and severe drought that hit the country in 2016 and continues to pose a threat in 2017. According to LPI, this response, with activities such as the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, job creation efforts, health nutritional packages, cholera prevention, hygiene training, food ration and the distribution of food parcels, knowledge about basic health program and services, strengthening social cohesion etc., constitutes a prerequisite to conduct the comprehensive peace building work in the areas that are the hardest hit by the drought. This initiative will run for three months and be reported separately (narrative, financial) in the first half-year reporting. LPI will forward 5,4MSEK to ZamZam Foundation (ZZF) for implementation of their drought response between April to June 2017. A separate reporting for the Three month emergency response is expected in August 2017. The audit of the funds to the emergency response will be covered in the annual audit.  The proposal builds upon the positive results from the program Conflict Transformation (2013-2016; extended to Feb 2017), namely;- Reduction in violent clashes and addressing intra and inter-clan conflicts across 5 regions of south central Somalia;- Peace agreements reached;- Women's increased inclusion in peacebuilding processes;- LPI\u2019s civil society partners demonstrated increased peacebuilding capacity;- Analysis and lessons on the importance of bottom-up peacebuilding and community engagement in statebuilding and the need for inclusive peace processes that engage a wide range of stakeholders across political divides, have been fed directly into key policy arenas at local, national and international levels. LPI has also contributed to regional debates on humanitarian conflict sensitivity.The overall objective of the program is to contribute to stability and peace in Somalia by supporting reconciliation processes which address the causes of grievance and conflict at the local level, reinforced by dedicated policy actors which promotes peace frameworks and state-building efforts.",

        "description": "Life & Peace Institute has developed a proposal for the program 'Multi-Level Conflict Transformation in South Central Somalia'. The program covers the period 2017-2019 and the total budget for the program is SEK 35 400 000. LPI applying for support from Sida / Embassy in Nairobi for the program of which Sweden is funding 44% of the total budget 80 356 743 SEK. LPI has applied for EU funding through their call for proposals that are taking place during March 2017. LPI is applying for funding together with the Somali partner Somali Peace Line (SPL). LPI is currently investigating other potential donors. LPI has adjusted the current planning for 2017 to fit with the proposed support from Sida (and EU funds for CRM Phase II). The program is currently underfunded by 26%.The proposal also includes an integrated component of emergency aid to the ongoing and severe drought that hit the country in 2016 and continues to pose a threat in 2017. According to LPI, this response, with activities such as the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, job creation efforts, health nutritional packages, cholera prevention, hygiene training, food ration and the distribution of food parcels, knowledge about basic health program and services, strengthening social cohesion etc., constitutes a prerequisite to conduct the comprehensive peace building work in the areas that are the hardest hit by the drought. This initiative will run for three months and be reported separately (narrative, financial) in the first half-year reporting. LPI will forward 5,4MSEK to ZamZam Foundation (ZZF) for implementation of their drought response between April to June 2017. A separate reporting for the Three month emergency response is expected in August 2017. The audit of the funds to the emergency response will be covered in the annual audit.  The proposal builds upon the positive results from the program Conflict Transformation (2013-2016; extended to Feb 2017), namely;- Reduction in violent clashes and addressing intra and inter-clan conflicts across 5 regions of south central Somalia;- Peace agreements reached;- Women's increased inclusion in peacebuilding processes;- LPI\u2019s civil society partners demonstrated increased peacebuilding capacity;- Analysis and lessons on the importance of bottom-up peacebuilding and community engagement in statebuilding and the need for inclusive peace processes that engage a wide range of stakeholders across political divides, have been fed directly into key policy arenas at local, national and international levels. LPI has also contributed to regional debates on humanitarian conflict sensitivity.The overall objective of the program is to contribute to stability and peace in Somalia by supporting reconciliation processes which address the causes of grievance and conflict at the local level, reinforced by dedicated policy actors which promotes peace frameworks and state-building efforts.",

V\u00e5ldsam extremism utg\u00f6r ocks\u00e5 en komplex utmaning f\u00f6r landet och den omgivande regionen. Problemet har ocks\u00e5 globala implikationer. Vidare p\u00e5verkas Somalia av klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka. 2,3 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor har os\u00e4ker livsmedelsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning och \u00f6ver en miljon \u00e4r internflyktingar. Av en befolkning p\u00e5 ca 12 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor uppskattas drygt 70 % vara fattiga och drygt 40 % leva i extrem fattigdom.

Kvinnor saknar dessutom tillg\u00e5ng till r\u00e4ttvisa som kan skydda deras r\u00e4ttigheter och tillvarata deras intressen. Bristen p\u00e5 ett formellt och effektivt r\u00e4ttssystem i de flesta delar av landet har lett till omfattande straffrihet. 2017 var Somalia rankat som det mest korrupta landet i v\u00e4rlden enligt Transparency International. \n\nSamtidigt har en relativt fredlig politisk process f\u00f6r \u00e5teruppbyggnad av staten och dess institutioner inletts. Ett \u00f6kande internationellt st\u00f6d de senaste \u00e5ren har bidragit till flera viktiga framsteg, exempelvis genomf\u00f6randet av indirekta parlamentsval under h\u00f6sten 2016, \u00f6kad politisk representation av kvinnor och presidentval i februari 2017 som ledde till ett fredligt maktskifte. \n\nMPTF etablerades 2015 med Sverige som en av de f\u00f6rsta givarna.

Som fondadministrat\u00f6r, ansvarar UNDP f\u00f6r rapportering till givarna. Avst\u00e4mningar sker i olika styrkomitteer p\u00e5 flera niv\u00e5er (givarsamordning tillsammans med Somalias regering samt p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5) inom ramen f\u00f6r den etablerade samordningstrukturen (Somalia Development and Recontruction Facility- SDRF).  \n\nInom omr\u00e5det reproduktiv-, m\u00f6dra- och barnh\u00e4lsa och r\u00e4ttigheter kommer 140 MSEK \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkas till UNFPA:s landprogram f\u00f6r Somalia. (F\u00f6r f\u00f6rdjupad bed\u00f6mning av UNFPA som strategisk parter i Somalia och av UNFPA:s landprogram 2018-2020, se beslut 28/2017, daterat 2017-06-22.) \n\nDessutom avses 60 MSEK \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkas till det s\u00e5 kallade \"Enablers programme\" som innefattar st\u00f6d till FNs riskhandteringsenhet, till avdelningen f\u00f6r s\u00e4kerhet och trygghet, samt till Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO) vilket bed\u00f6mds vara avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r alla utvecklingsinsatser i Somalia. \n\nAvtalsutkastet f\u00f6ljer den mellan UNDP och Sida \u00f6verenskomna mallen f\u00f6r den nu g\u00e4llande samarbetsformen.

Trots m\u00e5nga och allvarliga risker, \u00e4r det Sidas bed\u00f6mning att uppsatta m\u00e5l kommer att n\u00e5s till en rimlig grad om FN, deltagande givare och somaliska akt\u00f6rer samarbetar f\u00f6r att minska dessa risker. Sverige och andra givare kommer att spela en viktig roll i detta avseende.\n\nDet ska till\u00e4ggas att MPTF inte enbart utg\u00f6r en finansieringsmekanism, utan fungerar \u00e4ven som en plattform f\u00f6r givarkoordinering i bredare bem\u00e4rkelse och inbegriper de st\u00f6rsta givarna som EU, UK, USA, NO, DE, och DK.

Samtidigt b\u00f6rjar EU och UK delvis initiera nya bilaterala program inom specifika omr\u00e5den, medan andra givare s\u00e5som DE kommer att ut\u00f6ka sitt st\u00f6d till MPTF.",

Medel utg\u00e5r s\u00e5ledes fr\u00e5n Sida, till UNDP som fondadministrat\u00f6r, och vidaref\u00f6rmedlas d\u00e4refter  till respektive ledande FN organ som ansvarar f\u00f6r programmets genomf\u00f6rande och uppf\u00f6ljning. Som fondadministrat\u00f6r, ansvarar UNDP f\u00f6r rapportering till givarna. Avst\u00e4mningar sker i olika styrkomitteer p\u00e5 flera niv\u00e5er (givarsamordning tillsammans med Somalias regering samt p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5) inom ramen f\u00f6r den etablerade samordningstrukturen (Somalia Development and Recontruction Facility- SDRF).  \n\nInom omr\u00e5det reproduktiv-, m\u00f6dra- och barnh\u00e4lsa och r\u00e4ttigheter kommer 140 MSEK \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkas till UNFPA:s landprogram f\u00f6r Somalia. (F\u00f6r f\u00f6rdjupad bed\u00f6mning av UNFPA som strategisk parter i Somalia och av UNFPA:s landprogram 2018-2020, se beslut 28/2017, daterat 2017-06-22.) \n\nDessutom avses 60 MSEK \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkas till det s\u00e5 kallade \"Enablers programme\" som innefattar st\u00f6d till FNs riskhandteringsenhet, till avdelningen f\u00f6r s\u00e4kerhet och trygghet, samt till Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO) vilket bed\u00f6mds vara avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r alla utvecklingsinsatser i Somalia. \n\nAvtalsutkastet f\u00f6ljer den mellan UNDP och Sida \u00f6verenskomna mallen f\u00f6r den nu g\u00e4llande samarbetsformen. Det nya standardavtalet (Standard Administrative Arrangement, SAA)  kommer att anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att reglera Sveriges bidrag till fonden. Avtalet kommer att undertecknas av Sida och av UNDP som administrativ agent. En uppdragsbeskrivningen f\u00f6r MPTF samt ett Memorandum of Understanding mellan alla genomf\u00f6randeparter \u00e4r bilagda (utkast). Insatshanteringsregelns krav f\u00f6r avtal f\u00f6r SAA f\u00f6r FNs finansieringsf\u00f6nster \u00e4r uppfyllda. Vidare har ett Memorandum of Agreement ing\u00e5tts mellan FSG och UNDP som administrativ agent. \n\nDe juridiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r att kunna l\u00e4mna st\u00f6d \u00e4ven till det nationella f\u00f6nstret diskuteras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvrande  mellan Sida/JUR och FN i New York. Om och n\u00e4r dessa diskusioner \u00e4r avslutade kan ett eventuellt st\u00f6d till det nationella f\u00f6nstret bli f\u00f6rem\u00e5l f\u00f6r ett separat till\u00e4ggsbeslut.\n\nMPTF harmoniserar betydande resurser som kanaliseras inom FN i Somalia och bidrar d\u00e4rmed till ett koordinerat internationellt st\u00f6d till Somalia. Trots m\u00e5nga och allvarliga risker, \u00e4r det Sidas bed\u00f6mning att uppsatta m\u00e5l kommer att n\u00e5s till en rimlig grad om FN, deltagande givare och somaliska akt\u00f6rer samarbetar f\u00f6r att minska dessa risker. Sverige och andra givare kommer att spela en viktig roll i detta avseende.\n\nDet ska till\u00e4ggas att MPTF inte enbart utg\u00f6r en finansieringsmekanism, utan fungerar \u00e4ven som en plattform f\u00f6r givarkoordinering i bredare bem\u00e4rkelse och inbegriper de st\u00f6rsta givarna som EU, UK, USA, NO, DE, och DK. Fonden \u00e4r d\u00e4rmed ett viktigt och centralt instrument f\u00f6r det internationella givarsamfundet och den somaliska regeringen i deras samarbete f\u00f6r att f\u00f6rverkliga de \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5len om fred och utveckling i Somalia. Samtidigt b\u00f6rjar EU och UK delvis initiera nya bilaterala program inom specifika omr\u00e5den, medan andra givare s\u00e5som DE kommer att ut\u00f6ka sitt st\u00f6d till MPTF.",

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster.

Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur.

AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker.

Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning.

Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn.

Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

The programme is a follow-up phase of the \"IMS-Fojo Somalia Programme 2014-2018\" which amounted to a total figure of 57 MSEK.\n\nIn order to avoid an activity gap between the first and second phase, IMS/Fojo decided to start implementing the programme from 1st of January 2019 with temporary funding from IMS headquarter. This was done with the aspiration of Swedish funding for the second phase coming through during spring 2019.

        "description": "Long-running conflict has destroyed the infrastructure of the Somali state and the country has one of the worst health indicators in the world. The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proj\nect's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinic?s personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

The additional funding supports the Somaliland Ministry of Health efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic health consequences\n for 3 months. To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three outputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Loc\nal health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increased capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Som\nali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developing strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child hea\nlth. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health outcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has b\neen evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide quality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the plann\ning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer than in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora expe\nrts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also implements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 un\ntil August 2020. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

The expert has held a key position in the team in charge of drafting the strategy for reconciliation. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland has supported the projec\nt during the years 2018-2020. The first phase of the project saw the development of a nation-wide National Reconciliation Framework based on consultations with state and civil society actors. The second phase supported MoIFAR in the implementation of the n\national reconciliation process while advancing the participation of women and youth in the process. The third phase of the project will ensure that the activities started in the second phase will continue without breaks. Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Fin\nland will suppor the project with 204 233 Euros. The project will be implemented over a period of 5 months in 2020-2021.",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

The project is executed by the Finland-Somalia Association (FSA) with partner NGO SAHDA and th\ne Jubaland Ministry of Health. The project is a continuation of the Maternal and Child Health Services Clinic ?project that the FSA has ran since 2011 in Afmadow town. Based on an agreement with the Jubaland Ministry of Health the FSA has been asked to swi\ntch its foces to more remote villages through a mobile clinic. The mobile clinic is to start its operations in 2018 depending on permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland. With this application the project plan is to continue the Mobile He\nalth Clinic through 2019-2020 a total of three years.The main development problem that the project aims to solve is the poor access to preventive and basic health care in the Afmadow area in Jubaland Somalia. The project aims to take health services close \nto remote communities where it is difficult to get access to basic healthcare and where travelling is a challenge. By curing and providing basic health services in remote locations the project contrib-utes to creating a healthier community and society with\n people who are able to work for their own livelihoods. In this context the project contributes significantly to achieving the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals. The development impact that the project strives for is to increase the wellbeing of the commu\nnities in the project area and to decrease the number of diseases and illnesses.The mobile clinic concept includes three core outputs:1. Supporting existing healthcare by providing health services in suburbs nearby villages and towns2. Providing supportive\n services in first aid family reproductive services and interventions reducing infectious diseases in the target villages3. Reducing travelling for health services from the towns as well as building the competence of the local community in health particula\nrly by giving tools and knowledge to local midwives.",

        "description": "1. Project: 12091 Improving employment and livelihood opportunities for Somali and   youth through TVET and business skills development    2. Project area and Country: Hargeisa, Somaliland3. Project justification: Somaliland is one of the poorest nations i\nn the world. About 60% of Somalilanders are youth aged 15-35 years old; among those 40% are aged 15-29. The overall adult literacy rate across Somaliland is of 45.3% (50.2% among men and 40.2 among women). The unemployment rate in Somaliland among youth ag\ned 14-29 is 67%, one of the highest rate in the world, with women experiencing higher unemployment rate at 74% than men at 61%. The majority of the employment is classified as vulnerable employment with low wages, low level of social security, poor working\n conditions, and limited worker rights, with women experiencing more vulnerability than men do. Poor to no level of education leaves the vast majority of youth with little opportunity to access the labour market, rendering them without hope and perspective\n. 4. The main objective and the expected results:The project aims to contribute to sustainable and profitable employment and self-employment opportunities for male and female youth from IDPs, host communities and returnees in Hargeisa of Somaliland. The ai\nm is going to be achieved by following FCA?s thematic pillars of right to livelihood (R2L) and right to quality education (R2QE). FCA intends to pilot the integrated approach of Linking Learning to Earning (LL2E) aimed at providing both male and female you\nth with quality and market driven TVET trainings, which are informed by labor market assessment, combined with 1) career guidance and counselling, 2) close collaboration with private sector for market driven curriculum development, and provision of interns\nhip, apprenticeship and job placement, 3) entrepreneurship and business development, and 4) effective collaboration with the government institutions and private sector to promote TVET, employability and business opportunities.  Right-holders/beneficiaries:\n 60 TVET learners and 410 male and female secondary school learners. 5. Duty bearers: Local government agencies, parents, caregivers, community leaders and traditional and religious elders, and private sector. 6. Implementing partner: FCA Somalia Country P\nrogramme",

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Cares Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results show\n that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health care\n for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that \neventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneousl\ny invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the \ntelephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proje\nct's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinics personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB)  especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: d\nisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat  fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is th\ne low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case detect\nion rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and prisone\nrs)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of Soma\nliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of tu\nberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease stigm\na/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tubercul\nosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

The response will provide comprehensive WASH services in  Eyl district, saving lives by meeting Sphere standards/Somalia WASH Cluster Strategic Operational Framework through gender-sensitive services, contributing to overall health and disease prevention of IDP and rural communities. The project targets floods, cyclone and conflict affected populations (Internally displaced persons, Pastoralists communities and host communities.)  The project is designed to meet the needs of PAWAN cyclone affected populations in Eyl district of Nugaal region, Puntland Somalia. The project aims to reach 15,000 (3,000men, 3,750 women, 3,750 boys and 4,500 girls)\nThe WASH response will reduce health risks through hygiene promotion campaigns in communities while using participatory approaches. Responses will prioritize needs of women, girls and vulnerable people, include environmental safeguards to prevent degradation from humanitarian operations and afford affected people dignity and choice through Cash and Vouchers Assistance (CVA). A total 1500 women and girls will be supported through restricted CVA for hygiene/dignity items ensuring that women and girls can access preferred items for MHM and incontinence. Gender-segregated latrines (120 with locks and hand washing facilities) will be constructed and will include units accessible for people with disabilities limiting open defecation. Immediate water access will be ensured through durable solutions such as rehabilitation  and  construction and expansion of 2 water supply and improved subsurface dams/ 5 berkards are put in place. Gender-balanced WASH committees(2) will be supported to maintain facilities. In regard t improving protection environment of vulnerable groups 885 solar lamps will be distributed to enhance access to facilities\nDelivery of services will  further prioritize inclusion, participation of and accountability to affected populations. Integrated response will provide holistic aid that can respond rapidly to emerging needs, and this multi-year response will increase communities\u2019 resilience to future shocks. The project will strengthen capacities through training of water committees, hygiene promoters and general hygiene awareness campaigns including environmental sanitation to influence behaviour change and achieve adoption of appropriate hygiene and sanitation practices. \nThe project will make deliberate effort to maintain a protective environment throughout its interventions so that girls and women in particular are not exposed to harm such as sexual and gender-based violence while accessing WASH services. Further, gender equity will be observed while implementing all project activities. Men, women, Boys and Girls will be treated equally with their different needs being targeted and support provided accordingly. Women will be fronted to participate in decision making structures like the community WASH committees where they will be involved in project monitoring efforts.\nNCA will work closely with the existing local administration and community structures such as religious leaders, clan and community elders, minorities\u2019 women group and youth networks, men, women, girls and boys from IDPs community to accommodate the most vulnerable communities and will ensure inclusiveness, accountability and transparency.",

        "description": "In Lower Juba region and across Somalia, there are multiple threats to the health and resilience of the population due to inadequate WASH facilities. For water supply, Afmadow population is dependent on a mix of unprotected surface water sources and protected groundwater sources. Surface water sources are seasonal and usually contaminated, while protected groundwater supplies are either difficult to access to due to distance and/or not affordable due the high costs of extraction and the dominance of private sector entrepreneurs in their operation, often resulting in rates that the lower income communities cannot afford to access a minimum quantity of water per person per day (Sphere).\nIn this context, ARC will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1) Rehabilitation and/or extension of 5 existing water infrastructures to provide reliable and sustained access to safe water based on identified strategic community water points to flood affected communities in Afmadow district. (2) Establishment of 5 gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women participation in WASH projects. (3) Installation of new and/or rehabilitation of 600 sanitation facilities that are lockable from inside, gender segregated, with hand washing facilities, disaster sensitive with appropriate disaster mitigation features designs. As part of ensuring protection mainstreaming, ARC will install solar light near communal sanitation facilities or if this is not feasible will provide with individual household\u2019s solar lamp/torch. (4) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution to enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness and enable good practices. Significant amount of the above proposed WASH activities will be implemented through Market Based Programming (MBP) approach as to strengthen local markets. \n The proposed WASH project will complement set of emergency Health, Protection and livelihood interventions currently ongoing in the targeted areas of Afmadow district through other funding to ensure a comprehensive approach to reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with diseases and hazards resulting from deficient sanitation conditions, the lack of access to safe water and low level of good hygiene practices. ARC\u2019s WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. Approximately 24,000 people (4,000 households) will benefit from this intervention. All ARC WASH programs are community led, and leverage stakeholder cooperation to ensure safe, equitable, and dignified access to WASH services for all. Under Health sector, ARC is supporting one MCH (Bosnia) in Dhobley and would start Outreach health services in Afmadow town targeting IDP sites with vulnerable individuals having difficult access to basic lifesaving health services. ARC would also provide un-conditional cash transfer to vulnerable groups in Dhobley for 3 months aiming to improve food security situation as well as the nutrition indicators. ARC\u2019s integrated approach combining the WASH intervention with health and nutrition components ensures greater impact in the area of operation. Adequate WASH improves the overall public health indicators, including the lower incidence of communicable diseases, reduced mother and child morbidity and stronger effects of nutrition interventions as a result of prevention of loss of valuable nutrients from diarrheal diseases.",

PAH, NoFYL and HINNA will implement a multi cluster intervention aiming at 1) CCCM: improving the coordination and information management at site level 2) WASH: addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs in this field 3) PROTECTION: mainstreaming protection through (a) preventing and response to eviction, including monitoring threats of evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant cluster to mobilize support for advocacy (b) To advocacy and campaigns that aim to ensure lawful eviction processes (c) Capacity development of settlement managers, local authorities in the field of housing, land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). 4) SHELTER: improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and construction of Transitional shelters.\nActivities will be implemented by PAH, NoFYL and HINNA in 2 districts (Kaxda and Deynile) of Banadir region. Activities will target the most undeserved areas of these districts that host mostly newly displaced IDPs due to drought and conflicts. Approximately 17,400 people (3,283 men, 6505 Boys, 9,710 girls and 4,886 women) including 3658 people with disability will directly benefit from this intervention. It will also benefit an entire community working in targeted IDP sites, including local authorities, clusters and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach and synergies enable the partners to concentrate services and expertise within the same location and same population, leading to a greater impact.\n\nMoreover, PAH acts as WASH Cluster co-lead at national cluster level, NoFYL is part of SRCs and member of CCCM and protection cluster, while HINNA is a member of shelter cluster in Banadir region. This allows to ensure a great capacity for project implementation and a strong understanding of the cluster strategy. Each partner will directly implement activities of their specialization sector. The coordination among partners will be done throughout an entire implementation process to ensure synergies and combine services delivery for all sectors. The partners will jointly conduct periodic monitoring activities to assess implementation of the project, collect feedback from beneficiaries and adjust implementation accordingly if needed. This will be done through harmonized tools that will be developed during the project kick-off meeting. Furthermore, NoFYL, while  providing protection services to IDPs, will also ensure that protection is mainstreamed throughout WASH activities conducted by PAH  as well as Shelter activities conducted by HINNA,  by providing relevant training and ensuring strong coordination.",

The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge.

Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

        "description": "As part of the global capacity support to the FGS in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) has received a request from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) to provide two 350 KVA generators in strengthening the functioning of the De Martino and Benadir Hospitals and the National Testing Laboratory. The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.",

        "description": "Displacement, cramped living conditions and other related stressors following flooding all serve to exacerbate tensions and increase violence in the home and in communities, with women and girls most at risk. With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries. Approximately 50 (20 girls and women) will be engaged in GBV safety audit and action planning in their communities. 4,000 (1,220girls,1,260 women, 800 boys and 720 men) will be reached through door to door community outreach and over 25,000 reached through GBV radio advocacy and awareness creation. 450 dignity kits and 250 emergency support kits and 2000 sanitary kits will be distributed. Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management.

        "description": "In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

        "description": "The project aims at reducing risks and fatalities posed by explosive ordnance(EO) in Afgooye district, Lower Shebelle Region, and Danyiile, Banadir region especially the returnees, internally displaced persons, and host communities affected by floods by the provision of explosive ordinances risk education (EORE) to the \u201cmost at-risk population. \n\nThe project will focus to strengthen the capacity of communities to live safely in areas contaminated by past and ongoing conflicts. Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region. There were more than 5 accidents with fatalities and casualties in the Danyiile district alone this year which includes children and persons with no knowledge of Explosive ordinances.\n\nIn Afgooye about 191,143 persons standing as 100% of the population severity level no 3 described as degrading which puts them highly in need of protection against the explosive substances. Of these 56,000 are IDPs from the floods and other natural calamities while 135,431 are host communities according to the data recently shared by the protection cluster on HNO.\n\nExplosive ordinances contamination presents a barrier to development, and encumber livelihood activities particularly it affected IDPs, returnees, animal herders, and the rural poor families.",

        "description": "Based on the analysis of the current flood situation in the target locations, NoFYL intends to extend its protection monitoring programme to contribute towards enhancing protection, increasing safety and promoting dignity of conflict-affected women, men, girls and boys, in Kismayo and Balcad. These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.     Increased availability of legal services for post flood HLP issues.\n\nNoFYL is currently an SPMS partner leading data collections in Kismayo, Afgoye and Mogadishu (Deynille amp Kaxda districts).",

The villages are home to pastoralists and agrarian communities.  Other villages that are affected by the floods include Athale, Haji Ali, Mahaday, Sabuni, Congo, Grasweyn and Adow uul. According to OCHA updates 1 on Deyr Season Floods Update, as of 4 November 2020, the flood in Jowhar affected 27,364 person living in Jowhar .The update also reported that on 3rd and 4th November 2020, flash floods cut the road linking Jowhar to Mogadishu at a location 10 km south of Jowhar.  The floods also affected the road to the airport. On 12th and 13th October 2020, heavy rains triggered flash floods in the riverine villages affecting about 3,600 people.  The Jowhar authorities reported that two children drowned as the result of the flash floods.The floods caused various impact to the WASH facilities the findings indicate that only less than 10% of the total affected population have access to safe water drinking water. Most of the infrastructure such as latrines have submerged and destroyed as the result of the floods. Sanitation is a serious issue due to the inadequate number of latrines in comparison to the population in need and many people are practice open defecation due to lack of sufficient latrines against the population. Lack of adequate and safe sanitation puts women, girls and at risk of physical violence and sexual assault as they relieve themselves in the open field.The water have been contaminated and not fit for human consumption leading to potential outbreaks of water-borne diseases and acute water diarrhea.Therefore, in order to fill the gaps Islamic relief Somalia with funding from OCHA is planning to fill the gaps by rehabilitating of 5 shallow wells, two 2 boreholes and construction of 200 flood latrines.The project aims to tackle the effects emanating from the floods by providing emergency WASH services in Jowhar district, Somalia. The intervention is in line with the WASH strategy. It will also link to recovery and resilience building of the communities by rehabilitating WASH infrastructure that will assist 16,500 direct beneficiaries affected by Hagaa floods in Jowhar .The project will install solar power systems to the two (02) boreholes that are to be  rehabilitated  in jowhar depending on the needs while the rehabilitation of five (05) shallow wells will be undertaken at Mahaday,gumeysta,congo,marerey and cali warabey. The shallow wells will be rehabilitated, protected and upgrading including the installation of Two (2) boreholes that will be rehabilitated will be connected to water piping system including construction of four (4) water kiosk from the main borehole, gender balanced water management committees will be formed and trained. Islamic Relief Somalia will provide emergency water trucking to 4,000 beneficiaries in the rural areas of Jowhar district Each beneficiary will receive water in accordance with sphere standard of (7.5 liters/ per person per day). Water through tricks will be delivered on daily through blanket system which ensured beneficiaries know the quantity and where water should be collected.The displaced population in Jowhar are at risk of contracting malaria, acute bloody or watery diarrhoea, measles and other sanitation related diseases, The project will construct 200 emergency pit latrines to reduce AWD cases and improve the sanitation services. The latrines will be designed in line with the protection guidelines and segregated according to the sex. 20 latrines will be designed to meet the special requirements of people with disability.The project will construct and install 10 COVID-19 hand washing stations in order to  prevent COVID-19.The IDPs and the host communities will benefit from hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and production of IEC materials.1500 HHs will receive hygiene kits.",

The floods have displaced in Wanlaweyn alone more than 82,000 people, inundated homes, wells and schools and destroyed large swathes of farmland and crops The heavy deyr rains ave caused massive population displacement, damaged housing, property, infrastructure and farm lands in riverine areas in southern Somalia. WASH Cluster has reported critical gaps in Balcad, Marka and Wanlaweyn where no WASH assistance has been received despite high risk levels for AWD.\nThe main aim of this project is to provide lifesaving WASH services to most vulnerable and underserved communities living in floods affected areas in Wanlaweyn district of Lower Shabelle Region. A total of 17,000 flood affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally throughout the project period.\n\nSOYDA in collaboration with the local authority, partnership with main water vendors in rural villages in Wanlaweyn district, will provide emergency water voucher to the 6,400 (1408 men, 1,536 women, 1,728 boys and 1,728 girls) targeted beneficiaries including people with disabilities and marginalized communities in the targeted IDP camps, which they can redeem for water at the specified water vendors (water trucks). The action also includes to hire water truck of a capacity of 6,000 liters of safe water to the targeted locations. Each voucher can be used to redeem specified quantity of safe water of 7.5 liters per person per day for a period of 30 days. The project will build the capacity of 1q WASH Committees (composing 4 men and 3 women per Committee) shared equally men and women on operation and maintenance of developed water infrastructures shall be throughout the project implementation period, to ensure the sustainability of the developed water facilities after the project is faced out. SOYDA will make sure that men, women, girls and boys including people with disabilities and marginalized community have equal access to the rehabilitated/constructed WASH services. SOYDA will upgrade/rehabilitate two boreholes equipped with hybrid to improve its water quality and reduce its running cost, in order to receive the community their water needs at an affordable cost. SOYDA will replace the engine powered boreholes in to hybrid system and construct 8 water kiosks nearer to the IDP settlements supplied water through piping network to avoid the risk of rape against women and girls in Wanlaweyn district. The project will provide reliable and sustainable access to environmental sanitation through construction of 100 IDP latrines in Wanlaweyn district. The latrines will be gender separated and flood proof with lockable doors and hand washing basins. construction of latrines will be implemented through market-based programming. \n\nSOYDA will distribute 80 sanitation sets to 10 IDP camps, in order to improve the environmental sanitation of the targeted locations. The aim of the sanitation sets distribution is to carry out clean-up campaigns, in order to reduce the spread of AWD/cholera diseases and to improve the environmental sanitation of the target locations. SOYDA will conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns focusing hand washing with soap practices to 17,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, health facilities, and nutrition centers. SOYDA will also train 30 Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) shared equally men and women, selected from the target communities and IDPs, so that in their turn they can educate the entire population to change their behaviors. 1600 HP kits will be distributed to the most vulnerable and underserved communities in the target locations",

The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement this intervention in 31 sites across Burao and Buhodle (16 sites in Burao and 15 sites in Buhodle). \n\nFEWS NET Post Deyr technical release projects that in Togdheer region of Somaliland that 181,000 people will be stressed IPC phase 2, 91,000 in crisis IPC phase 3 and 13,000 in emergency IPC phase 4 by June, 2020 if humanitarian assistance is not extended to the region. \n\nCamp coordination and camp management is a relatively new concept within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized on this concept. It is necessary to increase awareness on this technical concept and equip stakeholders with the relevant capacity to implement such interventions.",

WASH intervention will be complemented by PAH through the distribution of complete kits of hygiene, capacity building of water committees and community hygiene promotion through community outreach and awareness campaigns, addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs. ESNFI intervention will be complemented by HINNA by improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and emergency shelter kits.\n\nAt the initial stages of project implementation, the partners will organize an inception meeting with different actors with the support of the relevant cluster Coordinators. Rapid service mapping of actors will also be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervention areas and avoid duplication. NoFYL field teams shall actively participate in coordination mechanisms in Kaxda and Deynille to ensure other actors are updated on NoFYL plans in targeted districts to avoid overlap. This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI, CCCM, Protection, and WASH support and complement activities undertaken under other ongoing projects. NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation. The synergy between the 3 sectoral partners will ensure sound management of the program, greater impact, efficiency, and more cost-effective operations.

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

        "description": "Despite a favorable Deyr (October- December) rainy season, the lingering effects of the drought in 2018/2019, and flooding an estimated 1.3 million people in Somalia will be in Crisis (IPC Phase3) through mid-2020 without sustained humanitarian assistance. Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019. PDM also monitors expenditure patterns of the provided support and determines measures for corrective actions if there are deviations from objective.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is that the food security situation of 865 vulnerable households (5160 individuals) in mostly rural communities in Zeylac district of Somaliland is stabilized and communities are more resilient towards adverse conditions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers: a) unconditional and b) conditional cash transfers for improved access to food. The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

Of these,  200 HH are IDPs located in Abudwaq town. \nOutput 2 targets 1,632 HH (9794 people) in the protection and restoration of their livelihoods for increased food and income sources. Of these, 900 HH will benefit from animal treatment meant to restore approximately 27,000 livestock to better health. This intervention will improve the livestock economic value as well as the value of meat and milk for household consumption. 6,000 additional and emaciated livestock will receive animal feed concentrate for a month to help them recover their health and increase production. The project will install a solar-powered pumping system to pump water from the Dalsan village borehole to the elevated village water tank which will then use gravity to distribute to the village water kiosk and livestock watering troughs that were constructed by NAPAD with funding from German-FFO. Over 430 HH in Dalsan will benefit from climate and economic friendly source of water for their livestock estimated to be 12,960. To increase household access to nutritious food 100 women will be supported to diversify into small scale kitchen gardening of vegetables and fruits. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The farms will be designed to ensure that the least amount of water is utilized in agricultural production. Women from the Dalsan village will especially benefit from the proposed solar water pumping system that will provide water to irrigate the kitchen gardens. Inagabille households and livestock will get their water from NAPAD constructed, G-FFO funded elevated 60,000 litres tank and animal troughs. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The gardens will be designed to use low amounts of water in vegetable production.",

The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. World Vision Somalia (WV Som)  will work  with MOH to address the health and nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and persons living with physical disabilities in the 2 targeted districts. 1 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the unique needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated populations in  Burtinle district.  Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with SAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be  registered through SCOPE to access  TSFP that is supported by WFP. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the  SCs that World Vision propose to support in Burtinle  district.  At each of the 4  MCHs, WVI shall establish basic reproductive health care services aligned within the MISP framework, utilizing the ambulances to refer mothers with complications from the MCHs and PHUs to the hospitals. At each PHU WV shall build the capacity of the community midwives to provide basic reproductive health care services in remote hard to reach areas as a mitigation measure against preventable maternal morbidity and mortality. While engaging community volunteers, WV shall adopt Timed and targeted counselling (TTC) approach focusing on pre conception to the first 1000 days of a child\u2019s life also incorporating the Finish baby kit and Fortified rice and lentils (Vitameal) as a motivator for adoption of promoted health seeking practices among WCBA through enhancing access to Reproductive health care services, child health including Immunization ,IYCF and hygiene promotion care and care-giver led MUAC screening and referral . At 4 targeted MCHs and PHUs WV has an already established GBV care system with personnel already trained and necessary CMR supplies in place to respond to GBV cases.  World Vision will ensure that beneficiaries visiting the targeted facilities including beneficiaries served at the mobile sites access a comprehensive basic package of services .Towards health and nutrition promotion, World Vision will focus on NHHP, care-giver led MUAC screening that will be done at the project sites with the nutrition beneficiaries is linked with the food security and safety net interventions to enhance household food basket.",

It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.\nThe project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.\nSave the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.\nWe would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.",

        "title": "Providing Integrated Health and WASH services to marginalized and vulnerable IDP and Host communities in Burdhubo",
        "description": "Trocaire has been the main provider of Health services in Gedo since 1992, operating all main hospitals in northern Gedo in partnership with District Health Boards and, more recently, the Ministry of Health. This proposed intervention will provide integrated lifesaving Health and WASH services to 3,987 men, 3,767 women, 3,588 boys, and 3,404 girls from Burdhubo location in Garbaharey district. These will include approximately 7,373 IDPs, 7,373 host community members, and 730 individuals with different forms of disability. Trocaire will work closely with the government District Medical Officers, the Burdhubo District Health Board, the District Commissioner's office, other implementing partners and with coordination through the Health and WASH clusters. Coordination will be prioritized as it remains a key assumption of the project for effective and efficient delivery of integrated lifesaving assistance to vulnerable and marginalized populations in Burdhubo. Health interventions aim to provide primary and essential lifesaving services in an inclusive manner. With a few private health facilities in Burdhubo, the population remains under-served, with children, pregnant and lactating mothers facing unimaginable challenges as they walk long distances of up to 40 kilometres to access health services. Trocaire will therefore work with the above stakeholders to re-establish affordable, accessible, and inclusive health services to both vulnerable IDP and host communities. This will require minor rehabilitation of 1 static health facility- Burdhubo Health Centre, and equipment and management of 1 mobile outreach team that will access beneficiaries in 5 outreach sites. Waiting shades will be constructed in these five sites to ensure dignified assistance is provided in a safe, accessible environment. Health workers will be trained to handle different components of health activities including Clinical Management of Rape, immunizations, emergency trauma care, communicable disease treatment, TB screening and treatment etc. Specialized services, which require referral to nearby hospitals, will be facilitated. The Trocaire-managed health facility in Garbaharey town will be the main referral point, as it is equipped as a referral hospital.\nWASH services will complement health services through relations with the health outreach teams, working closely to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, as well as reducing cases of malnutrition. Preventive approaches will be utilized through 11 hygiene promotion sessions with community-based staff/ volunteers. Hand-washing practices will be promoted through distribution of 1,000 hygiene kits through restricted cash vouchers in collaboration with the WASH cluster hub, as well as other partners on the ground, if any. According to assessment data collected in early March 2020, about 90 percent of the population in Burdhubo use untreated and unsafe water from the river, which is also too far a distance for most of the HHs. Within this project, Trocaire will seek to construct one hybrid shallow well with water treatment encouraged at the household level to encourage uptake of safe and clean water. One representative Water-User Management Committees (WMCs) will be set up to manage the shallow wells created. 70 emergency latrines will be constructed and hand-washing facilities with soap installed. Hygiene promotion sessions will be held. Trocaire is discussing with other partners to ensure that once this project is operational there will be opportunities to continue implementing necessary services, and working closely with the local, regional and national stakeholders to ensure that they are well equipped to continue provision of these services, when time is right for Trocaire to exit.",

The fixed nutrition/health sites and mobile teams will provide at least 5 out of 9 BNSP components. This will allow ARC to treat  2,428 children with MAM and  816 children(6-59 months) with SAM, including 60 with medical complication treated by April 2021. ARC has PCA with UNICEF/WFP will provide all the supplies needed for treatment in-kind, Promote, enable and sustain behavior change related to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF-E), ARC started engaging UNICEF and WFP for proposed project supplies. ARC will implement family -led MUAC approach and train community health workers on IYCF -E, Capacity building on the revised IMAM guideline for 19 nutrition health staff and Improve reporting, monitoring and report regular reporting. All health/nutrition sites will report monthly statistical data through DHIS/ONA to the government, health and nutrition cluster\n\n\nThe nutrition situation in Hudun district continues to deteriorate further without humanitarian assistance. Post deyr 2019 FSNAU indicated that Sool region has high caseloads of acute malnourished children, with estimated caseloads of 26,900. From the total caseloads estimated, 4,300 were severely malnourished with higher risk of medical complications and death. To address this situation, ARC will improve access and provide nutrition services to children aged 0-59 months, Pregnant and Lactating Women with acute malnutrition through detection, treatment and referral of complicated cases to the stabilization centers. Priority activities will include: Training of Community Volunteers in identification/referral of malnutrition cases, and mothers trained in mother-led MUAC Provision of Outpatient Therapeutic Feeding for 3,244 children aged 6-59 months with SAM and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program for MAM and 5,418 PLWs. Community members including women of all age groups, men of all age groups, all the race and gender will be engaged to directly influence the project through the life-cycle of the project creating a platform to share information with recommendations that is used to further guide the program performance.",

Children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) will be referred to the TFSP, while those with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) will be referred to the OTP run by SUADO. Complicated cases of SAM will be treated in the stabilization centre (SC) in Jalalaqsi. Tracing of children that have defaulted from the SC programme will be established and carried out by the SC teams. Provision of therapeutic and supplementary feeding for malnourished children lt5 and PLW will be provided during the programme period. Children not progressing well under treatment will be visited at home for counselling for their mothers. \nMercy-USA will ensure that nutrition site will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will secure agreements with WFP and UNICEF before the start of the program. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. \nMercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and provide refresher trainings for staff.\nThis programme will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. \nScreening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level, though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programme. \nChildren in the nutrition programme will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A according to IMAM guidelines. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anaemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anaemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition programme will receive deworming drugs. In addition, children in the nutrition programme will receive relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A according to Somalia IMAM guidelines. \nSerious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia. Mercy-USA will thus support provision of routine EPI activities. This will continue to increase immunization coverage among women and children lt5 years. Nomadic groups and remote or difficult to access communities are most at risk of missing out on routine EPI. Therefore, Mercy-USA will facilitate outreach EPI teams.",

        "description": "Evictions represent a unique protection challenge in Somalia with far-reaching consequences on physical security, dignity, and livelihood of victims. Bossosa is one of the epicenters of the problem as the region struggles to recover from the residual effects of the 2016-17 drought amid persistent insecurity, cyclic natural disasters, and widespread unlawful evictions. At the national level, Somalia is faced with the daunting prospect of rebuilding the country having been riven by more than two decades of conflict and lawlessness. Important strides are being made to address the issue but ongoing initiatives have been outmatched due to the prevalence of the problem, thus necessitating a more robust, integrated and coordinated program response. In the absence of an effective response to address protection challenges that are being exacerbated by eviction, displaced communities will remain at risk of continuing secondary displacements. Efforts to strengthen protection and contribute to durable solutions to displacement in Bossaso will be incomplete and/or undermined without addressing the issue of eviction concurrently and systematically. The project seeks to contribute towards ensuring that individuals affected by displacement receive support assistance to improve their tenure security situation and address post-eviction complications.\n\nThis action builds on NRC\u2019s hands on expertise in evictions prevention and response programming in Somalia, and targeting 37,198 individuals in Bossaso, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced communities at risk of eviction and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of log lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities aimed at reducing the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthening tenure security among displaced communities at highest risk of eviction, and consolidating the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include supporting the establishment of dedicated evictions prevention capacities at the municipality of Bossaso, replicating eviction programming best practices at the municipality, helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash, and strengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities. A parallel objective of the HLP Sub Cluster which this project will seek to advance is consolidating HLP capacity among national organization.\n\nA combination of deliverables will contribute toward the mitigation of protection risks exacerbated by evictions through integrated prevention and response initiatives ensuring that displaced communities have increased access to information and specialized services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights and supporting local mechanisms to address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion.",

        "description": "In close coordination with NRC and DRC, AVORD has developed this proposal with the aim of delivering a holistic, integrated response to provide life-saving services to vulnerable communities in Xudur. As elaborated in the attached teaming agreement, AVORD will take lead in the provision of Non-Food Items, emergency shelters and CCCM services in Xudur while DRC and NRC will undertake complementary WASH and Protection activities respectively. Tentative implementation arrangements have been endorsed by the three agencies with a commitment to coordinate closely and target a similar target group, hence maximizing impact and efficiency of this response.\n\nUnder the present proposal, AVORD will distribute NFIs on-Food Items (NFIs) to 4,700 IDP and host community households (estimated 28,200 persons) who live in extremely poor shelter conditions. The target group include 6,768 men, 9,024 women, 3,384 boys and 3,384 girls from the IDP community and 1,692 men, 2,256 women, 846 boys and 846 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 846 men, 1,128 women, 423 boys and 423 girls will be targeted based on disability. Each registered household will be provided with 1 NFI kit comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Lamp and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for 250 newly arrived IDPs and those living in the open. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years. The number of emergency shelters to be constructed under this project has been limited to 250 since the majority of IDPs reside in private land, making it difficult to secure enough space for the construction of a large number of shelters. However, it is anticipated that IDPs will be able to use the plastic sheets that will provided as part of the NFI kit to repair damages to their current shelters.\n\nWith regards to CCCM, AVORD will setup and strengthen camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and trigger system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of 2 culturally-appropriate multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping, site monitoring and safety audits will be undertaken in close coordination with NRC, DRC, the CCCM cluster and other humanitarian partners in the area to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. Site maintenance committees in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out.\n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with a clear criterion to prioritize the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. The effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

Where market conditions allow based on survey data, AVORD will adapt a Cash-based approach to implementation otherwise, an in-kind, direct distribution modality will be adapted. Disbursement of relief items will be made in close coordination with the shelter cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In each distribution, priority will be given to most vulnerable households in humanitarian emergency including the disabled, the chronically-ill, female headed households and families with the largest number of children under the age of 5. Full beneficiary details such as contact information will be captured throughout the process to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. Within 4 to 8 weeks of each distribution, a Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in the region and with other humanitarian partners including NRC and DRC with whom AVORD has signed a memorandum of cooperation, to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

They will be distributed to newly arrived IDPs, protracted IDPs and affected host who did not receive any assistance in 2019 or early 2020 and mainly affected by flood. The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) living in the IDP site reside in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that jeopardize their physical security, privacy, and from vagaries of nature and diseases. \n\nUnder this project, HAPEN will distribute 3954 NFIs and 3954 ESKs as in-kind to 9 IDP site in Gedo region Dollow: (Kabasa = 655, Qansahley = 550, Host 100), Luuq: Jazeera =314, Xero kowad= 470 and Boyle=420 Host =100), and Garbahrey: (Towfiq =270, Tula qorah =345, Hashi Weer =380, Tafta taag =250 and Host 100).\n\nBeneficiaries will be selected through a participatory process driven by a representative project and site management committees while ensuring marginalized groups interests are catered for and vulnerable approach, considering issues such as women-headed and child-headed households, orphans, disabled, the old among and new arrivals, protracted, and distribution.\n\nThe proposed intervention targets 3654 IDP HHs (21,924 IDP persons) and 300 IDP host HHs (1,800) in Dollow, Garbaharey and Luuq. The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. \n\nFollowing a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs. HAPEN will employ an owner-driven approach in the construction of emergency shelters by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process.\n\nProtection and GBV concerns will be factored during site selection and will be integrated in all aspects of the response. Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.\n\nOn monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. \n\nThe PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. \n\n3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM.

        "title": "Addressing the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP Families (13,296 persons) in Afgoye and Marka districts of Lower Shabelle region.",
        "description": "This project is intended to address the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 persons) of newly conflict and flood affected population as well as the most vulnerable protracted IDP families for life-saving in both districts \u2013 Afgoye and Marka \u2013 Lower Shabelle region.  With the presence of the Somali National Army (SNA) and AMISOM, Al Shabab, and clan militia, the security situation in the region had become more volatile than it was before. Security operations carry out by SNA and AMISOM alongside the USA drone airstrike targeting Alshabaab Militia caused humanitarian consequences to the civilians in the region. Within March 2020, joint forces SNA/AMISOM took over Janale village as a strategic business center it is about 13KM to Marka district. As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. \nThus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need \u2013 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.\nAlthough markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. \nDuring the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it's quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.\nThe main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)). The project will ensure full coordination among humanitarian service provides especially shelter cluster partners who are working in the project areas in order to avoid duplications.",

        "title": "Providing life-saving and sustainable WASH services to underserved IDP communities in Bardera",
        "description": "IDP communities in Bardera face cyclical scarcity to safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Bardera. During the most recent floods in October 2019, 90 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Bardera IDP communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. \n\nACTED will respond to this compounded risk by implementing a market-based project in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Bardera, including Bulo Ceesan, Bulo Garass, Liban, Xabalcadey, Horseed and Kulmiya IDP sites, and will serve 2634 households (15804 individuals). To ensure the sustainability of this action, ACTED will collaborate with the private sector to extend existing water networks to these communities and where necessary construct new water assets. Moreover, ACTED will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable IDP communities, whilst establishing relationships with the private sector for continued maintenance and operation of these assets.",

        "description": "This is an integrated project, whereby three organizations including NRC, DRC, and AVORD, will target the same locations and beneficiaries with complementary activities. The project is framed around four sector areas, Shelter, WASH, Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) and Protection. NRC will intervene in the WASH sector, DRC in Protection sector while AVORD in Shelter and CCCM sectors to complement each other's activities. The project will be targeting the same locations and beneficiaries in various settlements in Xudur district.\n\n A pre-teaming agreement has been uploaded/attached to this proposal (see attached Annex-1) providing further details on the approach and rationale of the collaboration. In essence, the multi-cluster, multi-sector and multi-agency approach, will maximize assistance as different sectors and actors will be able to share critical information and inform immediate programming and re-design of programs. This approach will be useful to create synergies of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact. The interventions will support the targeted communities holistically and efficiently by providing well-tailored and packaged responses to address different needs of the people of concern. The integrated response is in line with SHF principles by prioritization direct implementation and supporting the integration of response across clusters. \n\n10 settlements will be targeted by all agencies (the name of these settlements are mentioned in attached Annex-3) and will reach 17,131 individuals (50% females) through WASH interventions that includes rehabilitation of existing productive shallow wells and installing them with complete Solar pumping system, construction of water storage facilities and distribution points. The project will improve sanitation and hygiene conditions of the target communities through construction of 450 family shared latrines with handwashing facilities, training of community based hygiene promoters to undertake awareness creation along with distribution of 1350 hygiene kits to displacement affected families. DRC will provide Protection assistance whereby AVORD will provide Shelter and CCCM assistance to the same beneficiaries. After the approval of the project, NRC and DRC will do joint needs assessment both in the district to select the most vulnerable settlements for interventions. Through this project, NRC will reach 17,131 individuals. Post Distribution, Monitoring (PDM) and post construction exercises will be carried out after 6 weeks of wash NFIs and construction of latrines to analyse the impact of the project.",
