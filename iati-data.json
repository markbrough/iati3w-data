        "description": "This project addresses the need for locally trained female teachers and teaching assistants in Galgaduud region of Somalia, which until seven years ago had no tradition of education. This organisation has already opened eight schools and runs four literacy campaigns, but the difficulties of recruiting and retaining teachers are immense. There are very few trained teachers from the area, and teachers brought in from elsewhere tend to stay for only short periods, and are exclusively male. There is a severe shortage of trained teachers in Somalia, and very few women have had the opportunity to train up to a professional standard. This particular project provides teacher training through a two year certificate course run by a local university but based in schools. This means female student teachers can live at home, making accessing the training easier. Because they are drawn from the local area, they are less likely to leave the region. The impact will be long term and educationally significant.",

The project takes place in two phases: First completing the manual clearance of Somaliland at which point mine action in Somaliland will become completely owned funded and implemented by national authorities with su\nfficient capacity to tackle any residual tasking. Finland has supported this project since 2003. Second HALO will seek and destroy community held or abandoned stockpiles of ammunition held outside of state control across their area of operations in Souther\nn Somalia. The primary beneficiaries of the project are local populations in areas where HALO will conduct mine clearance and stockpile destruction.

        "description": "A locust invasion in Somalia is threatening livelihoods as crops and vegetation for livestock foraging suffer extensive damage. According to the Somaliland National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) localized damage has been observed in Somaliland, where locusts have occupied a total of 100,000ha of Somaliland\u2019s coastal region including Woqooyi Galbeed. This has affected1,087,264 people, of which 22,853 are in IDPs camps. SC has observed the impact of the locust invasion to be most severe in Hargeisa Maroodijeh with 8,000ha of rangeland and 3,000ha of crop land damaged. In addition, Agabar and Arbasiyo villages in Gabiley districts have also been hard-hit with 1,000ha of damaged land. The Woqooyi Galbeed region was already characterized by significant food security gaps which is exacerbated by the desert locust crisis. According to the FSNAU technical release 153,000 people are food insecure (IPC 3 or 4) including 12,054 in Gabiley district and 139,134 in Hargeisa district. An SC survey showed that pastoralists are skipping meals or selling their remaining livestock for low prices to purchase food. There is also an increasing trend of labor migration at the critical time of Gu seasonal preparation. Only few actors respond to the locust crisis in this area including SOS and World Vision. Response gaps affirmed by the Food Security Cluster (FSC) monthly dashboard show 150,000 people need urgent Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to protect access to food security. These include IDPs and pastoralists who have lost their livestock and have less than 6 goats. In addition to the locust crisis, Somalia is also at risk of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Somalia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 16th March 2020 and currently has 60 recorded cases including 5 in Somaliland and 2 in Woqooyi Galbeed. Given the rapid pace of the virus and lack of access to testing kits, there are concerns that the number of cases will rise rapidly.",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021.

        "description": "Some 1.5 billion people, half of the world\u2019s poor, live in fragile settings where the government is unable or unwilling to fulfill its core responsibilities to protect and care for its citizens. In such fragile settings, often characterized by variable levels of violent conflict, perspectives for stability and sustainable inclusive development - key priorities of the Dutch Government - continue to be extremely bleak. Whereas each fragile setting is unique, a broad international consensus exists on the multiple and complex causes that need to be addressed for a transition out of fragility. Among these, establishing inclusive governance processes is considered essential. A key obstacle for achieving stability and sustainable development in fragile settings is the structural exclusion of segments of society from local, district level and national governance processes. Our theory of change (TOC) addresses this with a focus on inclusive governance processes, referring to the extent to which governance processes provide space to overcome the systematic exclusion of disadvantaged groups seeking to participate in decision making. Therefore this strategic partnership\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to inclusive and effective governance processes in fragile settings. Specific target and impact groups may vary country by country and will be determined on the basis of thorough analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of women in governance processes is key to stability and development in all countries and therefore crosscuts all program interventions.",

        "description": "The project will support the Somali Health Authorities in 10 targeted districts (Abdiazir, Bondhere, Hamarweyne, Hodan, Shangani, Shibis, Waberi, Wadajir, Wardhigley, Yaqshid) in Banadir to: 1. Increase access to, utilisation and quality of health and nutrition services at community, primary and secondary health levels, especially for women, children and vulnerable populations and; 2. Strengthen the health system under the stewardship of the Somali Health Authorities (SHAs). The project\u2019s approach focuses on strengthening the SHAs\u2019 capacity at the regional, district and community levels to deliver the EPHS (core services 1-6). Lessons from Joint Health Nutrition Programme (JHNP) and other programmes, identified a critical management gap at the district level in Banadir. A core focus of the project\u2019s methodology is therefore to support the Regional health Officer (RHO) in Banadir to establish and develop a District Health Management Team (DHMT) in each of the 10-targeted districts. Having an operational management body at district level, within the SHA structure, will be an essential component of ensuring that the health facilities and community/female health workers (CHWs/FHWs), in their respective districts, are able to receive the technical, management and logistical support required for them to successfully deliver integrated, quality, health and nutrition services that the population can access. This is a structure and model that has been demonstrated to be successful in other health systems (e.g. in Kenya). The consortium will work closely with the RHO throughout the project to establish, develop and support the DHMTs.",

It addresses knowledge gaps and generates evidence to help people cope with crises and meet their basic needs in the Horn of Africa, Sahel, and the Middle East. There are many drivers of crisis and poverty in this region. They include climate change, which has increasing impact on fragile, natural resource-based livelihoods. The target group for this programme are poor men and women, primarily in pastoralist areas of the Sahel and East Africa, who can benefit from improved agricultural support. SPARC\u2019s work is intended to inform FCDO\u2019s and other development agencies\u2019 programmes to strengthen the resilience of agricultural and pastoralist livelihoods, in the context of climate change. SPARC will: 1) Undertake new research that builds the evidence base where there are clear gaps on how to effectively deliver programmes and adapt policies. 2) Develop and support innovation, including through the use of technology, in FCDO and partner programmes, and in response to emerging agendas. 3) Targeted technical support to  country offices and programmes in the design, delivery and evaluation of existing programmes. 4) Develop and share lessons by curating knowledge, convening debates and undertaking broader communications and engagement initiatives to inform both the development of future policies and programmes, and technical support, ensuring that the research remains operationally relevant. 5) Research uptake and dissemination: to ensure that new analysis and tailored research is highly accessible to policy- and decision-makers, so that they can benefit from the programme\u2019s innovation and learning and apply it to their work. The programme will engage closely with FCDO country offices to ensure that FCDO country programmes and policies build on the evidence generated from the research. The programme helps deliver the UK Humanitarian Reform Policy and World Humanitarian Summit commitments.",

The impact of the programme is improved health of Somalis, leading to improved human development and economic development outcomes for Somalia. This will be measured through two indicators: 1) Reduction in the maternal mortality ratio and 2) Reduction in the under-five mortality rate.\nThe outcome is increased utilisation and access to reproductive, nutrition, child and maternal health services as delivered by the EPHS. This will be measured through four indicators: 1) Increase contraceptive prevalence rate, 2) Increased utilisation of key health services by women of reproductive age, and 3) Increased utilisation of key health service by children under five, and 4) Increased number of health authorities capacitated and implementing EPHS management functions.\nThis programme will implement activities under Component 1 of DFID\u2019s SHINE programme, supply of EPHS. This programme will implement activities between April 2016 and March 2021 under six outputs that reflect the HSSP building blocks:\n1. Health Governance and Leadership: Improved governance and leadership at all levels of the health sector to manage and oversee the EPHS;\n2. Health Workforce: Skilled and trained public health workforce produced and distributed equitably to deliver reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health and nutrition services through a continuum of care, within the EPHS framework;\n3. Service Delivery: Improved availability, accessibility, affordability, acceptability and adaptability of quality health and nutrition services within the EPHS framework;\n4. Health Financing: Equitable and efficient health financing systems in place to deliver the EPHS framework;\n5. Medical Products and Technologies: Improved availability and quality of essential medicines, vaccines, nutrition commodities, medical equipment and physical structures;\n6. Health Information: Improved access, availability, acceptability, quality and use of health information, including a health management information system (HMIS).",

        "description": "In Puntland pastoralism, fishing and trading, are the three main economic activities. They are highly complementary and interdependent, and constitute the basis of the present economy. However, poverty rate in Somalia is amongst the highest in the world. It affects 60% of the population in urban households and over 95% of the population in rural households. \nPuntland is host to an estimated 149,000 IDPs, refugees and asylum seekers and insecurity is the major cause of displacement, followed by drought and the lack of livelihood opportunities. Access to land and water continue to be the primary challenges for host communities and IDP, as well as forced relocation for IDP. Limited livelihoods make it difficult for Somalis to cope with environmental or political shocks. For children, Somalia has been characterized as one of the most challenging countries to grow up in. Only 29% of the children in Somalia attend primary school, and only 7% of the secondary school-age population attends secondary school. Poverty is one of the main reasons why children are sent out to work instead of going to school. In addition, about 33% of girls compared to 21% of boys had to work at home instead of attending school.\nThe partner, Galkayo Education Center for Peace and Development (GECPD), will implement the project in Harfo District, Mudug Region, Puntland Stateand will work in;\nDecent Work: Collection of data and development of Somalia country profiles for decent work in fragile contexts; Advocacy on development of coherent labour laws;&nbsp; Advocacy for guidelines on abolishment of child labour; Training and advocacy on establishment of cooperatives and unions. \nWomen Economic Empowerment: Mapping of market needs and opportunities for women; Value chain analysis and private sector development for increased employment opportunities, specifically targeting women; Support to income generating activities, in particular targeting women, youth and IDPs; Entrepreneurship support, in particular for women and youth\nThe actors with the most significant impact on the programme and also those that will be most affected by the programme, include right holders (women, men, youth, IDP and other marginalized groups) CSOs, government bodies, private sector, religious and traditional leaders, local businesses/private sector.",

Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo declared the drought a national disaster on 28 February 2017.\nDrought affected families are resorting to a range of negative coping strategies including reducing the number of meals eaten in a given day, skipping meals, accumulation of debts or obtaining food on credit from shops, as well as migration in search of livelihood. IDPs rely heavily on support from the host community. Besides, the maternal mortality rate for Somalia is among the highest in the world at 732 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Water shortage may also trigger further outbreak of water borne diseases.\nOxfam provides integrated EFSVL (Emergency Food Security and Vulnerable Livelihoods) and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) support to vulnerable women, men, boys and girls affected by drought in Sool, Sanaag, Toghdeer and Awdal regions as an immediate life saving intervention whilst taking steps to ensure the response contributes to the capacity building and resilience of communities and partners.

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly.

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly. A totalof 3.500 households will benefit from better information and a improved programming as a result.'",

        "description": "WiP!\u2019s theory of change identifies three key pathways \u2013 which inform our aims \u2013 to enable young people from diverse backgrounds to generate sustainable living wages and create optimism about their future in Egypt, Nigeria and Somalia. Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

The Food Security and Livelihoods component of the project will deliver Multi-Purpose Cash to assist vulnerable households to access food and other necessities. Oxfam will collaborate with the Ministry of Livestock in a livestock vaccination campaign to treat the most common endo and ecto parasites to improve animal health in pastoralist communities, and will further work with vulnerable youth and women to diversify their livelihoods with vocational skills training and piloting of Voluntary Savings Groups. This will help increase employability and income, and will also contribute to building the capacity of women to take a more active role in decision making in their communities. The project will incorporate specific community protection activities engaging community protection volunteers, existing community committees and women#s groups to raise and mitigate protection risks at community level. Oxfam will map available services in target communities and engage with service providers on confidential referral pathways. Trainings on basic protection principles, rights and responsibilities will target community committees, women#s groups, community protection volunteers and relevant authorities will be capacity built to strengthen regional and national protection mechanisms.",

        "description": "On 2nd February 2020 the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of the Federal Government of Somalia has declared a national emergency (see press statement in attachment) in view of the current Desert Locust upsurge that poses a major threat to Somalia#sfragile food security situation. Food sources for people and their livestock are at risk. The Desert Locust swarms are uncommonly large and consume huge amounts of crops and forage.\nAccording to locust office of the Ministry of Agriculture and HADMA  latest report, there were huge swarm of Desert locust from Yemen that at the end September 2019 laid eggs in many locations in Somaliland. Despite controlefforts, a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak is threatening crops and pasture across Northern Somali regions. Accordingto experts, this is the worst outbreak in over 25 years in Somalia.\n\nThe situation has rapidly deteriorated in January 2020, as weather conditions have been unusually conductive to the spread of the pest. After cyclone Pawanmade landfall in early December 2019, flooding across the Horn of Africa created favourable breeding conditions for desert locusts. These conditions allow the breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locust with the formation of large numbers of swarm as FAO indicated in their latest Appeal .\nDesert Locust breeding is ongoing in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug (Mudug). An estimated 70,000 hectares of land has been invaded by hoppers and breeding adults. Once they mature the locusts areexpected to migrate in swarms and move south towards the Ethiopian border area of Somaliland as well as Jubaland, Southwest State and Hirshabelle. These swarms will be at their most destructive stage and pose a very severe risk to Deyr season food and fodder production.\nMating adults, hoppers and swarms have been detected in Northwest Somalia (between Bulhar and Silil). Hoppers and immature adults were reported on the Northwest plateau and a swarm was detected between Burao and the Ethiopian border. Hopper bands were also reported south of Bossaso, south of Las Anod (near the Ethiopian border) and in Galmudug (near Galkayo). More swarms are likely to form along the Northwest coast and plateau, which may migrate to Djibouti, Eastern Ethiopia and SouthernSomalia.\nCrop and pastures have already been damaged in Somalia impacting negatively onagropastoral and pastoral households. In December 2019, it was reported that a huge number of desert locust (still at the stage of hopper bands) hatched in differentbreeding areas of Somaliland, such as coastal areas and farming land, posing a new devastating threat to crops and pasture lands.",

Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.\nThe Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 callsso far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identifiedthrough the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.\n\nThis project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helpline service in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.",

Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.\nThe Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 callsso far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identifiedthrough the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.\n\nThis project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helpline service in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.",

This intervention forms approximately 70% of the total cash transfer programming under Oxfam\u2019s overall response and will be implemented directly by Oxfam by engaging electronic financial service provider in Puntland via mobile phones. Beneficiarieswho don\u2019t possess Sim-cards will receive them as part of this response and be trained on its usage. The overall Oxfam food securityintervention which this contributes towards will include additional emergency livelihoods and recovery elements including cash for work interventions to rebuild destroyed feeder roads.Oxfam targets households that meet the critical food insecurity criteria takingintoconsideration gender-differentiated needs. The selection criteria will be discussed with thetarget women, men, boys and girls toensure fairness of the selection process. Usually, women are registered as beneficiaries and the head of the household for cash transfers. At times we find that some polygamous households are includedduring registration stage and this is addressed during verification, ensuring that the most vulnerable HH are Commented [AC12]: In addition to these activities DEC funds can also be used to coverany hygiene promotion activities/hygiene kits, COVID messaging, PPE for staffif needed?Commented [MH13R12]: We Have some PPE in thefield, Moses to add purchase of some PPE in the budget\ntargeted, in collaboration with community leaders. Female-headed households are the most affected as they do not have access to meaningful household assets such as livestock, or other sources of income. In Bari region, priorities for livelihood regeneration activities are different for women and men. Oxfam will deliver emergency food security interventions through cash grants for the most vulnerable people, while supporting household income by strengtheningand diversifying livelihoods through other projects. Oxfam's programming since March 2017 has successfully diversified the source of livelihoods in traditional pastoralist communities in Somaliland with plansto replicate this expereicnce in Puntland. This intervention will help vulnerable households to have some disposable income which they can use to purchase or meet their household food needs.Most vulnerable community members that will be most in need of the emergency assistance through this action will be identified through participatory mapping exercises conducted at village level through specific exercises including well-being rankings, vulnerability mapping, food consumption score, household purchasing power, among others. Gender will be consideredwhen selecting households to help reduce the additional burden on women headedhouseholds. The criteria shall be clearly explained to the selection committee/panel prior toselection, with clearcommunication on what beneficiaries will be entitled to during the project, to avoid unrealistic expectations.",

        "description": "2020 was one of the hardest years for Somalia in decades. Flooding, COVID-19 and recurring locust invasions heavily impacted on theeconomy and livelihoods of people. The government implemented measures to contain COVID-19, including the closure of schools, reduction of movement and other economic activities. The coastal areas of Puntland and Somaliland were also hit by cyclone Gati in November 2020, resulting in a sharp increase in humanitarian needs which many organizations - including Oxfam Somalia - responded to. While the performance of the 2020 Gu rain was near normal, the Deyr rain of 2020 has been categorized a complete failure due to the La Nina conditions. These developments triggered severe water shortages in many regions and districts in Somalia. Since October 2020, regional administrations, communities and other humanitarian agencies have been sending alerts about looming drought conditions in many parts of Somalia.Oxfam\u2019s feedback hotline continues to receive a high number of calls from people requesting immediate water interventions. These callers are mainly from the Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions. UNOCHA assessment findings indicate that over 50% of the communities in the assessed locations reported displacement of people due to water shortages, 85% raised major concerns on watershortages, and 14 out of 40 villages reported an increase in diarrheal cases. The price of water has already more than doubled. According to Oxfam\u2019s own market assessment, one barrel of water is currently being sold at an average of USD 4.5 per barrel, with some villages reporting over USD 7 per barrel. This is forcing the most vulnerable households to travel long distances to fetch water and/or opt for poor water quality and risk their lives. The most affected communities include IDPs and low-income host communities. Women and girls are at risk of protection-related risks as they travel in search of water.\nRegarding COVID-19, over 4,784 cases with over 130 fatalities were registered by the WHO in Somalia since the start of the pandemic, with many cases left undetected due to asymptomatic infections, low testing capacity and the stigmatisation of COVID-19 cases among the population. The second wave of the pandemic seems to have also hit the country as the number of cases started to increase in the last few months. The government of Somaliahas eased most of the restrictions in August 2020 and most of the public services have resumed. This increases the risk of vulnerability to COVID-19 and the shortages of water in many areas further restrict the communities' ability to frequently wash their hands with soap. This might create a favourable environment for COVID-19 to spread.\nThe Ministry of Water Development in Somaliland shareda request with all humanitarian agencies, indicating that over 196,848 people are in need of urgent water interventions and that many others also require quick rehabilitations of their water sources. Over 88% of the people in need are from the Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer regions of Eastern Somaliland. In October 2020, Oxfam using the ECHO crisis modifier budget reached the most vulnerable 1,800 HH (10,800 people) in Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer for 30 days with WASH interventions. Since then, we have continued to advocate for urgent interventions by sharing summary reports with the Somalia WASH cluster and presentations of the situation with cluster members. Utilising other existing resources, we are also working with the Ministry of Water Resources to rehabilitate boreholes that were identified as strategic wells by the government.",

        "description": "In summary, this project proposes to contribute to three core aspects of Camp Coordination and Camp Management in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District, including leading essential coordination functions, developing and maintaining camp infrastructures that have been devastated by recent flooding.establishing/Rehabilitating/Enhancing drainage systems in IDP sites through incentivized workdays carried out by site-level site maintenance committees, and promoting humanitarian accountability through the operation of feedback and complaint mechanisms. Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money.

        "description": "Displacement, cramped living conditions and other related stressors following flooding all serve to exacerbate tensions and increase violence in the home and in communities, with women and girls most at risk. With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries. Approximately 50 (20 girls and women) will be engaged in GBV safety audit and action planning in their communities. 4,000 (1,220girls,1,260 women, 800 boys and 720 men) will be reached through door to door community outreach and over 25,000 reached through GBV radio advocacy and awareness creation. 450 dignity kits and 250 emergency support kits and 2000 sanitary kits will be distributed. Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management.

        "description": "In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region.

        "description": "Based on the analysis of the current flood situation in the target locations, NoFYL intends to extend its protection monitoring programme to contribute towards enhancing protection, increasing safety and promoting dignity of conflict-affected women, men, girls and boys, in Kismayo and Balcad. These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.     Increased availability of legal services for post flood HLP issues.\n\nNoFYL is currently an SPMS partner leading data collections in Kismayo, Afgoye and Mogadishu (Deynille amp Kaxda districts).",

In order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in the affected areas and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called 'Kobo Tool box' to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with 'Do No Harm' principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $145 (80% or $116 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $29 as the second installment) per HH will be provided for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . A predetermined beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . These criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use M and E tools that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. This action shall deliver urgent humanitarian flood response assistance in the form of cash for NFIs and ESKs to 1,350 HHs (8,100 individuals) in district Belet Weyne.\n\nTo ensure that the assistance provided is used for intended purposes, NRC s will coordinate all components of this action with the community to ensure thorough sensitization and beneficiary participation  for individuals and the community at large .A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash and while also assess the impact of the response, generate and document lessons learned for dissemination to multiple stakeholders.",

The floods also affected the road to the airport. On 12th and 13th October 2020, heavy rains triggered flash floods in the riverine villages affecting about 3,600 people.  The Jowhar authorities reported that two children drowned as the result of the flash floods.The floods caused various impact to the WASH facilities the findings indicate that only less than 10% of the total affected population have access to safe water drinking water. Most of the infrastructure such as latrines have submerged and destroyed as the result of the floods. Sanitation is a serious issue due to the inadequate number of latrines in comparison to the population in need and many people are practice open defecation due to lack of sufficient latrines against the population. Lack of adequate and safe sanitation puts women, girls and at risk of physical violence and sexual assault as they relieve themselves in the open field.The water have been contaminated and not fit for human consumption leading to potential outbreaks of water-borne diseases and acute water diarrhea.Therefore, in order to fill the gaps Islamic relief Somalia with funding from OCHA is planning to fill the gaps by rehabilitating of 5 shallow wells, two 2 boreholes and construction of 200 flood latrines.The project aims to tackle the effects emanating from the floods by providing emergency WASH services in Jowhar district, Somalia. The intervention is in line with the WASH strategy. It will also link to recovery and resilience building of the communities by rehabilitating WASH infrastructure that will assist 16,500 direct beneficiaries affected by Hagaa floods in Jowhar .The project will install solar power systems to the two (02) boreholes that are to be  rehabilitated  in jowhar depending on the needs while the rehabilitation of five (05) shallow wells will be undertaken at Mahaday,gumeysta,congo,marerey and cali warabey.

The combined forces of CCCM and WASH aim to deliver essential COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement activities while establishing necessary water points and handwashing platforms for better hygiene practices.  Moreover, the use of radio media will look to provide an additional layer of awareness and critical thinking related to community-based responses and prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society, and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites. AVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster\u2019s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster\u2019s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster\u2019s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group.

        "description": "According to OCHA flash floods report Since July, up to 166,379 people have been affected by flash floods in Afgooye, Marka and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle region when riverbanks broke along River Shabelle. The floods have displaced in Wanlaweyn alone more than 82,000 people, inundated homes, wells and schools and destroyed large swathes of farmland and crops The heavy deyr rains ave caused massive population displacement, damaged housing, property, infrastructure and farm lands in riverine areas in southern Somalia. WASH Cluster has reported critical gaps in Balcad, Marka and Wanlaweyn where no WASH assistance has been received despite high risk levels for AWD.\nThe main aim of this project is to provide lifesaving WASH services to most vulnerable and underserved communities living in floods affected areas in Wanlaweyn district of Lower Shabelle Region. A total of 17,000 flood affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally throughout the project period.\n\nSOYDA in collaboration with the local authority, partnership with main water vendors in rural villages in Wanlaweyn district, will provide emergency water voucher to the 6,400 (1408 men, 1,536 women, 1,728 boys and 1,728 girls) targeted beneficiaries including people with disabilities and marginalized communities in the targeted IDP camps, which they can redeem for water at the specified water vendors (water trucks). The action also includes to hire water truck of a capacity of 6,000 liters of safe water to the targeted locations. Each voucher can be used to redeem specified quantity of safe water of 7.5 liters per person per day for a period of 30 days. The project will build the capacity of 1q WASH Committees (composing 4 men and 3 women per Committee) shared equally men and women on operation and maintenance of developed water infrastructures shall be throughout the project implementation period, to ensure the sustainability of the developed water facilities after the project is faced out. SOYDA will make sure that men, women, girls and boys including people with disabilities and marginalized community have equal access to the rehabilitated/constructed WASH services. SOYDA will upgrade/rehabilitate two boreholes equipped with hybrid to improve its water quality and reduce its running cost, in order to receive the community their water needs at an affordable cost. SOYDA will replace the engine powered boreholes in to hybrid system and construct 8 water kiosks nearer to the IDP settlements supplied water through piping network to avoid the risk of rape against women and girls in Wanlaweyn district. The project will provide reliable and sustainable access to environmental sanitation through construction of 100 IDP latrines in Wanlaweyn district. The latrines will be gender separated and flood proof with lockable doors and hand washing basins. construction of latrines will be implemented through market-based programming. \n\nSOYDA will distribute 80 sanitation sets to 10 IDP camps, in order to improve the environmental sanitation of the targeted locations. The aim of the sanitation sets distribution is to carry out clean-up campaigns, in order to reduce the spread of AWD/cholera diseases and to improve the environmental sanitation of the target locations. SOYDA will conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns focusing hand washing with soap practices to 17,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, health facilities, and nutrition centers. SOYDA will also train 30 Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) shared equally men and women, selected from the target communities and IDPs, so that in their turn they can educate the entire population to change their behaviors. 1600 HP kits will be distributed to the most vulnerable and underserved communities in the target locations",

The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

        "description": "Merka communities face scarcity of safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods coupled with the effect of pandemic since march 2020. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement this intervention in 31 sites across Burao and Buhodle (16 sites in Burao and 15 sites in Buhodle). \n\nFEWS NET Post Deyr technical release projects that in Togdheer region of Somaliland that 181,000 people will be stressed IPC phase 2, 91,000 in crisis IPC phase 3 and 13,000 in emergency IPC phase 4 by June, 2020 if humanitarian assistance is not extended to the region. \n\nCamp coordination and camp management is a relatively new concept within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized on this concept.

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019. PDM also monitors expenditure patterns of the provided support and determines measures for corrective actions if there are deviations from objective.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is that the food security situation of 865 vulnerable households (5160 individuals) in mostly rural communities in Zeylac district of Somaliland is stabilized and communities are more resilient towards adverse conditions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers: a) unconditional and b) conditional cash transfers for improved access to food. The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

Agro-pastoralistsand pastoralists have been badly affected by the 2019 drought which has caused widespread crop failure, water shortages, and depleted livestock levels.\nMore than 4.2 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019, and the number ofpeople who are food insecure is expected to increase in the coming months.  This year#s severe drought has been caused by abnormally hot, dry conditions during January-March and the failure of the rains in April-June. Most households are already adopting negativecoping strategies to mitigate food insecurity, including reducing food intake. Poor transportation and market infrastructure make it difficult for pastoralists to access markets, and there are few fed markets to provide animals with nutrition when natural pastures are inadequate. Over 80% of livestock was lost as a result of the 2017 drought, and the population of livestock herds, essential for pastoralists# food and income, have not yet recovered.\nThe impact of the 2019 drought on the water and sanitation sector has beensignificant. Water supply (boreholes, shallow wells) is severely limited and the cost of accessing water has increased sharply, representing a severe burden on insufficient household income. Existing groundwater sources contain a highly mineralized content, rendering it unsuitable for drinking, but a prior Oxfam needs assessment showed that the vast majority of households in the project area do not treat their water. Open defecation remains common, increasing protection risks for women and girls who venture outside alone or during the night or move far from dwellings to known open defecation areas.\nOxfam aims to assist at least 500,000 affected peoplewith immediate food security and WASH programming along with resilience and recovery interventions to diminish the impact of recurring droughts on vulnerable populations. Oxfam will embed activities to strengthen the protection of women, men, boys, and girls within the EFSVL and WASH workstreams.",

The fund will build oncurrent initiatives in country to promote local humanitarian leadership and preparedness, and deliver on commitments made in the Grand Bargain and Charter for Change by donor andNGO signatories. It will also identify strengths and areas for capacity development in relation to emergency response in Somalia The operating procedure for the Anticipatory Response Fund will include triggers and related protocols, such that a pilot test of triggers, collaboration mechanisms and protocols can take place ahead ofthe humanitarian response windows, in the second half of 2020.\nBeyond the pilot phase, these actions will lay the foundations for a response mechanism that is pre-emptive and therefore efficient and highly responsive # improving the quality of locally-led humanitarian response in Somalia and Somaliland. Delivering on the ambition statement (i.e. development of above-mentioned model for humanitarian programming and operating procedures) will contribute to all four DRA strategic priorities: 1) more effective support for locally-led responses by supporting Nexus as locally-led platform; 2) innovation and learning by generating knowledge outputs and new ways of working; 3) collaboration for increased effectiveness by bringing together a wide range of localactors with coverage of all 9 regions of Somalia and Somaliland; and 4) more accountable humanitarian action by giving voice and decision making power to local organisations and adding rigor through South-South peer review.",

While international donors, including Canada, have already stepped up with humanitarian assistance to save lives and protect livelihoods, a significant funding gap persists and humanitarian needs are expected to escalate well into 2017. The impact is most pronounced in Ethiopia, which experienced its worst drought in 50 years, leaving 10 million people in need of emergency food assistance. In the Americas, Haiti is one of the most affected countries, with a third consecutive year of drought, exacerbated by El Ni\u00f1o, leaving more than 3.6 million people food insecure. Similar impacts are being felt around the globe. To date, twenty three countries have appealed for help to meet critical needs, including food, agricultural support, and water and sanitation.  With GAC's support, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is promoting early recovery and resilience building in some of the countries worst hit by El Ni\u00f1o, including Ethiopia, Haiti, Malawi, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Although specific programming differs based on the context in each country, FAO is protecting the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable groups, such as subsistence farmers and pastoralists, with agricultural inputs and livestock support.",

While District Councils are mandated to provide services to citizens, there is still an unclear delineation of roles and responsibilities, as most sectors are (in practice) not yet decentralised from the line ministries and in many cases delivery been taken over by NGOs. Furthermore, there is a palpable mismatch between the responsibilities allocated to districts and the (financial and human) resources they have.\n\nThe Association of Local Government Authorities of Somaliland (ALGASL) was established in 2006 by the mayors of 10 district councils. ALGASL aims to build strong local governments and support decentralisation, benefiting local communities, including marginalized groups such as women, youth and IDPs. At present, ALGASL has 10 paying members out of the 23 districts with elected district councils. Though ALGASL has potential, the association is constrained by a lack of human and financial resources, which hinders its ability to fulfill its mandate and attract additional members.\n\nIf strengthened, ALGASL can play a pivotal role in working towards more legitimate local governments, because of its mandate to lobby and advocate for the interests of districts and to build their capacity. It is a highly relevant linchpin between central and local government, can provide nationwide outreach and can promote exchange of experience among districts through its platform function.",

The main area of research and learning will be changes in access to services (access to health facilities in DRC and access to justice in Somalia) and how this contributes to conflict prevention and to inclusive peacebuilding processes. This pillar is managed from the UK. Please note: when funds are allocated to the UK this is to the general benefit of all IRC Programmes and the wider sector.",

The proposed project seeks to challenge harmful social norms including Female Genital Mutilation and Child Early and Forced Marriage and to increase womens social and economic empowerment through interventions at the individual, household, community and societal levels. Successful implementation of these interventions will result in reduction in harmful practices, increased value of women and girls and will contribute towards greater voice, choice and control for Somali women and girls over their bodies and futures (Project Impact). This will be achieved transforming social norms to support gender equality in Somalia (Outcome) through three key outcome areas: 1) Enhanced legal and policy environment for greater equality of women and girls; 2) Improved knowledge and attitudes of men, women, girls and boys on gender discriminatory social norms; and 3) Increased social and economic empowerment of women and girls. IRC will be working in Galkayo (South), Hobyo, Hawal-wadag, Karaan.",

It builds on ongoing work to promote employment, decent work and income opportunities in Somalia. The project strategy draws on the findings of the review of the DWCP of Somalia (2014-2016), which among other issues, has pointed to the need for tailored capacity development interventions to enable workers and employers organizations to deliver services to their members and effectively engage in social dialogue. The project interventions will focus on: (i) addressing the youth employment challenges; (ii) creating a strong connection between humanitarian and development support; (iii) building on employment-intensive investment strategies; and (iv) integrating direct employment creation and skills and enterprise development for increased employability. The project is expected to provide opportunities for the ILO to leverage resources, expertise and synergies at the country level, notably through cooperation and collaboration within the UN system as well as with development partners. This project contributes to the country\u2019s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG targets 1.5 (Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters) and 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services).",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.

        "description": "This Joint FGS-UN Programme aims to capitalise on recent security, governance and reconciliation achievements by expanding employment opportunities for young men and women, mainly in newly recovered areas. The programme recognizes the centrality of youth in fostering stability in the country and outlines specific interventions that can be taken within the next 24 months to begin to generate decent work opportunities for young people that will serve as positive alternatives to participation in violence and conflict. This will also contribute to the revitalization of the local economy. The programme will tackle youth at risk, unemployed and underemployed youth. The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months. The programme will initially be tailored for the first 24 months as per the Compact deadline (see also Table 1): \u2022 1: Improved long-term potential for growth, productivity and employment of at least three value chains in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector. \u2022 2: Equip 10,000 youth with basic literacy, numeracy and life-skills and sector-specific vocational and business training to enhance their employability to access sustainable job opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential. \u2022 3: Create 30,000 short-term jobs created through cash-for-work projects to rehabilitate productive infrastructure in target locations, mainly in newly recovered areas.",

The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

The intervention will target pregnant and lactating women (PLW) together with children under the age of 5 years (CU5) amongst the host communities, IDPs and returnees in the Balcad district where Wocca is the primary rationalized partner in Adale where we are the secondary rationalized partner and also extend our services to Mahaday.  Wocca will operate 2 fixed/static outpatient therapeutic feeding centers (fixed OTPs) and 4 mobile outpatient therapeutic feeding programme teams (mobile OTPs) targeting 16 locations chosen on the basis of vulnerability and absence of nutrition interventions in the 3 districts. The static facilities will be established in Ceelow and Caddow Uul locations  and Cadale districts respectively while the 4 outreach teams will serve 14 locations namely Bulo Axmed Cigow, Kulmis Weyn, Buurfuule and Xudur Ciise in Mahaday Ceelka Cusub, Cisiley and Sheikh Rooble Garas weyne, Cadan gabey and Ceel Xamar in Cadale Xanlay, Muki dheere Bari, Bulo Walaal and Caro faag in Balcad.

Children under 5 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) conditions and no medical complications will be enrolled to the static and mobile OTPs for treatment while the cases with medical complications will be referred by the mobile clinics and CHWs to the stabilization center (SC) in Waberi star village managed by WOCCA for nutrition and medical rehabilitation. Children under 5 and PLWs with MAM conditions will be referred to TSFP center managed by ARC. CHWs and Hygiene promoters will be trained on Nutrition, Health and Hygiene Promotion (NHHP), they will disseminate hygiene promotion messages to the communities to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera during the activities as they move around with the mobile Team. Mothers will be counseled individually and in groups by trained nutrition staff and Community Health Workers (CHWs) on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. The project will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MNPs) and Vitamin A supplements to pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of 5years through the static and mobile facilities. UNICEF has been supporting WOCCA with nutrition supplies and technical guidance on previous nutrition projects within the targeted locations and currently supporting our SHF funded project running in Daynille/Kaxda IDP camps and in Balcad district. Therefore, in this project WOCCA will still engage UNICEF to provide nutrition supplies and technical support for management of SAM cases. To enhance effective coordination, WOCCA will provide monthly activity updates with partners including Nutrition cluster both regional and Nairobi level, Other agencies working in the field who are doing other sector projects in the project sites will also be updated to avoid duplication and promote effective and efficient utilization humanitarian fund.",

        "title": "Sustainable Access to clean Water,Hygiene and Sanitation to droughts affected communities in Sanaag and Sool region",
        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

Water scarcity in Sool and Sanaag regions has reached a precarious level, affecting the health of the most vulnerable people and causing occasional resource-based clan conflicts.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve WASH service delivery at district level. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness. \n\nACTED will implement these activities in Taleex district of Sool region, and Erigavo and Dararweyne districts of Sanaag region, targeting a highly vulnerable and largely undeserved area. Approximately 15,000 people (2,500 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, or escalation of conflict, which may cause communities to flee to other areas.",

A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs and emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. As hygiene promoters will interact closely with students during hygiene promotion sessions and recreational activities, CISP will train this cadre on hygiene promotion, psycho-social support (PSS), and child protection and safeguarding. Specific Protection activities will include the mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, and awareness raising and training of community education committees (CEC) on child protection. CISP will also continue to engage with Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE) and train cluster partners and MoE staffs on safe schools contingency planning, DRR and emergency response. CISP will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, proposal development, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, CISP will provide cash grants to CECs. In return, CECs will contribute in-kind or cash to procure safe water and manage its distribution to students. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacity and improve school preparedness against armed attack and other natural disasters. Disability and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. CISP will coordinate enrollment drives through MoE and with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. CISP education department will utilize the existing synergies with CISP protection department to assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, and, as determined from the assessment results, targeted schools will develop appropriate action plans to address areas of concern. To measure the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, CISP will conduct an end line assessment. Through the CISP protection department engagement with CEC\u2019s and the regional Gender Focal Points (GFP\u2019s) of MoE, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

        "description": "This project aims at restoring stable communities in Somalia through establishing local structures that research, identify, analyse, prioritize and implement solutions to community security issues, in collaboration with local authorities, formal security actors and civil society. At the state level, it will re-establish bodies that promote community-responsive policing, acting as a link through which information on security provision is channelled, and form bridges between local, state and national levels. Learning and insights from all levels will be fed upwards through national-level civil society networks, promoting community-focused security provision at national and international level. The objectives of the programme are to strengthen the capacity of local civil society groups and communities to research and facilitate broad dialogue across clan and state-society divides about local security issues, provide resources for implementation of joint conflict prevention and community security initiatives, support cross-regional community exchange to share experiences and common security problems, link community members with existing dispute resolution mechanisms, support the re-introduction and development of regional oversight mechanisms such as police accountability committees with channels for community input, provide training on accountability, gender- and conflict-sensitivity, link these bodies into a cross-regional learning network, facilitate their engagement in policy dialogue at the federal member state level, conduct policy discourse with the Somali federal government, regional bodies and international actors to communicate evidence about inclusive approaches to improving human security, and facilitate dialogue among policy-makers at the national level and communities. This will eventually result in a reduction in inter and intra-clan division and violence, more inclusive, responsive and accountable security provision including effective mechanisms to prevent misuse of power and improve coordination, greater coherence in policy formation between Federal regions, and more evidence-based policy and programming on human security from international actors.",

        "description": "L'intervento ha come obiettivo principale l'assistenza alle vittime della crisi umanitaria in Somalia  causata dai frequenti shock climatici. Luglio 2019 ha segnato il livello pi\u00f9 basso di raccolti agricoli a partire dal 1995, il 70 sotto la media, con conseguenze umanitarie disastrose sulla popolazione. Le abbondanti piogge dell'ultimo mese hanno tuttavia provocato inondazioni nelle aree agricole, distruggendo sia gli insediamenti umani sia la produzione agricola Inoltre la mancanza di strutture igienico sanitarie di base ha causato il diffondersi del colera, della malaria e di altre malattie trasmissibili. Si stima che circa 5.4 milioni di Somali si trovino in condizione di insicurezza alimentare e necessitino di interventi urgenti per la sopravvivenza. L'intervento prevede attivit\u00e0 di emergenza anche volte al rafforzamento della resilienza con approccio DRR (Disasters Risk Reduction), di chi si trova in situazioni vulnerabili, aumentandone la capacit\u00e0 di fronteggiare futuri shock climatici, economici e sociali.",

        "description": "The proposed intervention seeks to improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices in an effort to improve the health status of 14400 people (3312-men, 3599-women, 3600-boys, and 3889-girls) in Beletweyne districts and reduce protection risks against women and girls and persons with disabilities (PWD). This will be achieved through rehabilitation of 4 flood damaged water sources including installation of 4 water distribution networks (pipeline extensions, water points installation) at settlements/sites hosting newly displaced populations and build community resilience and increase sustainability of WASH services by enhancing the capacity of 28 village level WASH management committees (women and PWDs represented) to manage, operate and maintain WASH facilities. SC also proposes to construct 76 emergency sanitation facilities and 14 disability friendly emergency sanitation facilities at IDP settlements to improve safe excreta disposal, hygiene promotion training for 15 hygiene promoters including organizing hygiene promotion campaigns once in a month in each target IDP settlement. Additionally, the project will do monthly chlorination of boreholes and shallow wells, distribution of 2000 hygiene supplies including menstrual hygiene management through market-based programing. These interventions are based on the 2021 allocation strategy paper, Joint WASH Cluster rapid assessment findings in Hiran region and the proposed activities are well aligned with the WASH cluster priorities.\nThe project is designed to ensure equitable access to WASH services by older people and those with disabilities, safety of children and dignity and privacy for women and girls. Coordination with WASH clusters at national and state levels will be maintained, in addition to ongoing coordination with general key actors in Hiran. The project will address gender issues through collection of sex and age disaggregated data which will be analyzed to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Protection of beneficiaries will be ensured during access and utilization of services seeking to reduce further risks. Save the Children (SC) aims to increase access to clean and safe drinking water, sanitation and improve hygiene knowledge and promote the adoption of safe hygiene practices among the communities, contributing to reduced risk of disease outbreak and meet both the acute and long-term needs of vulnerable IDP communities. The project will be implemented over twelve (12) months.",

It emphasizes implementing sustainable water systems, enhancing protection in WASH, and enhancing the quality of outcomes. The focus will be to construct facilities that are culturally appropriate, safe for users of all ages and gender, and accessible to persons with disabilities. In Bula-Qansax and haji Abdulahi IDP camps, an Increase in access to safe water will be done through upgrading a water treatment system previously constructed by Concern in 2017, Supported by the Government of Somalia through Funding from the World Bank. The focus will be to upgrade the pumping unit at the intake and rising main of the existing water treatment unit and pipeline extension to water points to strategic locations in the two camps. All the water points will be metered and water utilized will be paid to the private water company managing the water supply system. Two water points will be constructed each comprising 6 nozzles aimed at serving 250 people per nozzle. This will reduce the walking distance of the target IDP and reduce queuing time at the existing water points. Water points will be strategically located and will involve consultation with women, girls men and boys, and people with disabilities before construction. A water management committee will be formed at each water point to be in charge of hygiene aspects of the water points. To increase access to latrines, 136 latrines will be constructed (126 household latrines and 10 latrines for people with special needs/People With Disabilities) all fitted with handwashing facilities. Constructed latrines will be fitted with a door that will offer sufficient privacy and be lockable from inside to address and protection-related concerns. Solar street lights will be strategically located in locations where the latrines will be constructed to provide lighting to women, girls men, and women using the latrines. 24CHPs (12 Females) will be recruited and deployed to cover Bula-Qansax and Haji Abdulahi IDP camps. The CHPs will be charged with health promotion and safe for adoption and emulation of safe hygiene practices. Hygiene messaging will be done through radio ( mass media) and house-to-house visits and will be complemented with the distribution of hygiene kits which will be provided to the most vulnerable households. A total of 500 hygiene kits will be sourced from the WASH Cluster and distributed in two locations in Bula-Qansax, Haji Abdulahi in Bardhere. A total of 12,864 individuals (3988 men, 4245 women,2187 boys, and 2444 girls) will be reached with the intervention.

        "description": "According to OCHA 2021 report, climate change continues to be a major contributing factor to displacement and food insecurity in Somalia. Increasing erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions and floods, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Flooding displaced 919,000 people in 2020 and destroyed WASH infrastructures and productive assets. In tandem. Communities living in conflict areas were severely impacted by armed violence. The ongoing conflict continues to reduce the resilience of communities, trigger displacement and impede civilians\u2019 access to basic services and humanitarians\u2019 access to those in need. Exclusion and discrimination of socially marginalized groups are contributing to high levels of acute humanitarian need and lack of protection among some of the most vulnerable. IDPs remain the most vulnerable population group in Somalia. The protracted nature of displacement caused by floods, conflict, and drought continues to affect the physical and mental wellbeing of 1.6 million IDPs who require humanitarian assistance. Many IDP households have faced a steady depletion of assets and an increase in negative coping mechanisms, culminating in severe conditions with regards to their food insecurity, malnutrition, disease outbreaks, water and hygiene conditions, and critical protection concerns. According to the FSNAU report March 2021, large parts of Somalia faced severe drought conditions, triggered by below average 2020 Deyr rains and above-average temperatures during the Jilal season. Over 116,000 Somalis were displaced by water shortages between October 2020 and March 2021. Availability of water and pasture conditions have significantly deteriorated, leading to increased livestock migration and the rapid rise of water prices. According to the latest UNICEF humanitarian situation report, the water shortages and challenges of getting safe drinking water have contributed to cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) /cholera cases in some areas across the country. At the beginning of the rainy season in mid-April 2021, heavy rains in the Ethiopia highlands resulted in flood waves along the Shabelle River basin and streamed into Somalia leading to the displacement of the riverine population particularly in the northern parts of Beletweyne town, as well as damage of some community infrastructure and agriculture farms. In this project, AADSOM will implement safe WASH services to the flood and drought-affected communities and displaced IDPs in BeletWeyne district amp 5 villages (Gambarlaawe, Jeerey, Beled Salaama, Quracley, Dhariyow)  through carrying out the following:\n1. At the inception, AADSOM will organize community mobilization meetings to the different sectors of the community, local authorities including women, people with disabilities, and minorities to give a good picture of the project deliverables. \n2. Rehabilitating/constructing strategic 30 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps with equal access of men, women, children including people with disabilities and marginalized communities.\n3. Capacity building training of gender shared 30 WASH committees and 60 well operators (2/water source) from the rehabilitated water sources, each WASH committee composing 7 persons (3 women and 4 men), to ensure the sustainability of water sources after the project is faced out.\n4. Construction of 124 gender-sensitive flood-proof latrines to reduce the open defecation practices (11 of the latrines will be accessible with people with disabilities).\n5. AADSOM will train 10 Community Hygiene Promoters on better practices of hygiene and protection/prevention methodologies of Covid-19 to carry out hygiene/covid-19 awareness campaigns. \n6. The trained CHPs will carry out hygiene/covid-19 awareness campaigns to targeted to reach the targeted 15,000 men, women, and children.\n7.

Due to prolonged drought water availability has deteriorated. Since January, extreme water shortages, widespread reliance on water trucking and high-water prices have been reported in most pastoral and agro-pastoral areas The combined impact of drought and floods are likely to exacerbate the already critical food security situation in Somalia. A fifth of the population, up to 2.8 million people are now projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity and hunger2. According to the Somalia Humanitarian Needs Overview 2021, one million children are acutely or severely malnourished. cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) and suspected cholera have spiked in Somalia.  According to OCHA June Bulletin a total of 211 new suspected cases (104 female and 107 male) and five deaths were reported between 31 May to 6 June3, with 145 (68.7 per cent) being children under 5 years of age. The cases were reported from 22 districts in Hirshabelle, South West states and Banadir region. According to South West state MOH/WHO latest report indicated that in 2021 over 700 cases of AWD were reported in Bayhaw CTU in Baidoa. According to the recent assessment conducted by CCCM/WASH cluster and local authority in South West State 1031 households in Baidoa have been displaced to Baidoa town due to insecurity and drought. The actors have also increased their presence along main supply routes, preventing the smooth entry of basic commodities into the town, negatively impacting the livelihoods of local residents and pushing food prices up. On 5 June, the local authority appealed for immediate humanitarian assistance for the new IDPs. Rapid assessments conducted in early June by NGO partners and the WASH, Health and Food Security clusters show that essential needs include emergency latrines and water trucking/access. \nIn the context mentioned above GRRN will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1)Improve access to safe water through extension of  3 water distribution networks to  drought affected settlements/ communities.\n Rehabilitation of 1 strategic borehole water sources and installation of water distribution networks (pipeline extensions, water points installation) at settlements/sites hosting newly displaced populations (communities including persons with disabilities should be consulted on location and designs of water facilities). Rehabilitation of 11 shallow wells with hand pump to provide water to drought affected IDPs in Baidioa. Construction  of  212 new disaster and gender sensitive  communal latrines that are lockable from inside with both hand washing and lighting. 15% of this latrines(32) will targeted people with disabilities  in new settlements hosting newly displaced population. Facilities should be culturally appropriate, safe for users of all ages and gender and accessible to persons with disability - 15% of facilities should be accessible to PWDs.\n Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and 2000 hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary materials). Latrine construction and hygiene promotion activities should be implemented through market based programming to enable the local market. GRRN WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings, WASH Chapter as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guideline. This project will target 15,625 beneficiaries( 7,500 women,5000 men,1,875 girls and 1,250 boys) which 75% of recently displaced IDPs  5% returnees and 20% host communities.",

        "description": "The lack of adequate clean water remains a major indicator of environmental health conditions such as AWD/Cholera that claims many lives and particularly children under the five years of age. The proposed WASH intervention aimed to reach a cumulative total of 13000 beneficiaries (4,290 men, 3,510 women, 2,340 Boys, 2,860 girls) to contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity precipitated by poor access to WASH services in Badhadhe.\nIn Badhadhe most water sources have been contaminated and access to clean water is not a guarantee. To address this, the proposed intervention aims to Rehabilitate 1 strategic borehole with an elevated water tanks and a network of distribution systems in WARAQ to provide clean and sustainable water. 3-Shared water kiosks will be constructed and will be managed by trained Water management committees who will report to the management of the main boreholes. In consultations with the relevant stakeholders including women and PWD, the project will initiate a piping system from the main water sources to the identified and agreed sites for the water kiosk to ensure women and girls do no travel long distance to fetch the water and the path to the facilities are accessible. 16-Non-rehabilitated shallow wells will be chlorinated in RASKAMBONI division.This intervention will enhance water storage capacity through provision of cluster approved jerry cans for household water storage.\nThe project will also ensure that water delivered for use by the IDPs is tested and treated at the source and at the household level through distribution of Aqua tabs. Rehabilitation on the borehole will focus on: replacement of faulty Submersible pump and equipping with appropriate solar pumping systems, elevated water tank and distribution systems that connect to 3 water kiosks. Additionally, there will be provision of borehole consumables and chlorination. This will ensure provision of sustainable and equal delivery of safe water.\nIn consultations with the diverse local community members including women and people living with disability, appropriate measures to address the devastating sanitation situation in the area will be drawn to reverse the conditions. The project envisages to design and construct gender sensitive and culturally appropriate 175 emergency latrines with hand washing facilities in the Hosingo, WARAQ and Kulbiyow locations to eliminate the tradition of open defection and promote better sanitation practices by the target population. 15% of the sanitation facilities will be reserved and designed for people living with disability. 75 sanitation kits will also be provided to the sanitation groups.\nThe proposed intervention will also promote good hygiene practices focusing handwashing with soap through dissemination of hygiene messages at communal and IDP settlements. 10 gender balanced hygiene promoters will be trained on basic hygiene practices, chlorination, proper handling of domestic water, personal health and environmental care. 1800 standard hygiene kits (Sanitary material, 800gram soap, 10 straps of aqua tabs, bucket and 2-20L jerry cans) will be distributed in HOSINGO, WARAQ and KULBIYOW. 800 Kits will be secured from the WASH Cluster hub in Kismayo while the remaining (1,000) including female specific sanitary kits will be secured locally through MBP approach and each HH will secured the Kit through voucher from the local vendor. 1000 Culturally appropriate IEC materials for hygiene, PSEA and COVID-19 will be designed and distributed. To utilize the capacity of the local markets, significant amount of this activities will be implemented through market based approaches including the sourcing of suitable construction company from the local market through market assessment. All actions will be implemented in strict compliance with Ministry of Health's recommendation to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "description": "The WASH project for Adado District is designed to support a total of 16,500 people (2,750 households) rural destitute pastoralists, including 9,464 IDPs (disaggregated by gender), and drought-affected water deficit pastoralists in hard-to-reach areas. The action will improve access to adequate, safe drinking water supply that meets the minimum recommended amount for a household facing emergencies (7.5\u201315 litres per day as per SPHERE Standards). The project's approach is based on WASH cluster recommendations for 2021 where WASH requirements will be based on market programming, allowing the rehabilitation of critical water points to meet the water requirements in identified water deficit IDP and pastoralist households. The project will respond to the currently identified WASH gaps brought by the rising threat of the declared drought in Somalia. Adado District has experienced a poor long rains 2020 season (Gu season) which has created a water deficit now being felt by pastoralists in hard-to-reach areas of the district that rely on water purchased from boreholes. \n\nRehabilitation and upgrading of water infrastructure: The project proposes to rehabilitate 3 strategic boreholes that support rural pastoralist households including being the water source for water vendors who truck the water to the rural areas. These will involve installing a solar power system to ease the gen-sets in use and reduce the cost of abstracting the water in two of the boreholes in Horseed and Xinjalab settlements while increasing the daily total yield (144 CUM per BH).  The project will also increase the water storage capacity by constructing two 60 CUM overhead tanks in the 2 boreholes (i.e. at Biyo Gudud and Xinjalab settlement).  The Berkads are currently used as water storage points for community purchasing water from vendors in the 7 selected settlements during the current drought. The project will provide capacity building for the 15 water management committees through training of 30 members on Operations and Management, and another 54  water point operators on water chlorination (from 3 rehabilitated boreholes, 12  Berkad operators, and additional 12 boreholes targeted only for chlorination). The chlorine will be sourced from UNICEF RSH in Adado Town.  Water testing and quality monitoring shall be undertaken for the duration of the project in all the supported boreholes.  \nSanitation and Hygiene: The project will construct 53 gender and disability latrines for the 5 IDP Camps in Adado District (with 10 latrines being allocated for the PWDs. A total of 25 Hygiene promoters consisting of 10 men and 15 women shall be trained on hygiene and deployed to the 5 targeted IDP Camps. Hygiene promoters' training will aim at creating awareness and elimination of open defecation and promotion of uptake of latrine use within the Camps and improve general hygiene within Adado.  The project will also work with UNICEF Emergency WASH Regional Supply Hub in Adado Town (which CPD manages) to provide hygiene kits to women in the IIDP camps.\n\nThe centrality of Protection: The design of the water infrastructure as done ensures water delivery pipelines to water kiosks for women to collect water near their settlements as opposed to the collection of water at the boreholes as is the current practice. Women and girls shall also be prioritized for protection measures including having designated water collection points and also the planned hygiene kits. The market assessment to be conducted shall ensure to obtain information on the cost of accessing water, sanitation, and hygiene kits proposed that ensures value-for-money and ensure they are not exploited. The MEAL plan to be developed for the project monitoring shall monitor the specific data and information that pertains to protection for women and girls in all the planned project components.\nDisability: The project shall ensure the constructed service points are disabled-friendly, to ease access for disabled persons",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in IDPs and vulnerable and marginalized host communities in undeserved and hard to reach areas within Jowhar district is alarming and require immediate attention. Significant gaps have been reported in flood affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. According to joint assessments conducted by GSA, AV and HIWA in July 2021, the flooding situation in Jowhar district has resulted massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers, elderly and disabled people who are now facing serious drinking water shortage, hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. AS operations remain high and security situation is in unpredictable. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as waterborne diseases which has already been reported in some of the assessed areas. Protection concerns are at alarming rate, there are increasing cases of GBV lack of privacy in IDP\u2019s camps. IDPs lose their property whenever they are evicted women and girls suffer most due to increased exposure to the risk of rape. Serious protection concerns have also been recorded such as sexual violence which was found as the highest ranked, followed by threats from AS, limited freedom of movement, family separations, recruitment of child solders by AS and killings as result of clan issues and conflict. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Jowhar district compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall may result in further deterioration of humanitarian situation. In terms of basic needs, WASH and food has been recognized as the priority need, followed by Shelter and NFIs, Security, Health, Nutrition and Protection. To address the needs stated above, the project aims to save the lives of these floods affected IDPs and vulnerable and marginalized host communities in undeserved and hard to reach areas within Jowhar district by providing immediate life-saving WASH assistance, to enhance resilience and improve the wellbeing of people especially for children, woman and vulnerable groups, such as persons with disabilities in cholera/AWD hotspots and crowded IDP settlements by emergency water supply through construction of 1 strategic boreholes, rehabilitation of 8 shallow wells with chlorination, pipeline extensions and distribution systems, construction of 200 flood proof latrines that consider people with disabilities in IDPs camps and host communities and dissemination of hygiene best practice through IECs with and distribution of hygiene kits and formation and training of WASH committees on the operation and maintenance of the WASH infrastructures. The project will target 19,612 IDPs and flood vulnerable and marginalized people who are living in Tawakal, Jiliyaale, Sheikh Omar, Biaso and Waqwaqley IDPs camps and Geeda Barkan, Gafey, Lamawab and Sabuun villages in Jowhar district. GSA WASH interventions will be implemented in coordination with complementary activities by other organizations targeting the same locations and beneficiaries, where they will cover CCCM, Shelter and protection components. This integrated approach will be useful to create synergies of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact.",

        "description": "In 2020, Somalia had been hit by Multiple threats from Covid-19, locusts, conflict, insecurity, forced evictions, droughts, and flooding. The number of people in need has consistently increased over the last three years, from 4.2 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020 and 5.9 million in 2021 according to the CCCM cluster Acaps review. This is further reflected in the number of displaced people in 2020/2021. 47% of the population of 12.3 million needs some form of humanitarian assistance, including 2.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), with an additional half a million displaced on average per year as a result of climatic conditions and conflict. Most displacement-affected persons face multiple or recurrent displacements, with a majority of IDPs having been displaced at least five times previously and very few return to areas of origin. Post-Gu IPC analysis conducted in September 2020 by FEWSNET and partners, indicates that an estimated 1.7 million people are anticipated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with 0.4 million persons experiencing an emergency (IPC Phase 4). An additional 3.0 million persons are expected to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2), with the current conditions projected to remain unchanged by end of 2020. Projections running into 2021, through May, predict continued Stressed (IPC 2) and Crisis (IPC 3) outcomes to persevere, largely due to continued struggles of affected households to overcome shocks. Households in IDP areas in the Banadir region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by the high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large-scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. Camp coordination and camp management is a relatively a concept that\u2019s limited within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized to this concept. \n\nSCC will implement these activities in 20 IDP sites in Kahda district of Banadir region with over 30,000HHs as per the latest detailed site assessment (DSA), targeting a largely underserved area. Approximately 36000 IDPs (6000 households) will benefit from this proposed intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding, or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys, and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age, and diversity dis-segregated data. SCC will implement this intervention in the Kahda district of Banadir region targeting 6000 HHs. Kaxda District is one of the IDP major hubs in Mogadishu that hosts the largest number of IDPs. Throughout the project, the needs of women, girls, men, and boys of all ages will be addressed throughout the planning, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation of the activities. Through regular site monitoring, needs and gaps will be reported and shared with partners and all stakeholders. Particular attention regarding needs will be paid to women and girls who also have to contend with GBV and protection concerns within camp settings. Through this project, SCC will also address the current and newly identified needs by setting up camp coordination structures at the national and, where necessary, regional or district levels, facilitating and supporting the establishment of effective coordination and management in IDP sites while respecting national context and authorities.",

        "description": "This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 36,000 IDP persons from 40 settlements in Kahda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including enhancing the capacity of camp governance structures and site-level committees to promote information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include organizing site-level coordination meetings among service providers and local authorities to highlight priority needs and challenges, mitigate protection risks and ensure efficient use of existing referral pathways. 10 site-level mobilizers, each serving as a focal point for 4 sites, will be hired from target IDPs to circulate key messages, report on gaps, conduct service mapping, needs and new arrivals, conduct site monitoring and take shelter-level CFM complaints in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address vulnerabilities and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nSite maintenance committees and IDPs in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out. In the selection of cash-for-work beneficiaries, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complaint mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population. Target sites will be prioritized based on vulnerability such as congestion levels, proportion of minority groups, potential exposure to protection risks and overall living conditions. AVORD will utilize cluster tools such as the IDP site risk map or DSA data in the process of site selection. A site-level Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be developed and the project team will ensure that the system is accessible for all populations and that the mechanism is clearly understood and supported by the community.\n\nThe present proposal will complement an interagency program currently being implemented by AVORD and other partners in Banadir to provide WASH and awareness raising services to reduce Covid 19 transmission. Synergies will be developed with these activities to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the resources.",

        "description": "The proposed 12-month intervention will aim to close the gap between crisis-affected children and enrolment as well as retention in schools. This is through improving access to quality education, increase access to critical WASH inputs and enhance child protection mechanisms in 15 schools that are among the priority schools for the education cluster that are at a high risk to close or have closed due to drought in Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. These schools are: Almaamum and Balihoowd primary in Balanbale Cumar Khadaab and Lajide primary in Xeraale Tawakal, Dugsiga H/dhexe and Howlwadhaag primary schools in Abudwak Xananleey, Alma\u2019mun, and Higlaale primary in Dhusamareeb Mucalim Ibrahim and Kobciye IDP primary in Guriceel and Kulmiye IDP, Docoley and Dayax primary in Cadaado. The identified needs in the 15 schools include water shortage, poor state of classroom and WASH facilities, shortage of teaching and learning materials, limited access to dry food rations, low attendance rate of teachers due to lack of incentives, low awareness on child protection reporting mechanisms by students and teachers, poor hygiene in the schools due limited access to clean water for drinking and handwashing. These needs have affected attendance and retention of learners in the 15 targeted schools. The main gaps in delivery of quality education services in the 15 schools include limited capacity of the Ministry of Education to provide the required education services due to budgetary constraints lack of intervention by other education partners due to the remoteness of the school that contributes to inaccessibility and security challenges to operate in these areas recurrent drought and intermittent conflict leading to loss of livelihoods for the communities in the targeted locations. The project will target to directly reach 2,315 learners out of which 1,266 boys and 1,049 are girls, 30 teachers translating to 2 teachers plus 1 head teacher per school, 30 community hygiene promoters and indirectly reach 45 CEC members. Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, water trucking to the schools to ensure a regular supply of water to the schools during drought, construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with community hygiene promoters (CHPs). To ensure inclusion of students with disabilities, child, gender and disability friendly latrines will be constructed with accessibility ramps and door sizes made within the required inclusion standards to enable access by students with disabilities to these facilities. CISP will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by drought and displacement. To ensure centrality of protection in the schools, CISP will assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, appoint and train protection focal points in the schools to strengthen feedback and reporting mechanisms to address protection concerns in the schools., Through engagement with ministry officials such as Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education  MoECHE Gender Focal Points,  the Ministry of Women and Human rights Development MoWHRD Regional Child Protection Coordinator and CECs, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

Further, the intervention proposes to support learner retention, improve learning environment and ensure safety of learners. The intervention has been designed to meet the needs of vulnerable girls, women, boys and men, IDPs and host communities in the three target districts (Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow). In ensuring centrality of protection, the program has been designed to enhance awareness/dissemination of child protection amp safeguarding principles with targeted girls and boys through establishment of leadership networks/clubs/platforms in targeted public schools in Gedo region. The intervention has based a big bulk of its outputs towards supporting IDP children (70%) and children from vulnerable host communities to enroll in permanent functional schools within Gedo, to ensure sustainability. The intervention is designed to build on gains made by the ongoing Education Cannot Wait (ECW) project as well as DFID funded Leave No Girl Behind (LNGB) which targets the same schools and locations, and to leverage and complement on other sectoral interventions in the same schools (WASH, Protection, Health), and will adopt an integrated approach that will focus on drought, protection, COVID-19 prevention and control, and life-saving interventions. In order to ensure access to safe and protective learning environment for vulnerable learners, the intervention shall among other key interventions: construct/rehabilitate TLS, provide safe drinking water hygiene promotion in schools (including COVID-19 prevention and control messaging), distribute sanitary kits to girls, establish school WASH facilities based on need, distribute TLM, pay emergency teacher incentives, provision of school feeding program as well as implementation of child protection activities in line with the education and child protection integrated response framework. The intervention will be implemented in a total of eighteen (18) schools in Gedo Region.

        "description": "The NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO\n\nIn response to, and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed of 4 INGOs: Halo Trust, IRC, INTERSOS, FCA and 1 LNGO SYDAVO), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training and preparation to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support. Information is shared on adhoc basis daily or several time a day as alerts if the security incident requires the immediate action of NGOs and scheduled products are sent every week, every fortnight and every quarter\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor assistants (all INSO staff have their own network to source information as they are very close to the community and in contact with a wide range of local actors), NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 57,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO Training Team runs training programs which targets both individual safety and management of the organization's security. Finally, INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs.\nThe project budget leans heavily in HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "Critical humanitarian needs persist in Somalia across the different livelihood groups whose vulnerabilities continue to worsen due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic and escalating conflict. The poor Deyr rains (October to December 2020) led to the inadequate pasture for livestock, water shortage and below average crop production. The deteriorating food security outlook combined with the worsening malnutrition appeals for a rapid, well-targeted and coordinated scale up of responses to save lives and recovery of livelihoods assets. The project aims to improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihood assets related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages through conditional cash transfers to enhance livelihood opportunities and rehabilitation of water infrastructures and provision of fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in agro-pastoral and pastoral villages in Belet-Hawa district, Gedo region. \nThe project will target 815 vulnerable drought affected agro-pastoral and pastoral households among women, men, boys, girls, including female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The detrimental effects of the current shocks have severely and directly affected rural communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk leading to household food insecurity, increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and livestock use. Additionally, the affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debts. \nCOOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation process, target communities, especially women, girls and the disabled will be included in community representative committees and decision making processes In selection of beneficiaries, registrations, verifications and monitoring exercises so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, conditional cash transfer will be provided to 815 affected household including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services.\nTo restore livelihood assets of households, 815 beneficiaries will engage in cash for work activities construction and/or rehabilitation of water catchments and water harvesting structures (soil bunds), 150 households among the CFW beneficiaries will also be provided with fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in the areas where soil bunds structures have been constructed to regenerate pasture to ensure availability of fodder for livestock. This activity aims at restoring livestock assets of the communities and envisages reducing workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, gender based violence and exploitation malpractices associated with in search of livestock feeds and water for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed activity. In summary the following activities will be carried out:\n1. Provide conditional cash transfer to 815 households in Belet-Hawa district to increase household purchasing power and rehabilitate livelihood assets and water sources.\n2. Support to fodder production through provision of Sudan grass seeds) for 150 affected households in Belet-Hawa district.",

The project will also train selected beneficiaries in improved fodder production and management. The project directly targets mostly under-served individuals and living in hard to reach areas in 5 villages including Badhi Galis Satellite, Bixin, Masle in Ceel Afweyn district and Rag Caddeye, Marwade in Ceerigaabo district all in Sanag region. The target beneficiaries will mainly include women, men, persons with disability, children and the elderly and other vulnerable groups broadly categorized as host communities and IDPs. The project duration is 7 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions. \n\nSpecifically, 239 households (HH) including 235 workers and 4 foremen will receive conditional Cash Transfers. Each of the 235 household/ beneficiary will receive $126 for 3 months/ rounds, while the 4 foremen will be recruited for 54 days and paid a daily rate of $10. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. A PDM will be conducted after the first round of cash transfer to determine level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries. A local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFurthermore, at least 40 households from Bali Gelis and Bixin will be trained in improved fodder production and management and provided with fodder seedlings. In the same villages, 2 fodder shades will be constructed to improve fodder storage. \n\nAlso, 2 berkads will be constructed in 2 villages including Rag Caddeye and Marwade in Ceerigaabo district and 2 dams will be rehabilitated in Rag Caddeye and Masle villages through conditional cash transfer in order to improve community access to water for household and livestock use through rehabilitated water infrastructure. Water catchments (rangelands) will be rehabilitated and reseeded to increase availability of fodder for the animals. \n\nCandlelight has rolled out a mobile phone/ technology beneficiary feedback and complaints mechanism (\u201cfeedback loops\u201d) with a tool free and easy to remember telephone number.

The intervention aims to ensure that lives are saved and human suffering is reduced through provision of food security production inputs to targeted beneficiaries in order to ensure immediate access to inputs and subsequently to food for the most vulnerable populations. Due to the Current biting  droughts , this project  will target a total of 650 HHs approximately 3,900(585 men, 975women, 1,170 boys and 1,170 girls in drought affected people in Garowe. Female-headed HHs and young adolescents girls will constitute approximately 60% of beneficiary households. This weighting towards female-headed households is because they are considered more vulnerable due to their restricted options for paid labor. Once a household has been identified as a beneficiary, the project will primarily target women and who have lost livelihoods as result of water shortages within the households to receive  cash for work vouchers by rehabilitating harvesting structures and Berked  as result of the water shortage, Women have been targeted as beneficiaries since they typically make household food purchases and determine meal distribution within the household. Furthermore, The proposed project will target those households in the most critical situations. Not all households are at the same level of destitution or crisis. There are, for example, some households that do not have productive assets but receive remittances from relatives abroad. Beneficiary identification and selection will be managed by KAALO and facilitated by the existing  villages and elder Committees (CRCs), which are comprised of IDPs leaders, community elders and key stakeholders\nCriteria for targeting is as follows: priority will be given to recently displaced (within the past year) female headed HHs, HHs with vulnerable members including pregnant women, children lt5, elderly, sick and/or disabled persons. Individual households (both IDP and local community) will be targeted and selected based on established criteria for vulnerability as mentioned above. \n\n1.\tRehabilitation of two water catchment to immediately access to cash for work to 300 HHs for 2 months , These will be constructed during selected months to enable over 1800 beneficiaries (300HHs) including men, women, boys and girls (gt18 years of age) get Cash for work to cover food. KAALO will distribute 100 sets of hand tools per village for two locations.

        "description": "The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2021 and the 1st 2021 SHF Standard Allocation for Food Security and Livelihoods that will respond to acute water shortages in Galkayo South (Mudug region), which are experiencing pre-drought conditions.\n\nThe Project will improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihoods related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages occasioned by pre-drought conditions, conflicts and impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nThe Project targets an estimated 706HH (4,236 people) assessed to be in acute food insecurity, \u2018Crisis\u2019 and \u2018Emergency\u2019 phases of IPC (3 and 4) by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and water support. The project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 662 unskilled labourers and 44 semi-skilled labourers rehabilitating 9 Water Pans in 9 settlements in Galkayo South. Each of the 662 unskilled labourers shall get $6 per day while each of the 44 semi-skilled labourers will work at the rate of $8 per day:- Daily work output per person per day as per the Somalia CWG standards is 1.585M3 ( 5hours* 0.317M3). The total number of working days is 25 for each water pan, However, they will be rehabilitated in different months to allow for prudent supervision, monitoring and evaluation and reporting by the project team. The nine water pans to be rehabilitated are 1. Gaarcad, 2. Dhagfaruuryaale, 3. Cinjirre, 4. Laamawayne, 5. Rasan, 6. Balicadde, 7. Xaarxaar, 8. Qooraseyn, 9.Biyogaduud.\n\nThe project will specifically prioritise destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the four Districts). The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains and Desert locust infestation leading to inadequate pasture, water resources and below-average crop production in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below-average rainfall for the coming Gu 2021 season as indicated by FEWSNET/FSNAU in its February to September 2021 update. \n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries, ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project activities to ensure it provides women the safety and protection required. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. \n\nCPD plans to use the first 2 months of the project to undertake household vulnerability assessment in the identified locations within South Mudug, undertake community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration for the Conditional Cash Transfers beneficiaries captured in KoboConnect. The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). The rehabilitation works involving excavation of water pans to required provided dimensions will be done across 3 months for the 9 sites in Galkayo South of Mudug region. Payments to the unskilled and semi-skilled labourers will be made through Mobile Money Transfer once the scheduled work is completed. The project will carry out post-distribution monitoring in the final month of the project.",

Specifically, this nutrition program will promote access to quality care, adequate nutrition, and encourage healthier behaviors to optimize the communities\u2019 resilience to future nutrition emergencies. \nMercy-USA for Aid and Development, in partnership with the MoH, will continue to address the nutrition challenges by implementing the integrated package in 2 fixed facilities in Karan district and 2 fixed facilities and 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team) in Yaqshid district in Banadir region.\nFacility and community-based Basic Nutrition Services Package (BNSP) will cover both curative and preventative interventions targeting children under 5 years old (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women.\nMercy-USA will ensure that the nutrition sites will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff, and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. \nMercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and offer refresher trainings to staff.\nThis program will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support, and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. \nScreening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programs. \nAccording to IMAM guidelines, children in the nutrition program will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anemia if required.

ANPPCANSOM emergency response plan will scale up treatment of malnutrition and reach an estimated caseload of 1,407 SAM representing 50% of the nutrition cluster SAM burden of 2,806 in Lasanod District. \nThe project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from moderate and severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the Lasanod Stabilization Center run by MSF using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will support and manage 3 health centers (Tuulo Samakaab, Halhaliye, Dan )and 2 mobile teams  covering 20 remote sites (Biriqodey, Bixin, Burowadal, Buulal, Fardhidin, Gacandar, Garac Lagu Dhal, God Qaboobe, Higlo Fiqi, Faleeryale  Canjiid, Laas Magugle, Jidbaale, Kalax, Sango Jabiye, Karin Dabayl, Saha Gebogebo, Buq-Xaar, Adhicadeeye, Akuule) within Lasanod district. \nIn order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCHs. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somalia Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to the target communities including internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach in Lasanod district areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project. \nThe project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. \n\nIn order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.\nLikewise, the project will give particular emphasis on the current COVID-19 pandemic prevention measure to contain the spread of the virus. Gender and protection activities will be effectively mainstreamed into the project. Every effort will be made to ensure equity and to reach the most vulnerable population in Lasanod District.",

        "description": "FSNAU 2020 post Deyr assessment indicates both GAM and SAM are serious with aggravating factors.  Food security is expected to worsen. The poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains led to the inadequate pasture, water resources and below average crop production. Weather predictions point towards a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall from April to June due to the La Nina effect. \nThe key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional and stable health system. Tied to that is scarce availability of health professionals and poor community literacy levels (UNICEF 2019 OCHA 2020). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease. \nServices in Dhobley barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure . Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2020SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2021).  Water shortage has already been reported in Dhobley with population displaced due to water shortage. This is expected to get worse if the predicted La Nina manifests next month (OCHA, 2021)\nWomen and children urgently need integrated services targeting prevention and treatment of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition.  WRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project by WFP that focuses on treatment of moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM) and maternal, child health and nutriton (MCHN) at health facilities . These services have not integrated treatment of  severe acute malnutrition (SAM) therefore children with SAM  are left untreated and so at risk of death. WFP funded project also lacks key primary prevention interventions like Micro nutrient supplementation for children 6-59 months and PLW, de worming and IYCF support. Integrating these services will  contribute to significant reduction in prevalence of malnutrition and related mortality.\nThe project will apply the grant strategy and help achieve cluster objective 2 of providing life saving interventions especially for those affected by drought like conditions. It focuses on scaling up and fully integrating nutrition interventions that will ensure full treatment of acute malnutrition.The proposed project will link to SHF's 2021 allocation strategy, the fund's strategic objectives and cluster specific objectives. We hope this will bring down the effects of the prevailing triple threat of COVID 19, floods and Desert Locusts , in addition to the most recent predicted La Nina, on acute malnutrition state. \nWRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project funded by WFP that covers treatment of Moderate acute malnutrition, MCHN and a relief project. The proposed project will bring in treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition thus ensuring full treatment of acute malnutrition at one stop. Beneficiaries will not be referred to other facilities and/or partners, which sometimes complicates treatment by increasing defaulters. This project will also support primary prevention interventions not covered by WFP project, which are very vital. These will include Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) support and micro nutrient supplication for both children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). This proposed project seeks to scale up and integrate treatment of acute malnutrition through a fixed site in Dhobley,being in a health facility. which will of will offer TSFP for treatment of MAM,OTP for treatment of  uncomplicated SAM and Stabilization center for treatment of complicated SAM, all these with prevention interventions. There will also be 1 mobile team to cover IDP  and hard to reach rural areas with treatment of MAM and uncomplicated SAM integrating  prevention interventions.",

        "description": "According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2020/ technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated. In Ceelwaq nutrition situation of district continues to deteriorate further with limited humanitarian assistance. Post day 2020 released by FSNAU in Februar 2021 indicated that a chronic high level of acute malnutrition in Elwak district. The target areas have many challenges contributing to acute malnutrition particularly rural areas where access is constrained. The Desert Locust has caused significant damage to 2020 pastures and grassing land for livestock\u2019s which the backbone liveliho of communities in Ceelwaq. The latest forecasts indicate that Desert Locust continues to pose a very high risk to rural livelihoods across Somalia in 2021, potentially exacerbating the impact of the anticipated below-average 2021 Gu rains. The Nutrition Cluster estimates caseloads of about 300 SAM and 2120 MAM annually in the Ceelwaq district with an estimated population of about 30,689 population PESS. HDC is an active nutrition/health partner and currently implementing EAC simplified protocol in partnership with UNICEF as well HIV-Global fund emergency health in Ceelwaq general hospital, Dhamasa and Hosqurun MCHs in Ceelwaq district. In Decembe 2020, UNICEF emergency projects, Covid 19, emergency primary health and implementation of the expanded admission criteria of acute malnutrition to the outpatient therapeutic program EAC that supported health and nutrition intervention in Ceelwaq district implemented by HDC came to a end. This left a gap in health and nutrition in three-way district. The Proposed project will therefore bridge the major essential nutrition service gap that currently exists in Ceelwaq following the ended UNICEF and HDC PD out of the integrated health and nutrition Project. The project will address the identified gaps in nutrition, enhancing access to nutrition services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations. These specific needs have been outlined in the HRP and FSNAU and UNOCHA mulita cluster need rapid assessment gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. HDC will work with MOH-Federal, JSS-MOH to address the nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls, and persons living with physical disabilities in the targeted district. 2 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated and hard to reach populations in Ceelwaq district. Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with MAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be referred to HDC Managed district hospital supported by UNICEF before but still functional supporting by HDC. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the SCs that HDC propose to support in Ceelwaq district hospital and Damase referral health center in Ceelwaq district. However, we are facing a shortage of funding to sustain the existing nutrition services. Through this project, HDC is planning to maintain and support the existing nutrition services (2 fixed OTP, 1 stabilization center in the Ceelwaq general hospital with integration of health projects and one mobile teams into reaching 6 villages comprising IDPs and Hard to reach rural population mostly affected by crises in Elwak district. This nutrition intervention will build on HDC's ongoing emergency nutrition and health interventions in high risks areas in Ceelwaq district and will support the continuation of essential life-saving treatment in the context of COVID and other ongoing outbreaks in line with IMAM guideline.",

It is also designed to increase access to information and specialised services, which displaced communities required to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of their HLP and other rights. This will also entail identifying pressing capacity gaps and supporting state institutions and administrative structures to systematically address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion in target communities.\n\nThe proposed action builds on NRC\u2019s hands-on expertise in HLP programming in Somalia, and targeting 4030 households in Kismayo, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced affected communities HLP rights and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of long-lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities to reduce the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthen tenure security among displaced communities at the highest risk of eviction, and consolidate the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include the following:\n-\tprovision of reliable and up-to-date information and specialised services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights \n-\texpanding access to tenure security through documentation and technical support monitoring and mapping of evictions trends \n-\tsupporting the Kismayo Evictions Taskforce to lead in evictions response and programming and helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash \n-\tstrengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities\n-\tprovision of legal counselling, assistance and representation \n-\tcapacity-building trainings for rights holders, decision-makers and duty bearers on HLP and\n-\tadvocacy and undertaking comprehensive assessments and surveys, leading to the development of action plans and informing planned relocations.\n\nThe centrality of Housing, Land and Property (HLP) assistance is a key component to achieving lasting durable solutions for Displacement Affected Communities (DACs). Sustainable (re)integration remains unattainable without securing access to land, improving security of tenure and reducing the threat of evictions. Against this backdrop, there are multiple challenges linked to accessing HLP rights by DACs that exist. The HLP challenges are created by repeated, protracted displacement in urban areas exacerbated by the high demand (in the context of rapid urbanisation, investment and development) and skyrocketing land prices. This has been compounded by competing claims on land coupled with limited legal and policy frameworks around HLP rights, inadequate technical and functional capacities of state institutions, and weak mechanisms for resolving HLP disputes. Besides, DACs lack knowledge of their HLP rights and how to exercise them, and women\u2019s access to HLP rights is adversely affected due to discriminatory customs.",

        "description": "Since the beginning of 2020, additional shocks, extensive floods, desert locust infestations, the COVID-19 pandemic and drought have had compounding effects, further deteriorating already compromised systems and gains that had already been made in the economy. The secondary impacts have impacted directly the well-being of children with the rise of negative coping mechanisms being witnessed and reported such as rise in child marriage, psychological distress, sexual violence and other harmful practices. According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview (2021) children and adolescents in Somalia are targets of killing, maiming and abduction, recruitment into armed groups, detention, sexual and physical violence. Boys are at an elevated risk of recruitment to armed groups. The actual extent of grave violations of children\u2019s rights is higher than what is reported and verified. Separated and unaccompanied children are at heightened risk of various forms of violence, exploitation and abuse. While some have been placed into alternative care arrangements, a large number live alone or in the street. COVID-19 and the drought situation has stretched the foster families providing alternative care to the children. The Child Protection AoR assessment in 2020 carried out among partners also reported that children were expressing aggressive behaviors which point out to psychological distress stemming from the dire living conditions at home. IA recent study conducted by WVI in Luuq and other neighboring districts revealed that the market places, water points were some of the places identified by both IDPs and host communities as unsafe for children. The major child protection concerns identified during this study included child labour, child marriage, school dropout and sexual violence. These results are   corroborated by the education cluster reports that indicated that children are out of school in Gedo region as a result of drought with about 6000 primary school children affected. This project has been designed to respond to these needs through risk mitigation and prevention of violations of children rights and addressing child protection needs through case management. Leveraging on already existing health, WASH and Food and Cash Assistance projects in Luuq, this project\u2019s interventions have been designed to synergize efforts to deliver well-coordinated interventions to address the child protection needs. This presence of WVI staff in Luuq and the existing connection with community structures already provides registered vulnerable people groups for this project to build on. Prevention of violations and risk mitigation through a community led process has been factored including capacity building plans for self-protection among the children and their care givers. Awareness raising on the child protection and equipping of care givers with positive parenting skills is provided for to ensure children associated with armed forces and armed groups are safely re-integrated within their households and community.  To increase access to specialized child protection services either directly or through referral, update and dissemination of the referral pathway is one of the key intervention planned for to raise awareness among service providers and the community for quick and timely response. Provision for MHPSS at individual and group level has been created to meet the needs of children across different ages. Home visits will be facilitated by the care givers to meet the needs of children with disability to ensure they are not left out. Child Friendly Spaces as a measure for MHPSS has also been included in the project. COVID-19 control measures of hand washing and provision of masks for the children will be done. Screening before admission will also be done with the CFS being equipped with thermometers. Through these activities, 1300boys, 1650girls, 850men, 1100 women and 354 of persons with disability 50M,60W,122B and122G will be reached.",

        "description": "The situation of people affected by displacement and disasters remains precarious with respect to physical safety and dignity. As a result of destitution, women, men, girls and boys, are exposed to particular and various forms of violence, exploitation and discrimination. Frequent protection risks reported on the ground include (i) GBV, (ii) forced evictions, (iii) exposure to explosive hazards and (iv) child rights violations, such as child recruitment by armed groups and early marriage. Displacement increases the risk of family separation, and currently, there is an estimated caseload of 8,000 unaccompanied or separated children in Somalia. Furthermore, due to the loss of men\u2019s livelihoods, displaced women are increasingly taking on the role of breadwinners, which exposes them to the increased risk of domestic violence.\nIn a country where violence has been ongoing since 1991, persons with disabilities face extreme hurdles in being recognized, accessing resources and feeling valued in their community. This is particularly true for children and women with disabilities. Persons with disabilities in Somalia are side-lined in every aspect of humanitarian response and are being denied their economic, social and cultural rights. Reports show that persons with disabilities in Somalia are often denied access to water, food, sanitation and accommodation through lack of explicit inclusion\nAccordingly, Somalia marginalized minority communities are facing disaster human and humanitarian situation, extreme poverty and hunger which can lead is causing slow collective death, as members of these communities, especially women youth and children are suffer most from various forms human rights abuse, social and economic deprivation, including hunger and malnutrition, inadequate healthcare, limited access to education, and low self-esteem etc. Due to the above reasons, the minorities are the neediest group of people facing worst starvation, highest poverty rates, massive displacement, huge unemployment figures, highest illiteracy levels and horrific health and sanitation status. Unlike other clans from dominant groups, minorities lack international support due the prolonged Somali conflict which creates an environment where minority groups are vulnerable and abnormally displaced from their homes. Therefore, they suffer grievous human rights violations, which included extra judicial killings, appropriation of lands and properties, and forced displacement from their lands to IDP or refugee camps situated along the Somalia Ethiopia border. \nPopulation estimates indicate that of the 9.3 million people in Somalia, over 400,000 (4.3% of the population) are aged 60 or over.4 Nearly half the population 3.7 million people are now in crisis. Amongst them are approximately 160,000 people aged 60 and over (UNHCR) Practices and approaches that neither recognize their potential nor incorporate their needs place older men and women in a vulnerable situation. Older people\u2019s vulnerabilities stem from lack of opportunities, services and exclusion. There is also growing feminization of the older population as women outlive men leaving many widowed older women. However, gender bias and discrimination can place older women in a very vulnerable situation with few projects targeting older women. Whilst many of the challenges faced by older persons are also faced by other community members, for instance water storage, collection of firewood and limited opportunities for livelihoods, the implications of these challenges can be much greater for older men and women, due to age-related vulnerabilities.",

Interventions will be implemented jointly by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and Horn of Africa Peace Network (HAPEN), NoFYL and SEDHURO. DRC will implement both general protection and WASH components. While HAPEN will implement Shelter/NFI components, NoFYL will implement CCCM and HLP components while SEDHURO will carry out the Child Protection component. DRC and HAPEN had originally entered into a teaming agreement for the implementation of project but with the approval of NoFYL and SEDHURO as implementation partners, active collaboration and coordination with the two organizations will be explored. The integrated approach by the 4 organizations, will create synergies, utilize agency expertise and community networks to access and provide adequate and quality services to the most vulnerable members of the community. \n\n\nThe proposed DRC intervention is designed to contribute to the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the efforts to address the needs of most vulnerable displacement affected communities with a focus on Belet Xaawo district, Gedo region which is a key location targeted by SHF allocation strategy in 2021. The intervention will promote Protection as a central part of programming and will incorporate continuous awareness creation, analysis of protection risks, training amp follow up for effective implementation in line with the Centrality of Protection Strategy 2020-2021 adopted by the HCT in June 2020. Specifically, the project will strengthen the protection of most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men affected by climatic shocks, conflict and COVID-19 by reducing risks and vulnerabilities and increasing community capacities. It will also address needs exacerbated by the ongoing pre-drought conditions as a result of poor rainfall, impact of floods in 2020 and the ongoing locust infestation. The project will employ participatory and community-based and right based approaches as well as age, gender, diversity and inclusion to ensure vulnerable communities receive adequate and quality responses. Key interventions will include protection monitoring and assessments, strengthening of existing referral pathways. Community based mechanisms will be strengthened to prevent and respond to protection concerns. \n\n\nWASH activities will focus on both immediate and sustainable intervention that include improved access to safe water. DRC will carry out rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures, construction of new water infrastructures, water trucking, establishment of gender balanced water management committees, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects, installation of new sanitation facilities (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) in settlements hosting newly displaced population and hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.)\nThe project will target to reach 30,000 individuals\u2019 people (7000 men, 8000, women, 7000 boys, 8000 girls).",

Besides construction of 50 Transitional Shelters, 575 HHs will also be supported in Baidoa through provision of locally purchased Non-Food Items (NFIs) through cash, provision of 575 Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) to the same HHs through cash, settlement (re)planning training to reduce congestion, overcrowding and provide dignified living to beneficiaries. \n\nIn order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in Baidoa and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called 'Kobo Tool box' to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with 'Do No Harm' principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $213 (80% or $170 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $43 as the second installment) for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . Beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . This criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use monitoring and evaluation (MampE) tools, that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. Thus, in total, 625 HHs (575 through ESK, 575 through NFIs and 50 HH through Transitional Shelters) or 3,750 individuals (50% females) will be assisted in Baidoa through this project. A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash, impact of the response and to generate lessons learned for future programming. Similarly, for the transitional shelters, a post construction monitoring exercise will be conducted after 3 month of the construction completion.",

The camps have been selected on the basis of need, high proportion of the newly arrived, lack of similar support and accessibility. The needs of the beneficiaries have been identified through a joint rapid needs assessment conducted by HAPEN and DRC in March 2021.\n\nThe target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) are living in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that compromise their privacy, physical security and protection from weather extremes. The families lack adequate access to NFIs, having lost them during displacement.\n\nHAPEN will distribute Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) and non-food items (NFI) kits to 2333 households, including 230 host households who are equally vulnerable in the interest of Do-No Harm principle and in support of reintegration. An owner-driven approach in the construction of shelters where beneficiaries are assisted and capacitated to undertake the construction. The process will enable them to undertake basic repairs using local materials or rebuild their shelters in future, thus contributing to sustainability of the benefits beyond the project period. On monitoring, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution of NFIs and ESKs respectively. The exercises will provide beneficiary feedback on project effectiveness and will target 90% of the beneficiaries to ensure proper representation and accuracy.\n\nTo ensure accountability, HAPEN will establish community response and feedback mechanisms (CRFM) in the targeted sites. This will be comprised of a CRFM desk and a hotline to offer a channel for beneficiaries to register concerns. \n\nHAPEN will work closely with local administration to plan distribution points, schedules and instill order during the exercises to minimize protection risks. The timing and locations of all distributions will put the safety of women, girls, boys, elderly, disabled and those with limited mobility into consideration. Distribution exercises will be done within reasonable daylight hours. Distances to distribution sites and facilities provided by the project will be minimal and safe. It will be made clear that support provided by the project will be at no cost to the beneficiaries, hence no favours should be solicited from beneficiaries. COVID-19 prevention measures will be observed at all points where project requires beneficiaries, leaders or partners to gather. In general, the project will address protection risks and inclusion of women, disabled and minorities at all stages.\n\nCommunity structures including project community committees will play key roles in decision making, implementation and monitoring of activities and will be comprised of men, women and representatives of the disabled and the minority. \n\nIn particular, this project will closely coordinate and harmonize with Protection, WASH, CCCM and Housing, Land amp Property (HLP)  interventions to be implemented by other partners (DRC, SEDHURO and  NOFYL)  in the same district or camps and in general all other initiatives in the district to ensure complementarity. Under the coordination arrangements, organizations implementing different projects will plan together and share information during the selection of beneficiaries to avoid duplication.",

        "description": "In the context of protracted humanitarian crisis in Somalia where 3 million people are in need of shelter assistance, AVORD is submitting this proposal  to contribute to improved living conditions in Banadir. The target group will be carefully selected from protracted and newly arrived IDPs in overcrowded settlements at-risk of Covid 19 outbreak. Special priority will be accorded to households in deplorable shelter conditions, the evicted, those who have lost household items and shelter due to disasters, persons with disabilities, female headed households and people from marginalized groups. \n\nUnder the proposed initiative, 1,120 kit-based Non-Food Items (NFIs) will be distributed to 1,120 households (6,720 persons) in Banadir. In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain core items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Disbursement of relief items will be need-based, and will be decided in close coordination with the Shelter Cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In addition to NFIs, 1,120 registered households (6,720 will also receive emergency shelters. To ensure complementarity, the same group who received the NFIs will receive the emergency shelters. Site planning will be an integral part of the shelter development process, thus ensuring that adequate separation between individual households exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. Before construction of emergency shelters, AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years.   \n\nFull beneficiary details including name, settlement and contact information will be captured to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. A Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in Banadir where AVORD is implementing other programs, and with other humanitarian partners to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

Overall, the rainfall was below average in most parts of the country with adverse impact on replenishment of water sources.\n\n4.6 million people remain in need of humanitarian WASH assistance in Somalia in 2021 with 2.5 million of them facing acute need of water and sanitation services (FSNAU Technical Release, February 2021). Poor performance of short rains (Oct-Dec) caused water shortages in Sool, Sanaag and South Central Somalia causing displacement of pastoral communities. Of the people in need and highly vulnerable, a large percentage are children, women and the elderly, who critically lack access to clean water and are acutely at risk of gender-related violence and high morbidity and mortality due to water-borne disease outbreaks. Many households lack access to adequate sanitation leading to frequent open defecation while safety of people, particularly women and children to access latrines and water points remains a serious concern and a serious risk for exposure to violence.\n\nACTED will therefore respond to this augmented risks and crisis through a WASH and market based intervention in Lascanod district, Sool region. Through this intervention, ACTED will reach a total of 3,001 households (18,010 individuals) in the proposed area of intervention. In order to create synergies and ensure sequencing, layering and integrating of programming, ACTED will complement the proposed intervention with a current USAID-BHA integrated programme in the target areas. \n\nACTED will respond to the aggravated risk through a comprehensive WASH intervention in eight hard to reach villages in Lascanod district, Sool region.

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Somalia is deteriorating due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflict About 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, an increase from the 5.2 million reported in 2020. Up to 2.7 million people are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse and will face acute food insecurity through mid-2021. An estimated 840,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, 143,000 of them severely and at risk of death. According to Somalia HNO for 2021 the protracted crisis in Somalia, compounded by COVID-19, floods and droughts, has resulted in massive challenges in meeting the WASH needs of the Somali population. According to the JMCNA, approximately 8.9 million people are affected by poor WASH conditions. For 2021, it is estimated that 4.6 million people are in catastrophic (10 per cent), severe (9 per cent) or extreme (18 per cent) need of humanitarian WASH assistance. The 10 per cent of households in catastrophic need mainly face a lack of access to water both in terms of quality and quantity, accompanied by a lack of access to functional sanitation. It is also a cause of relapse for acute diarrheal diseases when treated patients and children return to their communities with limited safe water and sanitation coverage, resulting in limited sustainability of health programs.\nAccording to assessment conducted by BTSC in Nov,2020 findings revealed that majority of the households (63.3%) use unsafe water from a water catchment or a dam as their primary source for drinking water and the said dam has dried up and the cost of 200 litters of water is currently costing between $3-$4 US Dollars which is not affordable to the drought affected communities. Additionally, 43.5% of sampled households do not treat drinking water. The assessment also revealed that only 45% of the resident do have access to latrines and 98% of those latrines are not accessible to people with disabilities. only 37.5% of the assessed families reported to have access to soap.\nIn the context mentioned above GRRN will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1)Improve access to safe water through water trucking to 10,000 drought affected population in priority sites /settlements/ communities targeting in Bay(Burhakaba). Rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures one borehole and 6 shallow wells with hand pump. (2) Construction of water infrastructures including construction of tanks and distribution networks, hybrid solar water pumping system in Burhakaba Borehole (Site selection should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions). (3)Establishment of gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity` of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects.(4) construction of 60 latrines in settlements (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) hosting new displaced population. (5) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and 1,500 hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes) accompanied by robust hygiene promotion activities. GRRN WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings, WASH Chapter as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. The total beneficiaries targeted in this project are 14,000(6,720 women, 4,480 men, 1,680 girls and 1,120 boys) in Burhakaba.",

Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood followed by drought in the Jalalaqsi district to 15,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved and/or hard to reach communities from 5 villages under Jalalaqsi namely Doondheere, Raafey, Habar robe, Cadiley, Sheeloow, Dirggoys east, Buulo Barwaaqo, Baqdaad east and Jalalaqsi town. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project are the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) for a period of 45 days. (Site of the distribution selection by the women/girls should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions).\n\n- Construction of 5 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps in 5 villages in Jalalaqsi district, (Baqdad east, Dirgoys east, Raafey, Dondheere, and Bulo Barwaaqo) with special consideration on disabled and child-friendly accessibility.\n- Upgrade one borehole in Jalalaqsi town (Amaana Borehole) Howlwadaag section of Jalalaqsi town, equipped with the hybrid system including rehabilitation of existing water tank, construction of water kiosk for human use, Construction of engine room, and piping network.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 6 WASH committees and 12 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting.\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. nevertheless, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion compounded with covid-19 awareness campaigns to reach 15,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health, and feeding centers. \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out. \n-Distribute 500 HP kits to 500 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 58 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods to the most affected community including 5 latrines especially constructed for disabled people.\nTo  strengthen the local markets-Based Programming (MBP) approach AADSOM will ensure that:\n- The service providers should be selected locally if available.\n- The contracted service providers should purchase the required material and equipment in the local market if available.\n- The contracted service provider should hire skilled and skilled workers from the local people.",

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s prolonged humanitarian crisis is characterized by ongoing conflicts, climate-related shocks, communicable disease outbreaks, and weak social protection mechanisms. Since the beginning of 2020, three additional shocks have contributed to a deterioration of humanitarian conditions: Extensive floods, Desert Locust infestations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These compounding shocks have exacerbated humanitarian needs among a population already living under the strain of widespread poverty and decades of armed conflict and insecurity. Climate change continues to be a major contributing factor to displacement and food insecurity in Somalia.\nIncreasingly erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions and floods, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Flooding displaced 919,000 people in 2020 and destroyed essential infrastructure, property, and 144,000 hectares of agricultural land. a serious lack of access to clean water and sanitation is heightening the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases exacerbating existing fragilities, especially where health services are too few and/or too distant. In this project, ARD is aimed to improve access to WASH services for Ceelberde IDPs, host communities with recognition of people of disabilities, and the most vulnerable population through the provision of safe water drinking with water vouchers for 60 days period,. Construction/rehabilitation of 22 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps, benefiting around 11,000 (2500 men, 5700 women, 1400 girls, and 1400 boys) crisis-affected IDPs and host communities will be under taken. ARD will also construct 50 flood-resistant latrines to benefit residents in the Ceelberde IDP sites which will also receive the clean water and hygiene promotions and hygiene kits. Approximately, 10% of the 50 latrines (corresponding to 5) will be preserved for people with disabilities living in the target locations. A total of 2500 (500 men, 1500 women, 250 girls, and 250 boys) people will benefit from access to the sanitation, 1000 Households will benefit from hygiene kit distribution and hygiene awareness, Chlorination of wells and WASH committees will be established in addition, carry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Ceelberde district,",

        "description": "Apart from the other layers of hazards existing in the target areas, COVID-19 had also impacted small scale farmers. It has been reported many farmers have abandoned their farming and sought an alternative source of income from the nearby towns. This has increased and exposed the farmers to the risk of COVID 19. \nA.\tFood security of poor farmers through revitalizing agricultural production in the targeted areas. Through cash for work, irrigation canal will be rehabilitated, and farm inputs will be supplied.  The rehabilitation work will be on excavating (desilting) of flood damaged canals.  This will improve the accessibility and availability of water for irrigation uses. Two canals with dimension of 2m width and 1m depth and 2km length will be rehabilitated. Each canal will provide water to 10 farms. In addition to this, the farmers will receive an improved seed such as maize, sesame, tomatoes and pumpkins.  Availing water and seeds to farmers will improve their farm activities and reduce the risk of seeking labour to unsafe environments. In doing this the farmers will start producing by themselves and subsequently able to both feed their families and sell their produce. The project will link to farmers to the existing potential markets through establishing a network between agriculture traders and target farmer groups.  This activity will be done for 15 days by 200 farmers at a rate of $5 per day. Each farm will be distributed with farm equipment\u2019s worth $200\n\nB.\tIncreased employment opportunity through VSLA and income generating activities:  As COVID 19 had mostly impacted poor and vulnerable people who were dependent on market activities such as labour, aid and family support. In the first phase, the project had transferred cash to maintain the minimum food basket for target households.  The cash had supported families to sustain their livelihoods in specific periods of the project. In order to move to an early socio-economic recovery, on the second phase, the project intends to transition from short term cash transfer to more sustainable income generating activities.  The project will introduce a village, saving and loans association approach (VSLA) to improve access to financial resources for poor households, targeting women in priority. The primary purpose of a VSLA is to provide simple savings and loan facilities and through these and other enabling activities empower women to manage resources and invest them for the benefit of their household. Loans can provide a form of self- insurance to members, supplemented by a saving fund which provides small but important income to members in distress. The VSLA system enables members of a self-selected group to voluntarily save money through purchasing shares. The savings are then invested in a loan fund from which members can borrow as well as meet their immediate needs such as food, water and health care or make further investments to diversify and increase their incomes. The project will support 15 VSLA groups of 15 \u2013 20 members with initial seed fund of 3000 USD for each group. The activity will start with community mobilization, selection of households to participate and group formation. While the methodology is simple, it depends on a very carefully structured system of training. Over seven sessions, groups learn to: form their associations; define a purpose; elect officials; design their system of savings, insurance and credit; and practice running savings and credit meetings. Once this process is completed, VSLAs can begin to save and to lend. They are supervised over a period of 12 months by field staffs who ensure procedures and systems work properly and that the groups can function independently thereafter;\n\nC.\tHealth: Strengthened capacity of existing health facilities and services to combat Covid-19. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to 3 health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections. Other activities also include procurement of medicines, community mobilization outreach and training of frontline health workers. IR will also work with the government hospitals and other unit of covid-19 task force in the preparation of covid roll-out. IR will support through advocacy and media outreach for people to accept and take the vaccines. This approach of advocacy, lobbying through media and electronic information sharing will enable the roll-out of vaccines. IR will also use its health facilities as centre for passing information to patients and their dependents to take up vaccines once its made available. Similarly, IR will by making available a vehicle and a driver support the ministry of health with logistics mainly in Balaad, Baidoa and Bandar districts.\n\nD.\tWASH: The project will expand water points in IDPs. In some IPDs for instance Dayniile district, the accessibility of water stands for handwashing is still very small. The water point will allow beneficiaries to easily access water points for handwashing in their proximity.  The expansion will include laying out of pipes and construction of fenced water points. The expansion will improve the sanitation and hygiene of IDP communities so that they can prevent from themselves the spread of COVID 19 pandemic. The water points will be placed in strategic position such as schools and health centres. Additionally, IR will construct water tanks, piping system, training of water committee with a view to make water available for covid-19 prevention. \n\nE.\tProtection: Since there is a prevailing reports of incidence of gender based violence, early marriage, the project will carry out an awareness sessions including training of women and men. These sessions will be in line with Islamic Relief Somalia safeguarding and protection principles.",

        "description": "The key objective is to implement preventative measures for vulnerable groups that have limited access to COVID-19 prevention and response actions. This is to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in urban IDP settings. The intervention will focus on the most vulnerable groups: older people \u2013 forming approximately 2.7 per cent of the population and the urban poor and IDPs about 75% of the population. Assessments shows these as most vulnerable who are heavily impacted by COVID-19 infection. For this response, IRS seeks to complement the efforts of the government and other humanitarian organisation in Somalia by reaching approximately 40,000 beneficiaries directly and up to 200,000 indirectly.\n1. Risk communication and community engagement. The proposed project will support preventative measures to combat the spread of COVID 19. This will include extensive awareness initiatives using multiple media channels to support preventative action of the government and communities. The information/ education and communication is designed to reach the population  through print, audio-visual media messages, SMS and community mobilisation using religious/community/group leaders and elders. Display monitors on COVID 19 risks and prevention in local language will be installed at strategic locations such as roundabouts, airports and community centres in IDP camps.\n2.  Health: Strengthen existing health facilities in the selected IDP camps to combat COVID 19 infection. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to seven health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will also set up and equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections.\n3. WASH: Reduce the spread of COVID 19 and decrease morbidity and mortality in the selected districts. The project improve hygiene practices, limiting infection IDP camps.24 hand-washing stations will be built in the IDP camps in Bondhere, Baidoa, Balcad, Gardho and Burtinle. Hygiene kits, containing bath soap, laundry soap, 2 jerry cans, and facemask, will be supplied to 3500 households. Special consideration will be given to female headed household and PWD. \n4. Livelihood: Improving livelihoods through unconditional cash transfer of USD 70 for 3 months to 333 households, and USD 70 cash assistance for 2 months to 333 households as livelihoods support. The beneficiaries will be selected using robust selection criteria that targets the most vulnerable and prioritise female headed household. The UCT will be done using mobile money transfer which has the benefit of increased security, convenience, privacy, speed, reduced operational/transaction costs and logistics for the beneficiaries and for Islamic relief. Somalia has large mobile network reach. The choice of money gives the beneficiaries the widest range of transactional capabilities and broad access to basic financial services (such as deposit, withdrawal, person-to-person transfers and e-money transactions with registered traders of goods and service providers). Islamic Relief used mobile money in drought/ flood emergency programme (including WFP Baxnaano programme). The lessons from previous experience which guide the choice of UCT include: \n-  Beneficiaries purchase a more diverse set of goods, had higher dietary diversity,\n- Beneficiaries depleted fewer assets and grew more types of crops, especially marginal cash crops grown by women.  They are able to o restock livelihood assets faster. The reasons for this can be attributed to the lower costs and greater privacy of receiving a cash transfer via the mobile transfer, as well as changes in intra-household decision-making.\n5. Establish complaint management and feedback mechanism to the affected population. Through this intervention, IR MEAL unit will ensure that project delivers responses as designed to the affected population. Through an established mechanism of complaints mechanism and feedback channels, the affected population will be made to understand and demand their rights until all is provided to their satisfaction. \n6. Build and establish DRR community champions for covid-19 preparedness, response and treatment. The established committee is trained on covid-19 risk reduction management. Their role is to ensure that community members are made aware of the impact of covid-19, where to seek treatment and how to enforce containment measures such as social distancing and use of mask and sanitisers as part of exposure reduction. \nIRS will lead the implementation. The project will build on existing IRS interventions in health WASH and livelihood sectors and maximise the impact and sustainability",

The research agenda aims to contribute with scientific knowledge being an foundation for the future design and testing of innovative models of care for the development of midwifery-led care in the Somali context. The expected output is a research agenda in line with the research ideas\u00a0to describe the magnitude of life-threatening, abortion-related complications and women\u2019s access to quality PAC and contraceptives in post-conflict Somaliland.A core group of researchers will be jointly responsible for activities in the collaboration plan. The project, starting in January 2021, will run for two years, during which the following activities are planned: build dialogues with the Somali Health Authorities and key UN health agencies, and engage them through workshops on evidence-based findings related to midwifery care; conduct research-agenda workshops and set research agenda/priorities; write joint publications and proposals; and disseminate the research agenda and proposals. The long-term goal of this project is to contribute scientific evidence to scale up the quality of midwifery care to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity in relation to giving birth in Somaliland.",

Detta avbr\u00f6ts av inb\u00f6rdeskriget i b\u00f6rjan av 1990-talet. Ett initiativ togs 2014 f\u00f6r att bygga vidare p\u00e5 det tidigare samarbetet och d\u00e4rmed bidra till nationella \u00e5teruppbyggnad i Somalia. Ett konsortium bildades - det somalisk-svenska forskningssamarbetet f\u00f6r h\u00e4lsa (SSRCH) - och denna ans\u00f6kan ligger i linje med det handlingsprogram f\u00f6r kapacitetsuppbyggnad inom h\u00e4lsoforskning som konsortiet utvecklat.Det somaliska h\u00e4lsosystemet har allvarliga utmaningar.

M\u00e5let \u00e4r att tre nya forskargrupper formeras och utvecklar sina forskningsplaner under kursens g\u00e5ng, men p\u00e5 sikt kommer sannolikt fler forskargrupper att formeras.Inom projektet kommer b\u00e5de somaliska och svenska forskare att utveckla sin kompetens inom social n\u00e4tverksanalysteori, samt evidensbaserad folkh\u00e4lsovetenskap inklusive forskningsmetoder f\u00f6r att ta fram denna kunskap. Detta kommer att bidra till att st\u00e4rka b\u00e5de somalisk och svensk akademin samt det Somaliska h\u00e4lsosystemet.

About 26% of Somalia\u00b4s population live a nomadic life, and this significant group of about 4 million people is believed to have even less access to modern health care and health promotion than the rest of the population.This project aims to build up a network of knowledgeable researchers in Somalia, Kenya and Sweden to, together with representatives of the nomadic population and the Ministry of Health, build up a knowledge bank on nomadic health and health care access. The project will also develop a research application for deeper analysis of 1) central health problems to the nomad population, 2) obstacles to access health care, and 3) design and test interventions to create better access to both emergency care and elective care under the special living conditions of the nomadic population.The University of Gothenburg, KEMRI (Wellcome Trust funded health research program in Kenya) and Benadir University in Somalia are initiating this work but intend to join more partners over the next two years. During the project, three major workshops will be conducted in the relatively safe Hargeisa, Somaliland, and the database will be built by Benadir University.",

        "description": "Omprogrammerade medel f\u00f6r att bek\u00e4mpa covid-19\nDetta beslut \u00e4r ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till avtal med R\u00e4dda Barnens Riksf\u00f6rbund i Sverige (RBS) om bidrag till Programmet \"RBS humanit\u00e4ra arbete 2017-2019\". Programmet syftar till att m\u00f6ta barns humanit\u00e4ra behov och att skydda barn mot v\u00e5ld och f\u00f6rsummelse i humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer. Speciellt fokus i Programmet \u00e4r \"barn i v\u00e4pnade konflikter\". \n\nRBS \u00e4r en del av R\u00e4dda Barnen globalt (Save the Children International, SCI) som tillsammans har expertis f\u00f6r att svara p\u00e5 uppkomna krissituationer r\u00f6rande skydd av barn i n\u00e4ra samarbete med lokala partners. RBS \u00e4r en av f\u00e5 samarbetsparter till Sida som har ett fokus p\u00e5 skydd av barn och f\u00f6rankring av barns r\u00e4ttigheter i humanit\u00e4ra kriser. \n\nRBS \u00e4r en av Sidas tio-talet partnerorganisationer f\u00f6r humanit\u00e4rt bist\u00e5nd sedan 2013, d\u00e5 ett stort antal organisationer utv\u00e4rderades i syfte att ing\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre ramavtal med Sida f\u00f6r humanit\u00e4rt st\u00f6d. Sida utf\u00f6r \u00e5rligen en humanit\u00e4r allokeringsprocess som sedan ligger till grund f\u00f6r vilka organisationer, landprojekt och tematiska-/kapacitetsst\u00e4rkande projekt som ska beviljas finansiellt st\u00f6d. I enlighet med denna process, bed\u00f6mer Sida det relevant att under 2018 st\u00f6dja RBS humanit\u00e4ra Program i 6 l\u00e4nder, och att bidra med RRM-medel (Rapid Response Mechanism), samt st\u00f6dja ett antal tematiska-/kapacitetsst\u00e4rkande omr\u00e5den.\n\nSida har i huvudsak goda erfarenheter fr\u00e5n tidigare samarbete med RBS och dess humanit\u00e4ra insatser. Sida baserar detta p\u00e5 resultaten fr\u00e5n en extern utv\u00e4rdering (SIPU 2016), RBS resultatrapportering, samt Sidas f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljningar (som genomf\u00f6rts i 27 l\u00e4nder) under 2017. RBS har ocks\u00e5 minskat sin responstid f\u00f6r att svara p\u00e5 akuta krissituationer med drygt 50% (fr\u00e5n flera veckor till maximalt 4-7 dagar) under 2017. Detta har gjort att RBS kommer in snabbare \u00e4n ett flertal andra humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rer i kriser. Genom att slussa Sidas RRM-medel, efter godk\u00e4nnande av Sida, genom SCIs globala katastroffond, har detta blivit m\u00f6jligt, f\u00f6rst p\u00e5 pilotbasis under 2017, och fr\u00e5n 2018 p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt.\n\nUnder 2013 slutf\u00f6rdes en omstrukturering av R\u00e4dda Barnens organisation internationellt. Omorganisationens genomf\u00f6rande globalt har tagit tid och i vissa kontexter p\u00e5g\u00e5r den fortfarande. Den har f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat R\u00e4dda Barnens globala organisationsstruktur och styrning med syfte att harmonisera organisationens processer och system f\u00f6r att standardisera och kvalitetss\u00e4kra planering, programuppf\u00f6ljning, personals\u00e4kerhet, finansiell kontroll med mera. Viss finjustering med att synkronisera systemen inom organisationen globalt forts\u00e4tter, bl.a. inom RBS, under 2017-2019.\n\nSidas relevansbed\u00f6mning av de landspecifika projekten f\u00f6r 2018 och de tv\u00e5 fler\u00e5riga st\u00f6den f\u00f6r 2018 och 2019 baseras, som tidigare sagts, p\u00e5 en global behovsbed\u00f6mning som g\u00f6rs \u00e5rligen av Sida/HUM. Samtliga projekt har ocks\u00e5 granskats av relevanta geografiska handl\u00e4ggare p\u00e5 Sida/HUM samt av relevanta ambassader. Sida bed\u00f6mer att RBS i huvudsak uppn\u00e5r Sidas krav avseende f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntade resultat, men att RBS bl.a. beh\u00f6ver forts\u00e4tta f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra sin rapportering (inklusive resultatramverk med m\u00e4tbara m\u00e5l och tydlig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringsteori) till Sida f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en b\u00e4ttre resultatanalys. Under 2018 f\u00f6resl\u00e5r RBS ocks\u00e5 att forts\u00e4tta fokusera p\u00e5 vidareutveckling av kvalitetss\u00e4kring och uppf\u00f6ljning av landkontorens genomf\u00f6rande av insatserna. RBS kommer ocks\u00e5 att f\u00f6lja innovationsfonden, HIFs (Humanitarian Innovation Fund), arbete n\u00e4rmare under \u00e5ret. HIF kommer att p\u00e5b\u00f6rja aktiviteter igen med Sida-finansiering under 2018. Under 2017 utbetalades inga Sida-medel till HIF d\u00e5 resultaten fr\u00e5n en utv\u00e4rdering och revision av tidigare samarbete inv\u00e4ntades. Genomf\u00f6randet av rekommendationerna fr\u00e5n dessa kommer att f\u00f6ljas noggrannt av RBS under \u00e5ret. \n\nBeslutet tas i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel paragraf 3.11.3. och avser andra \u00e5ret av ett tre\u00e5rigt avtal och omfattar totalt 80 300 000 kronor, varav 58 300 000 kronor \u00e4r f\u00f6r nya insatser \u00e5r 2018, och 22 000 000 kronor \u00e4r f\u00f6r redan beslutade insatser \u00e5r 2018. Tidigare beslutade medel f\u00f6r 2018 var 25 000 000 SEK. Av dessa medel kommer 3 MSEK inte att anv\u00e4ndas under 2018 (metodst\u00f6d HIF) och har d\u00e4rf\u00f6r \u00e5terf\u00f6rts av Sida/HUM. \n\nProgramf\u00f6rslaget f\u00f6r 2018 inneh\u00e5ller:\n- Sudan (4 000 000 kronor) som r\u00f6r skydd till flickor och pojkar som p\u00e5verkas av konflikten i norra och centrala Darfur.\n- Irak (4 000 000 kronor) som r\u00f6r skydd till flickor och pojkar i Ninewa som uts\u00e4tts f\u00f6r v\u00e5ld och utnyttjande och p\u00e5verkas av konflikten i landet. \n- Syrien (7 000 000 kronor), vilket r\u00f6r st\u00f6d till de mest utsatta barnen f\u00f6r skyddsinsatser i den p\u00e5g\u00e5ende konflikten i landet.\n- Jemen (15 000 000 kronor), vilken r\u00f6r skydd fr\u00e5n v\u00e5ld f\u00f6r de mest utsatta barnen i krigsomr\u00e5den.\n- RRM (26 000 000 kronor), oallokerade medel f\u00f6r nya/f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade kriser under \u00e5ret.\n- Metodst\u00f6d (2 300 000 kronor), vilket r\u00f6r st\u00f6d till RBS arbete/sekondering till UNICEF f\u00f6r delat ordf\u00f6randeskap i Alliance for Child Protection.\n\nRedan beslutade fler\u00e5riga projektf\u00f6rslag f\u00f6r 2018 inneh\u00e5ller:\n- Demokratiska republiken Kongo (7 000 000 kronor) som r\u00f6r skydd av barn fr\u00e5n v\u00e5ld i Sydkivu, vilket \u00e4r andra \u00e5ret av en tre\u00e5rig insats.\n- Libanon (5 000 000 kronor), vilken r\u00f6r f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrade nationella system f\u00f6r barnskydd f\u00f6r att bl.a. f\u00f6rhindra barnrekrytering till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende konflikt i Syrien.

SCIs huvudkontor finns i London, Storbritannien, och inom dess organisation finns 7 regionala kontor och 54 landkontor som t\u00e4cker 61 landprogram. RBS bidrar ocks\u00e5 med ett flertal personer till SCIs centrala register av katastrof/surge-personer som snabbt kan kallas in i krissituationer. I huvudsak vidaref\u00f6rmedlas alla Sidas medel fr\u00e5n RBS via SCI till R\u00e4dda Barnens olika genomf\u00f6rande landkontor. F\u00f6r 2018 kommer ungef\u00e4r 85% att vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till landkontoren och resterande 15% av Sidas medel kommer att finnas kvar hos RBS f\u00f6r tematiskt- och kapacitetsst\u00f6d (bl.a. f\u00f6r f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad kvalitetss\u00e4kring) samt metodst\u00f6d f\u00f6r globala barnalliansen (8%). Resterande 7% tillkommer RBS f\u00f6r att t\u00e4cka administrationskostnader (detta tillfaller RBS som helhet, inte enbart dess humanit\u00e4ra enhet). \n\n\u00d6VRIGT\nSida bed\u00f6mer att samtliga medel f\u00f6r Programmet ska betalas ut omg\u00e5ende f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra planering och uppstart av projekten till b\u00f6rjan av 2018.

Ett avsteg fr\u00e5n Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bed\u00f6ms motiverat.\n\nRBS ges i avtalet fortsatt flexibilitet att omallokera medel inom en projektbudget inom ett land p\u00e5 upp till 10%. Detta bed\u00f6ms vara n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt f\u00f6r att p\u00e5 ett relevant, snabbt och \u00e4ndam\u00e5lsenligt s\u00e4tt kunna m\u00f6ta humanit\u00e4ra behov. \u00d6vrig omallokering kr\u00e4ver Sidas godk\u00e4nnande.\n\nDet b\u00f6r ocks\u00e5 p\u00e5pekas att ett avsteg har gjorts fr\u00e5n de Allm\u00e4nna villkoren (artikel 5.3) i avtalet mellan Sida och RBS vad g\u00e4ller \u00e4gander\u00e4tten till utrustning, fordon och varor som belastat RBS budget: Mot bakgrund av att insatsen \u00e4r humanit\u00e4r beh\u00f6ver de senare inte \u00f6verf\u00f6ras till lokal samarbetspart och/eller slutmottagare i slutet av programmets avtalsperiod.\n\nBed\u00f6mningspromemorian har skrivits p\u00e5 engelska med anledning av att engelskspr\u00e5kig personal i f\u00e4lt \u00e4r delaktig i beredningen och uppf\u00f6ljningen av insatsen, i enlighet med Generaldirekt\u00f6rens beslut om Sidas spr\u00e5kvalsmatris med till\u00e4mpningsanvisningar fr\u00e5n den 1 mars 2013.",

Det ber\u00e4knas att 815 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor \u00e4r kroniskt matos\u00e4kra. I v\u00e4rsta fall kan kronisk matos\u00e4kerhet leda till humanit\u00e4ra kriser i form av extrem hunger och sv\u00e4lt, vilket p\u00e5visades i flertalet kontexter 2017 och 2018 s\u00e5 som Somalia, Nigeria, Sydsudan och Jemen.\n\nFAO har \u00f6ver 194 medlemsstater och verksamhet i \u00f6ver 130 av dessa.

Over 1 miljon m\u00e4nniskor fick kontanterst\u00f6d vilket gav m\u00e4nniskorna medel som de kunde anv\u00e4nda omedelbart f\u00f6r att \u00e5teruppta den egna sj\u00e4lvf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningen.

        "description": "Den nuvarande utvecklingen i Somalia och det f\u00f6rnyade \u00e5tagandet fr\u00e5n det internationella samfundet att st\u00f6tta Somalia p\u00e5 v\u00e4gen till l\u00e5ngsiktig fred och statsbyggande har \u00f6ppnat upp nya m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r Sverige att engagera sig f\u00f6r f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring i landet. Som framh\u00e4vts i Somali Compact och The Economic Recovery Plan, ligger jobbskapande, ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt och n\u00e4ringslivsutveckling i centrum f\u00f6r Somalias \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning. \n\nI linje med detta \u00e4r programmets \u00f6vergripande syfte att bidra till den l\u00e5ngsiktiga rekonstruktionen av det konfliktdrabbade somaliska samh\u00e4llet genom att \u00f6ka m\u00e4nsklig s\u00e4kerhet och m\u00f6jlighet till f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning. Programmets specifika syfte \u00e4r att \u00e5stadkomma detta genom jobbskapande och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad inkomst speciellt f\u00f6r kvinnor och ungdomar i hela landet.\n \nForum Syd, som blir avtalspart till ambassaden, har tillsammans med Business Sweden utarbetat detta program. Ambassaden anser att de tv\u00e5 organisationernas kompetenser och erfarenheter kompletterar varandra v\u00e4l. Medan Forum Syd har l\u00e5ng erfarenhet av den Somaliska kontexten och har samarbetat med den somaliska diasporan samt lokala intressenter i olika program f\u00f6rut s\u00e5 har Business Sweden specialistkunskap r\u00f6rande fr\u00e5gor inom aff\u00e4rsutveckling, marknadsanalys, handel och dess regelverk mm.\n\nProgrammet avser att agera katalytiskt och engagera diasporan genom att skapa en ekonomisk h\u00e4vst\u00e5ngseffekt samt underl\u00e4tta kunskaps\u00f6verf\u00f6ring. Genom att ta vara p\u00e5 entrepren\u00f6rsandan samt kulturella kopplingar till Somalia kan den somaliska diasporan i Sverige och p\u00e5 andra st\u00e4llen spela en viktig roll i att skapa jobb f\u00f6r befolkningen i Somalia. Dock \u00e4r det viktigt att klarg\u00f6ra att programmet inte bara riktar sig till diasporan utan alla som vill investera i landet.  \n\nProgrammet har ett brett tillv\u00e4gag\u00e5ngs\u00e4tt som utg\u00f6rs av fyra st\u00f6rre best\u00e5ndsdelar som avser att komplettera varandra: \n1. A Capacity Development Facility (CDF) f\u00f6r intresserade entrepren\u00f6rer och potentiella f\u00f6rm\u00e5nstagare. CDF kommer att delas in i generell kapacitetsutveckling i f\u00f6retagsutveckling i Somalia liksom en skr\u00e4ddarsydd kapacitetsutveckling f\u00f6r f\u00f6rm\u00e5nstagare. \n2. A Challenge Fund som erbjuder finansiering till entrepren\u00f6rer vid ett tidigt stadium av en aff\u00e4rssatsning f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra utforskandet av nya m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r jobbskapande aff\u00e4rsverksamheter.    \n3. St\u00f6d till entrepren\u00f6rer f\u00f6r att s\u00f6ka ytterligare finansiering fr\u00e5n andra st\u00f6rre finansieringsk\u00e4llor. \n4.

        "description": "Den nuvarande utvecklingen i Somalia och det f\u00f6rnyade \u00e5tagandet fr\u00e5n det internationella samfundet att st\u00f6tta Somalia p\u00e5 v\u00e4gen till l\u00e5ngsiktig fred och statsbyggande har \u00f6ppnat upp nya m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r Sverige att engagera sig f\u00f6r f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring i landet. Som framh\u00e4vts i Somali Compact och The Economic Recovery Plan, ligger jobbskapande, ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt och n\u00e4ringslivsutveckling i centrum f\u00f6r Somalias \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning. \n\nI linje med detta \u00e4r programmets \u00f6vergripande syfte att bidra till den l\u00e5ngsiktiga rekonstruktionen av det konfliktdrabbade somaliska samh\u00e4llet genom att \u00f6ka m\u00e4nsklig s\u00e4kerhet och m\u00f6jlighet till f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning. Programmets specifika syfte \u00e4r att \u00e5stadkomma detta genom jobbskapande och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad inkomst speciellt f\u00f6r kvinnor och ungdomar i hela landet.\n \nForum Syd, som blir avtalspart till ambassaden, har tillsammans med Business Sweden utarbetat detta program. Ambassaden anser att de tv\u00e5 organisationernas kompetenser och erfarenheter kompletterar varandra v\u00e4l. Medan Forum Syd har l\u00e5ng erfarenhet av den Somaliska kontexten och har samarbetat med den somaliska diasporan samt lokala intressenter i olika program f\u00f6rut s\u00e5 har Business Sweden specialistkunskap r\u00f6rande fr\u00e5gor inom aff\u00e4rsutveckling, marknadsanalys, handel och dess regelverk mm.\n\nProgrammet avser att agera katalytiskt och engagera diasporan genom att skapa en ekonomisk h\u00e4vst\u00e5ngseffekt samt underl\u00e4tta kunskaps\u00f6verf\u00f6ring. Genom att ta vara p\u00e5 entrepren\u00f6rsandan samt kulturella kopplingar till Somalia kan den somaliska diasporan i Sverige och p\u00e5 andra st\u00e4llen spela en viktig roll i att skapa jobb f\u00f6r befolkningen i Somalia. Dock \u00e4r det viktigt att klarg\u00f6ra att programmet inte bara riktar sig till diasporan utan alla som vill investera i landet.  \n\nProgrammet har ett brett tillv\u00e4gag\u00e5ngs\u00e4tt som utg\u00f6rs av fyra st\u00f6rre best\u00e5ndsdelar som avser att komplettera varandra: \n1. A Capacity Development Facility (CDF) f\u00f6r intresserade entrepren\u00f6rer och potentiella f\u00f6rm\u00e5nstagare. CDF kommer att delas in i generell kapacitetsutveckling i f\u00f6retagsutveckling i Somalia liksom en skr\u00e4ddarsydd kapacitetsutveckling f\u00f6r f\u00f6rm\u00e5nstagare. \n2. A Challenge Fund som erbjuder finansiering till entrepren\u00f6rer vid ett tidigt stadium av en aff\u00e4rssatsning f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra utforskandet av nya m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r jobbskapande aff\u00e4rsverksamheter.    \n3. St\u00f6d till entrepren\u00f6rer f\u00f6r att s\u00f6ka ytterligare finansiering fr\u00e5n andra st\u00f6rre finansieringsk\u00e4llor. \n4.

        "description": "Global utblick\nUnder de senaste tio \u00e5ren har antalet m\u00e4nniskor i humanit\u00e4ra kriser mer \u00e4n fyrdubblats. \u00c5r 2018 ber\u00e4knas 135,7 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor vara i behov av humanit\u00e4rt st\u00f6d, varav de flesta befinner sig i konfliktdrabbade omr\u00e5den. Gemensamt beh\u00f6ver de humanit\u00e4ra appellerna 22,5 miljarder kronor. De snabbt \u00f6kade humanit\u00e4ra behoven st\u00e4ller h\u00f6ga krav p\u00e5 dagens humanit\u00e4ra system, b\u00e5de operationellt och finansiellt. Stark samordning, n\u00e4rhet till responsen samt st\u00f6d till lokala akt\u00f6rer med tilltr\u00e4desm\u00f6jligheter \u00e4r grundf\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar f\u00f6r ett effektivt humanit\u00e4rt bist\u00e5nd. D\u00e4rmed \u00e4r de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna, s\u00e5 kallade Country Based Pooled Funds (CBPF), av central betydelse f\u00f6r den humanit\u00e4ra responseffektiviteten.\n\nVad \u00e4r en CBPF/humanit\u00e4r landfond?\nEn CBPF \u00e4r en fond som uppr\u00e4ttas p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5, i vilken flertalet givare tills\u00e4tter resurser i en och samma fond. Beslut om f\u00f6rdelning av fondens medel sker p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5. P\u00e5 grund av CBPFens n\u00e4rhet till responsen och h\u00f6g grad av lokal f\u00f6rankring har den en stark tradition av att st\u00f6dja lokala akt\u00f6rer med goda tilltr\u00e4desm\u00f6jligheter samt lokal kunskap. N\u00e5got som visat sig \u00e4n viktigare de senaste \u00e5ren, pga av det \u00f6kade antalet konflikter i v\u00e4rlden. Under 2017 utgick 23% av det totala st\u00f6det direkt till lokala partners.  \n\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) har huvudansvaret f\u00f6r dessa fonder. OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) \u00e4r formellt ansvarig f\u00f6r etablerandet och avvecklandet av dessa fonder, samt f\u00f6r deras operationella effektivitet. P\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 \u00e4r den av ERC utsedda humanit\u00e4re koordinatorn (HC) ansvarig f\u00f6r respektive fond. Den humanit\u00e4re koordinatorns ansvar \u00e4r av central betydelse d\u00e5 det st\u00e4rker den humanit\u00e4ra samordningen i f\u00e4lt, vilket \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt pga av det st\u00e4ndigt \u00f6kade antalet humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rer. Detta regleras i de Globala riktlinjerna vilka \u00e4r obligatoriska f\u00f6r samtliga humanit\u00e4ra landfonder. De Globla riktlinjerna som \u00e4r obligatoriska att f\u00f6lja f\u00f6r samtliga fonder lanserades av OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef (ERC) i februari 2015. Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och st\u00e4rkts p\u00e5 ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen st\u00e4rker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppf\u00f6ljning p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5).  \n\nGivare har en r\u00e5dgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen \u201dAdvisory Board (AB)\u201d samt det globala r\u00e5dgivande forumet \u201dPooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, som b\u00e5da sk\u00f6ts av OCHA. Sida har en stark tradition att vara aktiv i b\u00e4gge sammanhangen genom ambassaderna och den humanit\u00e4ra enhetens fortl\u00f6pande arbete p\u00e5 nationell och global niv\u00e5. Sida har dessutom sedan 2013 etablerat rutiner f\u00f6r regulj\u00e4r uppf\u00f6ljning av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna samt st\u00e4rkt l\u00e4nken mellan projektuppf\u00f6ljningen i f\u00e4lt och konkreta dialogfr\u00e5gor som f\u00f6rs p\u00e5 global niv\u00e5. Under 2017 f\u00f6ljde Sida upp 16 av 18 landfonder (ej Centralafrikanska republiken och Jemen). \n\nSveriges roll i CBPFs/humanit\u00e4ra landfonder (tidigare kallade CHFer och ERFer)\nSverige har sedan uppr\u00e4ttandet av den f\u00f6rsta CBPFen (1997 i Angola) varit en p\u00e5drivande kraft i st\u00e4rkandet av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna. Det svenska finansiella och politiska st\u00f6det till fonderna har ytterligare st\u00e4rkts med \u00e5ren, d\u00e5 fr\u00e5gan om lokal f\u00f6rankring samt humanit\u00e4r samordning blivit centrala i \u201dStrategin f\u00f6r Sveriges humanit\u00e4ra bist\u00e5nd genom Styrelsen f\u00f6r internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (Sida) 2017-2020\u201d. \u00c5r 2015 f\u00f6rst\u00e4rktes denna position ytterligare genom en internationell h\u00f6gniv\u00e5 panel om humanit\u00e4r finansiering som tillsats av FNs Generalsekreterare och i vilken utrikesminister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m deltog. En av panelens huvudrekommendationer var att \u00f6ka st\u00f6det till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna i syfte att effektivisera det humanit\u00e4ra systemet.\n\nVal av CBPFer f\u00f6r Sida st\u00f6d har skett p\u00e5 basis av Sidas behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess. I vilken humanit\u00e4ra kriser i v\u00e4rlden analyseras utifr\u00e5n de humanit\u00e4ra principerna, i synnerhet opartiskhets principen. Sedan f\u00f6resl\u00e5s de mest relevanta partners f\u00f6r st\u00f6d i respektive kris. Den planerade insatsen att st\u00f6dja FNs humanit\u00e4ra landfonder \u00e4r avst\u00e4mt med UD inom ramen f\u00f6r HUMSAM och \u00e4r i linje med 2018 \u00e5rs humanit\u00e4ra allokering. Sverige \u00e4r idag globalt den tredje st\u00f6rsta givaren till CBPFerna. \n\nSida kommer att inom ramen f\u00f6r denna beredning ing\u00e5 avtal med tv\u00e5 parter, d\u00e5 fonderna formellt administreras av OCHA respektive Multi Partner Trust Fund Office/United Nations Development Programme (MPTFO/UNDP). \n\nAvtalet 2018 med OCHA g\u00e4ller elva humanit\u00e4ra landfonder som inbegrips i ett och samma avtal och som f\u00f6ljer samma format som tidigare \u00e5rs avtal med OCHA. \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Etiopien (35 MSEK), Irak (15 MSEK), Jemen (50 MSEK), Myanmar (10 MSEK), Pakistan (23 MSEK), Syrien (20 MSEK), Jordanien/Syrenkrisen (20 MSEK), Libanon/Syrienkrisen (15 MSEK),Turkiet/Syrienkrisen (25 MSEK) Palestina (15 MSEK) och Nigeria (20 MSEK). \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen f\u00f6r avtalet 2018 med MPTFO/UNDP \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Afghanistan (60 MSEK), Central Afrikanska Republiken (12 MSEK), Demokratiska Republiken Kongo (80 MSEK), Syd Sudan (48 MSEK), Sudan (57 MSEK), samt Somalia (35 MSEK). \n\nSida f\u00f6resl\u00e5s besluta om ytterligare finansiering 2018 med 540 000 000 SEK (varav 24 MSEK beslutats om tidigare) i ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till nuvarande avtal med OCHA samt ett till\u00e4ggsavtal med MPTFO/UNDP till sammanlagt sjutton landfonder. Sida bed\u00f6mer att samtliga medel skall utbetalas i b\u00f6rjan p\u00e5 \u00e5ret f\u00f6r att p\u00e5 b\u00e4sta s\u00e4tt m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra planering och genomf\u00f6rande av humanit\u00e4ra insatser utan f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. \n\nGenom en enhetlig beredning som inbegriper alla sjutton fonder st\u00e4rks den humanit\u00e4ra enhets kapacitet att arbeta mer systematiskt med de sjutton fonderna. Fr\u00e4mst genom j\u00e4mf\u00f6rande landanalyser samt en sammanh\u00e5llen uppf\u00f6ljningsstruktur, i vilken ambassader och den humanit\u00e4ra enheten ing\u00e5r. En annan f\u00f6rdel med sammanslagningen av beredningen \u00e4r att ambassaderna kan frig\u00f6ra ytterligare resurser till fortl\u00f6pande uppf\u00f6ljning av fondernas effektivitet i f\u00e4lt, samt att Sida kan fokusera ytterligare p\u00e5 strategiska fr\u00e5gor inom ramen f\u00f6r de nationella r\u00e5dgivande styrgrupperna, \u201dAdvisory Boards\u201d.

        "description": "Global utblick\nUnder de senaste tio \u00e5ren har antalet m\u00e4nniskor i humanit\u00e4ra kriser mer \u00e4n fyrdubblats. \u00c5r 2018 ber\u00e4knas 135,7 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor vara i behov av humanit\u00e4rt st\u00f6d, varav de flesta befinner sig i konfliktdrabbade omr\u00e5den. Gemensamt beh\u00f6ver de humanit\u00e4ra appellerna 22,5 miljarder kronor. De snabbt \u00f6kade humanit\u00e4ra behoven st\u00e4ller h\u00f6ga krav p\u00e5 dagens humanit\u00e4ra system, b\u00e5de operationellt och finansiellt. Stark samordning, n\u00e4rhet till responsen samt st\u00f6d till lokala akt\u00f6rer med tilltr\u00e4desm\u00f6jligheter \u00e4r grundf\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar f\u00f6r ett effektivt humanit\u00e4rt bist\u00e5nd. D\u00e4rmed \u00e4r de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna, s\u00e5 kallade Country Based Pooled Funds (CBPF), av central betydelse f\u00f6r den humanit\u00e4ra responseffektiviteten.\n\nVad \u00e4r en CBPF/humanit\u00e4r landfond?\nEn CBPF \u00e4r en fond som uppr\u00e4ttas p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5, i vilken flertalet givare tills\u00e4tter resurser i en och samma fond. Beslut om f\u00f6rdelning av fondens medel sker p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5. P\u00e5 grund av CBPFens n\u00e4rhet till responsen och h\u00f6g grad av lokal f\u00f6rankring har den en stark tradition av att st\u00f6dja lokala akt\u00f6rer med goda tilltr\u00e4desm\u00f6jligheter samt lokal kunskap. N\u00e5got som visat sig \u00e4n viktigare de senaste \u00e5ren, pga av det \u00f6kade antalet konflikter i v\u00e4rlden. Under 2017 utgick 23% av det totala st\u00f6det direkt till lokala partners.  \n\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) har huvudansvaret f\u00f6r dessa fonder. OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) \u00e4r formellt ansvarig f\u00f6r etablerandet och avvecklandet av dessa fonder, samt f\u00f6r deras operationella effektivitet. P\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 \u00e4r den av ERC utsedda humanit\u00e4re koordinatorn (HC) ansvarig f\u00f6r respektive fond. Den humanit\u00e4re koordinatorns ansvar \u00e4r av central betydelse d\u00e5 det st\u00e4rker den humanit\u00e4ra samordningen i f\u00e4lt, vilket \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt pga av det st\u00e4ndigt \u00f6kade antalet humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rer. Detta regleras i de Globala riktlinjerna vilka \u00e4r obligatoriska f\u00f6r samtliga humanit\u00e4ra landfonder. De Globla riktlinjerna som \u00e4r obligatoriska att f\u00f6lja f\u00f6r samtliga fonder lanserades av OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef (ERC) i februari 2015. Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och st\u00e4rkts p\u00e5 ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen st\u00e4rker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppf\u00f6ljning p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5).  \n\nGivare har en r\u00e5dgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen \u201dAdvisory Board (AB)\u201d samt det globala r\u00e5dgivande forumet \u201dPooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, som b\u00e5da sk\u00f6ts av OCHA. Sida har en stark tradition att vara aktiv i b\u00e4gge sammanhangen genom ambassaderna och den humanit\u00e4ra enhetens fortl\u00f6pande arbete p\u00e5 nationell och global niv\u00e5. Sida har dessutom sedan 2013 etablerat rutiner f\u00f6r regulj\u00e4r uppf\u00f6ljning av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna samt st\u00e4rkt l\u00e4nken mellan projektuppf\u00f6ljningen i f\u00e4lt och konkreta dialogfr\u00e5gor som f\u00f6rs p\u00e5 global niv\u00e5. Under 2017 f\u00f6ljde Sida upp 16 av 18 landfonder (ej Centralafrikanska republiken och Jemen). \n\nSveriges roll i CBPFs/humanit\u00e4ra landfonder (tidigare kallade CHFer och ERFer)\nSverige har sedan uppr\u00e4ttandet av den f\u00f6rsta CBPFen (1997 i Angola) varit en p\u00e5drivande kraft i st\u00e4rkandet av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna. Det svenska finansiella och politiska st\u00f6det till fonderna har ytterligare st\u00e4rkts med \u00e5ren, d\u00e5 fr\u00e5gan om lokal f\u00f6rankring samt humanit\u00e4r samordning blivit centrala i \u201dStrategin f\u00f6r Sveriges humanit\u00e4ra bist\u00e5nd genom Styrelsen f\u00f6r internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (Sida) 2017-2020\u201d. \u00c5r 2015 f\u00f6rst\u00e4rktes denna position ytterligare genom en internationell h\u00f6gniv\u00e5 panel om humanit\u00e4r finansiering som tillsats av FNs Generalsekreterare och i vilken utrikesminister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m deltog. En av panelens huvudrekommendationer var att \u00f6ka st\u00f6det till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna i syfte att effektivisera det humanit\u00e4ra systemet.\n\nVal av CBPFer f\u00f6r Sida st\u00f6d har skett p\u00e5 basis av Sidas behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess. I vilken humanit\u00e4ra kriser i v\u00e4rlden analyseras utifr\u00e5n de humanit\u00e4ra principerna, i synnerhet opartiskhets principen. Sedan f\u00f6resl\u00e5s de mest relevanta partners f\u00f6r st\u00f6d i respektive kris. Den planerade insatsen att st\u00f6dja FNs humanit\u00e4ra landfonder \u00e4r avst\u00e4mt med UD inom ramen f\u00f6r HUMSAM och \u00e4r i linje med 2018 \u00e5rs humanit\u00e4ra allokering. Sverige \u00e4r idag globalt den tredje st\u00f6rsta givaren till CBPFerna. \n\nSida kommer att inom ramen f\u00f6r denna beredning ing\u00e5 avtal med tv\u00e5 parter, d\u00e5 fonderna formellt administreras av OCHA respektive Multi Partner Trust Fund Office/United Nations Development Programme (MPTFO/UNDP). \n\nAvtalet 2018 med OCHA g\u00e4ller elva humanit\u00e4ra landfonder som inbegrips i ett och samma avtal och som f\u00f6ljer samma format som tidigare \u00e5rs avtal med OCHA. \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Etiopien (35 MSEK), Irak (15 MSEK), Jemen (50 MSEK), Myanmar (10 MSEK), Pakistan (23 MSEK), Syrien (20 MSEK), Jordanien/Syrenkrisen (20 MSEK), Libanon/Syrienkrisen (15 MSEK),Turkiet/Syrienkrisen (25 MSEK) Palestina (15 MSEK) och Nigeria (20 MSEK). \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen f\u00f6r avtalet 2018 med MPTFO/UNDP \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Afghanistan (60 MSEK), Central Afrikanska Republiken (12 MSEK), Demokratiska Republiken Kongo (80 MSEK), Syd Sudan (48 MSEK), Sudan (57 MSEK), samt Somalia (35 MSEK). \n\nSida f\u00f6resl\u00e5s besluta om ytterligare finansiering 2018 med 540 000 000 SEK (varav 24 MSEK beslutats om tidigare) i ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till nuvarande avtal med OCHA samt ett till\u00e4ggsavtal med MPTFO/UNDP till sammanlagt sjutton landfonder.

F\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 detta kommer Sida att tillhandah\u00e5lla en garanti till One Earth Foundation, OEF, som d\u00e5 ocks\u00e5 blir Sidas garantipartner. OEF \u00e4r en amerikansk NGO med projekt i Somalia. Arbetet i Somalia hanteras under ett projekt kallat Shuraako. Shuraako arbetar f\u00f6r att underl\u00e4tta investeringar i lovande f\u00f6retag baserade i Somalia. OEF kommer i sin tur att skriva separata avtal med tre (av i dagsl\u00e4get sex) somaliska finansiella institutioner: Dahabshil Bank, Premier Bank och International Bank of Somalia men ytterligare finansiella institutioner kan tillkomma under insatsperioden. \nDe tre bankerna \u00e4r de som de facto ger l\u00e5nen till m\u00e5lgruppen genom att f\u00e5 riskdelning med garantin. Garantin till OEF medger att bankerna f\u00e5r ett riskavlyft upp till 70% f\u00f6r det fall l\u00e5n inte \u00e5terbetalas medan banken tar resterande 30%. OEF r\u00e4knar med att ca 260 l\u00e5n kommer garanteras och att drygt 2000 jobb skapas under projekttidens fem \u00e5r. \n\nGarantiinsatsen p\u00e5 5 miljoner USD kompletteras med en g\u00e5vodel till OEF f\u00f6r tekniskt st\u00f6d (TA) till bankerna och MSME inklusive t\u00e4ckning av OEFs operativa kostnader f\u00f6r att hantera och f\u00f6lja upp garantiinstrumentet. G\u00e5vodelen \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt f\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 insatsens m\u00e5l. Garantiinstrumentet och g\u00e5vodelen kommer att hanteras i tv\u00e5 separata avtal d\u00e4r g\u00e5voavtalet hanteras av ambassaden.",

St\u00f6d till Ukraina (5 MSEK) och ut\u00f6kat st\u00f6d till Sydsydan (fr\u00e5n en budget p\u00e5 4,5 MSEK till 13,5 MSEK) kommer att betalas ut efter att SRK inkommit med, och Sida godk\u00e4nt, till\u00e4ggsans\u00f6kningar f\u00f6r dessa kontexter. \n\nSRK \u00e4r en del av internationella r\u00f6dakors- och r\u00f6dahalvm\u00e5ner\u00f6relsen som best\u00e5r av 190 nationella r\u00f6dakors- och r\u00f6dahalvm\u00e5nef\u00f6reningar, Internationella r\u00f6dakors- och r\u00f6dahalvm\u00e5nefederationen (IFRC) och Internationella r\u00f6dakorskommitt\u00e9n (ICRC). Sida ger st\u00f6d till internationella r\u00f6dakors- och r\u00f6dahalvm\u00e5ner\u00f6relsen via tv\u00e5 kanaler: ICRC och SRK. SRK vidaref\u00f6rmedlar st\u00f6rre delen av Sidas st\u00f6d till nationella f\u00f6reningar, IFRC och ICRC och arbetar i l\u00e5ngsiktigt partnerskap med fjorton l\u00e4nder: Kamerun, DR Kongo, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Irak, Palestina, Syrien, Jemen och Ukraina. \n\nSRKs strategiska samarbete med partners inom r\u00f6relsen - med andra nationella f\u00f6reningar, IFRC och ICRC - \u00e4r centralt och ger SRK m\u00f6jlighet att arbeta b\u00e5de p\u00e5 global och lokal niv\u00e5. SRK bed\u00f6ms d\u00e4rut\u00f6ver ha system, kompetens och kapacitet att st\u00e4rka den lokala kapaciteten hos nationella f\u00f6reningar att f\u00f6rutse och f\u00f6rebygga katastrofer och bidra till \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning samt att bidra med snabbt humanit\u00e4rt st\u00f6d vid pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna kriser. SRK har haft sv\u00e5rt att p\u00e5visa den humanit\u00e4ra relevansen i de Sida-finansierade projekten d\u00e5 de ofta r\u00f6r sig i gr\u00e4nslandet mellan det humanit\u00e4ra och l\u00e5ngsiktig utveckling. SRKs nya humanit\u00e4ra strategi 2016-2019 l\u00e4gger dock ett st\u00f6rre fokus p\u00e5 humanit\u00e4ra insatser och denna nya strategi speglas i SRKs ans\u00f6kan om medel fr\u00e5n Sida 2017-2019. Ett flertal projekt som riktar sig mot l\u00e5ngsiktig utveckling har tagits bort i ans\u00f6kan och nya projekt med ett tydligare humanit\u00e4rt fokus har inkluderats, s\u00e5som Jemen och Kamerun (projekt som riktar sig till CAR flyktingar). Det kommer att vara viktigt att f\u00f6lja upp denna inriktning mot en st\u00e4rkt humanit\u00e4ra relevans f\u00f6r Sida-finansierade projekt.\n\nPlanerat st\u00f6d f\u00f6r 2017 innefattar l\u00e5ngsiktiga projekt inom olika verksamheter s\u00e5som h\u00e4lsa, katastroff\u00f6rebyggande, resiliens, sanitet, organisationsutveckling, volont\u00e4rutveckling samt planering, uppf\u00f6ljning, utv\u00e4rdering och resultat (PMER). St\u00f6det innefattar \u00e4ven regionalt st\u00f6d till IFRC:s olika kluster- och regionkontor i Afrika, Asien och MENA. Det tematiska- och kapacitetsh\u00f6jande st\u00f6det kommer 2017 fokusera p\u00e5 katastrofreducering, volont\u00e4rverksamhet i konflikt och katastrof, vatten och sanitet, h\u00e4lsa, samt gender och m\u00e5ngfald. Genom st\u00f6d i form av Sidas snabbinsats-mekanism - Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) - kommer SRK \u00e4ven kunna svara p\u00e5 hastigt uppkomna eller eskalerande katastrofer. \n\nProgramf\u00f6rslaget f\u00f6r 2017 inneh\u00e5ller:\nV\u00c4ST- OCH CENTRALAFRIKA REGIONALT ST\u00d6D: 1,3 MSEK\nKAMERUN: 2 MSEK\nDR KONGO: 5 MSEK\n\u00d6ST- OCH S\u00d6DRA AFRIKA REGIONALT ST\u00d6D: 2,1 MSEK\n\u00d6STAFRIKA CLUSTER (Nairobi): 2,5 MSEK\nSOMALIA: 4 MSEK \nSYDSUDAN: 13,5 MSEK\nSUDAN: 4 MSEK\nASIEN PACIFIC REGIONALT ST\u00d6D: 5,8 MSEK\nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nBANGLADESH: 6 MSEK\nNORDKOREA: 4,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \nMENA REGIONALT ST\u00d6D: 4,3 MSEK\nIRAK: 7 MSEK\nPALESTINA: 3 MSEK\nSYRIEN inklusive Libanon och Jordanien: 30 MSEK \nYEMEN: 4,5 MSEK\nUKRAINA: 5 MSEK\nKAPACITET- OCH METODST\u00d6D: 7,9 MSEK \nRRM-ST\u00d6D: 40 MSEK\nST\u00d6D TILL IFRC DREF: 500 000 SEK \nS\u00c4RSKILDA INSATSER/ICRC DELEGATER: 3,6 MSEK\n\nProgramf\u00f6rslaget f\u00f6r 2018 inneh\u00e5ller:\nDR KONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nProgramf\u00f6rslaget f\u00f6r 2019 inneh\u00e5ller:\nDR KONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nUtav Sidas initiala st\u00f6d f\u00f6r 2017 p\u00e5 totalt 167,5 MSEK vidaref\u00f6rmedlas ca 61,2 % (102,5 MSEK) till IFRC och ca 2,6 % till ICRC (4,5 MSEK).

The program covers the period 2017-2019 and the total budget for the program is SEK 35 400 000. LPI applying for support from Sida / Embassy in Nairobi for the program of which Sweden is funding 44% of the total budget 80 356 743 SEK. LPI has applied for EU funding through their call for proposals that are taking place during March 2017. LPI is applying for funding together with the Somali partner Somali Peace Line (SPL). LPI is currently investigating other potential donors. LPI has adjusted the current planning for 2017 to fit with the proposed support from Sida (and EU funds for CRM Phase II). The program is currently underfunded by 26%.The proposal also includes an integrated component of emergency aid to the ongoing and severe drought that hit the country in 2016 and continues to pose a threat in 2017. According to LPI, this response, with activities such as the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, job creation efforts, health nutritional packages, cholera prevention, hygiene training, food ration and the distribution of food parcels, knowledge about basic health program and services, strengthening social cohesion etc., constitutes a prerequisite to conduct the comprehensive peace building work in the areas that are the hardest hit by the drought.

In Decision 2016-002435, dated 30 June 2015, Sida decided to support MPTF 2015-2017 with an amount of 140 MSEK. Following the decision 52/16 from November 2016, an additional 33 MSEK was added and an additional  55 MSEK through decision 14/17, dated April 24, 2017 and finally 10 MSEK was added in Dwecember 2017 through decision 58/2017. Sida assess that the MPTF and the joint programs that Sweden contributes to delivers results despite some challenges that comes with implementation of programmes in a difficult context.The MPTF was established in 2015 with Sweden as one of the first donors. The fund currently manages a total of USD 200 million. The two biggest donors are the EU followed by UK. So far, Sweden has contributed with 238 MSEK during the period and is thereby the third largest donor to the fund. During the period 2015-2017, Sweden has supported the central political processes (elections, constitution, parliament and the new federal state formation), the development of the judiciary, job creation for young people, and public administration. Furthermore, Sweden has provided support to the UN's core functions to enable effective implementation in a challenging context like Somalia. In addition, pilot support for the fund's so-called \"national window\", to use Somalia\u2019s own country systems have been successfully supported to a prison rehabilitation facility, supplementing the above-mentioned legal aid program. Despite challenges on an overall level, it is Sida's assessment that these programs together deliver results.Moreover, Sida assess that the MPTF is now fully established and that the programmes that are funded are implemented satisfactory. The international community has made significant commitments. Somalia has developed a National Development Plan (NDP) for Somalia 2017-2019. In addition, a Security Pact was adopted at the Somalia Conference held in May 2017 in London. The Security Pact sets out the roadmap for a Comprehensive Approach to Security, CAS. Hence, the UN has developed its own strategic plan (UNSF) for Somalia that reflects both the NDP and CAS. The MPTF is the main funding mechanism for UN support the implementation on the UNSF.Sida assess that the MPTF continues to be relevant and appropriate mechanism to deliver support. Based on Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Somalia and the new Strategy to come, Sida proposes that the continued support to the MPTF shall be earmarked for the following thematic areas and for the programs decided in the framework of these:1. Including policies, governance and federal state building, as well as reconciliation2. Human rights, women, peace and security3. Economic recovery and resilience4. Reproductive, maternity and child health and rightsHowever, the MPTF is not only a financing mechanism but also constitutes a platform for donor coordination in a broader sense since it includes the major actors such as the EU, UK, US, NO, DE, and DK. At the same time, there is a trend that the EU and the UK are launching new bilateral programs in certain areas, while other donors such as DE will expand their support in favor of the MPTF. The MPTF is an important and a key instrument for cooperation between the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia to realize the overall development goals of sustainable peace and development in Somalia.",

(F\u00f6r f\u00f6rdjupad bed\u00f6mning av UNFPA som strategisk parter i Somalia och av UNFPA:s landprogram 2018-2020, se beslut 28/2017, daterat 2017-06-22.) \n\nDessutom avses 60 MSEK \u00f6ronm\u00e4rkas till det s\u00e5 kallade \"Enablers programme\" som innefattar st\u00f6d till FNs riskhandteringsenhet, till avdelningen f\u00f6r s\u00e4kerhet och trygghet, samt till Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO) vilket bed\u00f6mds vara avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r alla utvecklingsinsatser i Somalia. \n\nAvtalsutkastet f\u00f6ljer den mellan UNDP och Sida \u00f6verenskomna mallen f\u00f6r den nu g\u00e4llande samarbetsformen. Det nya standardavtalet (Standard Administrative Arrangement, SAA)  kommer att anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att reglera Sveriges bidrag till fonden. Avtalet kommer att undertecknas av Sida och av UNDP som administrativ agent. En uppdragsbeskrivningen f\u00f6r MPTF samt ett Memorandum of Understanding mellan alla genomf\u00f6randeparter \u00e4r bilagda (utkast). Insatshanteringsregelns krav f\u00f6r avtal f\u00f6r SAA f\u00f6r FNs finansieringsf\u00f6nster \u00e4r uppfyllda. Vidare har ett Memorandum of Agreement ing\u00e5tts mellan FSG och UNDP som administrativ agent. \n\nDe juridiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r att kunna l\u00e4mna st\u00f6d \u00e4ven till det nationella f\u00f6nstret diskuteras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvrande  mellan Sida/JUR och FN i New York. Om och n\u00e4r dessa diskusioner \u00e4r avslutade kan ett eventuellt st\u00f6d till det nationella f\u00f6nstret bli f\u00f6rem\u00e5l f\u00f6r ett separat till\u00e4ggsbeslut.\n\nMPTF harmoniserar betydande resurser som kanaliseras inom FN i Somalia och bidrar d\u00e4rmed till ett koordinerat internationellt st\u00f6d till Somalia. Trots m\u00e5nga och allvarliga risker, \u00e4r det Sidas bed\u00f6mning att uppsatta m\u00e5l kommer att n\u00e5s till en rimlig grad om FN, deltagande givare och somaliska akt\u00f6rer samarbetar f\u00f6r att minska dessa risker. Sverige och andra givare kommer att spela en viktig roll i detta avseende.\n\nDet ska till\u00e4ggas att MPTF inte enbart utg\u00f6r en finansieringsmekanism, utan fungerar \u00e4ven som en plattform f\u00f6r givarkoordinering i bredare bem\u00e4rkelse och inbegriper de st\u00f6rsta givarna som EU, UK, USA, NO, DE, och DK. Fonden \u00e4r d\u00e4rmed ett viktigt och centralt instrument f\u00f6r det internationella givarsamfundet och den somaliska regeringen i deras samarbete f\u00f6r att f\u00f6rverkliga de \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5len om fred och utveckling i Somalia. Samtidigt b\u00f6rjar EU och UK delvis initiera nya bilaterala program inom specifika omr\u00e5den, medan andra givare s\u00e5som DE kommer att ut\u00f6ka sitt st\u00f6d till MPTF.",

        "description": "Somalia is ranked bottom in global indicators on gender inequality, maternal, reproductive and neonatal health and survival. One in 22 women dies every year due to pregnancy or childbirth related complications.  Neonatal deaths in children (i.e. deaths in children during the first 28 days of life) occur at a higher rate in Somalia than in any other country in the world (UNICEF 2016). Fertility in women is high with an average of 6.6 children per woman. At the same time, the incidence of gender-related violence among women including child marriages and forced marriage (more than 45 percent of girls under 18 years and one in 10 girls under 15 have been forced to marriages) and female gender mutilation (about 98 percent) are still high in the country. Women and girls have limited ability, if at all, to decide over their own bodies such when and whom to marry and when and how many children she wants and desires. Family planning still remains a difficult subject to openly discuss. Women seek these services in secrecy. \n\nUNFPA has after engagement by the embassy submitted a request to Sida for continued support to UNFPA:s country program document for the period 2011-2015, which has been formally extended until 31 December 2017. Focus for the CPD is on four key areas: 1) reproductive, maternal and neonatal health; 2) gender equality, with a special attention on SGBV; FGM and early marriage; 3) population data and statistiks; and 4) youh. Sweden has given support to UNFPA since 2014 within the framework of the previous joint health and nutrition program (JHNP) which ended in April 2017. Within the framework of JHNP, UNFPA has contributed to several important results, including: 1) training, quality assurance and registration of midwives; 2) maternal health services for pregnant women including increased access to modern contraception; 3) advocacy and community engagement in preventing female genital mutilation, child marriages, and violence against women; and 4) legal support towards for FGM and SGBV bill, both approved and adopted in Puntland region of Somalia while in federal government and in Somaliland the bills are awaiting parliament approval. UNFPA's work has a clear ownership of the Somali government and its federal administrations.\n\nIn addition to Sweden, UNFPA recieved new funding during 2017 from Finland, UK, Japan and Italy. Swedens longer-term support to UNFPA Somalia operations will be aligned with the new UNFPA Country Program Document (CPD) for the period 2018-2020, which is expected to be endorsed on the September board meeting in New York, and which will be part of the Swedens support to the UN Multi Partner Trust Fund Phase II which will be assessed during late autumn 2017.",

        "title": "UNICEF Enhancing the protection of children in armed conflict, 2017-2020",
        "description": "Every year, tens of thousands of boys and girls are recruited and used by armed groups worldwide. This is happening despite international agreements to end the use of children under the age of 18 in armed conflicts. The issue was highlighted further through Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 in Agenda 2030 that among other things calls for immediate and effective measures to eradicate the worst forms of child labour, including the recruitment and use of childsoldiers. Despite these commitments, children are used in armed conflicts and countries are experiencing enormous challenges in convincing fighting parties to release children and find ways to reintegrate them into society. \n\nChildren who are released have often gone through traumatic experiences and are sometimes imprisoned or stigmatized by communities who see them as a continued threat. UNICEF works closely with its partners to avoid that children are separated from their families and has, through advocacy with armed groups since 2016, assisted with the release of 22 500 children out of which 11 300 children have been reintegrated with their communities. Among the activities are psychosocial support, support to continued education and activities that increase social cohesion and peacebuilding. \n\nIn situations of protracted conflicts, there are often gaps in financing when emergency aid through humanitarian assistance often needs to focus on more urgent needs and where development cooperation yet has not been established. Support to the release and reintegration of children formerly associated with armed groups needs extended funding to be sustainable. In order to build resilience against re-recruitment and strengthen young boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 engagement and participation in peacebuilding in support of social cohesion, the gaps that occur between humanitarian and development aid need to be bridged. UNICEF works to bridge this gap through \u2018The New Way of Working\u2019 and has identified the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Somalia as three countries where more than 50% of the children that have been released from armed groups yet are to receive support to socio-economic reintegration programmes. Sida\u2019s support therefore aims at bridging this gap within the three country contexts in order to assist UNICEF in its work to release and reintegrate children in a more sustainable way. \nThe long-term goal of the intervention is \u201cTo contribute to ending and preventing grave violations committed against children in armed conflict, including the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups, and to supporting the release and reintegration of these children\u201d.",

        "description": "Den f\u00f6reslagna insatsen g\u00e4ller st\u00f6d till FN:s humanit\u00e4ra samordningsorgan OCHA:s (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) verksamhet p\u00e5 land- och regional niv\u00e5 i linje med dess nya strategiska plan f\u00f6r 2018-21. OCHA \u00e4r en entitet inom FN-sekretariatet, som har av FN:s generalf\u00f6rsamling (resolution 46/182, december 1991) erh\u00e5llit ett mandat att st\u00f6dja samordning av humanit\u00e4r respons. Den verkar globalt genom sitt huvudkvarter i New York och Geneve, 29 landkontor och sex regionala kontor.  \n\nDen FN-ledda humanit\u00e4ra samordningen \u00e4r en prioriterad fr\u00e5ga f\u00f6r svensk humanit\u00e4r politik. Sverige har sedan grundandet av OCHA bidragit b\u00e5de med ett stort finansiellt och ett viktigt politiskt st\u00f6d. Sverige \u00e4r idag efter USA och Storbritannien den tredje st\u00f6rsta givaren till OCHA och Sidas st\u00f6d har p\u00e5 senare \u00e5r st\u00e5tt f\u00f6r cirka h\u00e4lften av det totala svenska bidraget. Sverige \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 en av de st\u00f6rsta givarna till OCHA:s humanit\u00e4ra fonder, b\u00e5de landfonderna (CBPF) genom Sida och den centrala n\u00f6dfonden (CERF) genom bidrag fr\u00e5n UD. \n\nOCHA verkar i en global humanit\u00e4r milj\u00f6 d\u00e4r de humanit\u00e4ra behoven och komplexiteten st\u00e4ndigt \u00f6kar. I 2018 \u00e4r 136 miljoner m\u00e4nniskor i behov av humanit\u00e4rt bist\u00e5nd i 25 l\u00e4nder, av vilka de flesta \u00e4r i konflikt. Trots att den humanit\u00e4ra finansieringen totalt sett har \u00f6kat v\u00e4xer gapet mellan finansiering och behov. Under senare \u00e5r har enbart dryga h\u00e4lften av behoven finansierats och i 2018 v\u00e4djar man om sammanlagt om 22,5 miljarder dollar f\u00f6r att svara upp mot de FN-ledda gemensamma responsplanerna. Samtidigt m\u00e5ste systemet f\u00f6rh\u00e5lla sig till allt fler f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngda och kroniska kriser, ofta p\u00e5 grund av avsaknaden av h\u00e5llbara politiska l\u00f6sningar. Komplexiteten av kriserna f\u00f6rdjupas ytterligare av klimatrelaterade risker och naturkatastrofer. \u00c4ven det humanit\u00e4ra systemet \u00e4ndras och diversifieras i takt med att en allt st\u00f6rre del av responsen hanteras av lokala, nationella och regionala akt\u00f6rer.   \n\nMot ovan beskriva globala humanit\u00e4ra kontext OCHA:s merv\u00e4rde bed\u00f6mer Sida att behovet av effektiv humanit\u00e4r samordning \u00e4r fortsatt mycket stort. D\u00e4rf\u00f6r \u00e4r ett fortsatt st\u00f6d till OCHA:s samorning i f\u00e4lt motiverat. De samordningsmekansimer som OCHA tillhandah\u00e5ller \u00e4r en f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning f\u00f6r en behovsbaserad, v\u00e4lprioriterande kollektiv respons.\n\nOCHA:s merv\u00e4rde som humanit\u00e4r akt\u00f6r utg\u00e5r fr\u00e5n dess unika mandat, d\u00e4r den som icke-operativ akt\u00f6r kan agera som en oberoende facilitator och samordnare mellan de humanit\u00e4ra organisationer som deltar i en respons, b\u00e5de internationella och nationella. \n- Samordningsfunktionen innefattar bland annat den \u00e5rliga planeringscykeln, d\u00e4r OCHA f\u00f6r samman sektorgrupperna (sk. klustren) f\u00f6r att analysera behovsbilden f\u00f6r att sedan ta fram en gemensam humanit\u00e4r responsplan (Humanitarian Response Plan, HRP). De gemensamma responsplanerna \u00e4r ett viktigt led i att prioritera de mest akuta behoven och p\u00e5 s\u00e5 s\u00e4tt \u00e4ven utnyttja knappa finansiella resurser p\u00e5 ett effektivt s\u00e4tt. Sida erfar att genom OCHA:s och i vissa fall starka humanit\u00e4ra koordinatorers (Humanitarian Coordinator, HC) insatser har responsplaner blivit mer prioriterande och till st\u00f6rre grad begr\u00e4nsade till livr\u00e4ddande insatser. Samtidigt finns det fler exempel p\u00e5 att gemensam planering med utvecklingssystemet, som i l\u00e4ngden kan bidra till att minska humanit\u00e4ra behov. \n- I sin roll som oberoende facilitator kan OCHA ocks\u00e5 agera \u00e5 det humanit\u00e4ra systemets v\u00e4gnar mot myndigheter och milit\u00e4r, och p\u00e5 s\u00e5 s\u00e4tt till exempel f\u00f6rhandla om humanit\u00e4rt tilltr\u00e4de. Detta kan inneb\u00e4ra b\u00e5de f\u00f6rhandling om passage f\u00f6r enskilda hj\u00e4lpinsatser \u00f6ver konfliktgr\u00e4nser, om st\u00f6rre regelverk kring tilltr\u00e4de, eller exempelvis fr\u00e5gor kring registrering av organisationer och arbetstillst\u00e5nd f\u00f6r humanit\u00e4r personal i l\u00e4nder d\u00e4r myndigheter p\u00e5 s\u00e5 s\u00e4tt skapar hinder f\u00f6r en effektiv respons. Den h\u00e4r typen av samlade insatser \u00e4r av stor betydelse i den allt mer restriktiva milj\u00f6 som organisationer arbetar i. \n- Ett ytterligare exempel p\u00e5 den unika kompetens som OCHA tillf\u00f6r \u00e4r dess informationsprodukter och data-analys, som anv\u00e4nds som verktyg f\u00f6r operativa beslut och underlag f\u00f6r humanit\u00e4rt p\u00e5verkansarbete. \n\nSida bed\u00f6mer att OCHA:s merv\u00e4rde kommer under kommande \u00e5r ytterligare \u00f6ka i takt med att den strikt sektorbaserade responsen blir mindre relevant i f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngda kriser, och inte minst genom att flersektoriella modaliteter som kontantbaserade st\u00f6d vinner mark.  \n\nDenna insats bygger vidare p\u00e5 tidigare \u00e5rs st\u00f6d till OCHA och s\u00e4rskilt det avtal som Sida haft med OCHA under den tidigare strategiperioden 2014-18. Det utg\u00e5ngna avtalet inkluderade tv\u00e5-\u00e5riga finansierings\u00e5taganden f\u00f6r att bidra till f\u00f6ruts\u00e4gbarheten av OCHA:s finansiering. Fler\u00e5rig finansiering \u00e4r s\u00e4rskilt v\u00e4rdefullt f\u00f6r OCHA, vars budget best\u00e5r prim\u00e4rt av l\u00f6ner.  \n\nDet nya avtalet som f\u00f6resl\u00e5s \u00e4r fyra\u00e5rigt i linje med OCHA:s strategiska plan 2018-21. Insatsen \u00e4r uppdelad i tv\u00e5 komponenter. Den huvudsakliga komponenten best\u00e5r av st\u00f6d till OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor och kompletteras av ett mindre metodst\u00f6d till Gender Standby Capacity Project (GenCap) och Protection Standby Capacity Project (ProCap), som OCHA-st\u00e5r v\u00e4rd f\u00f6r.   \n\n1. OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor \n\nSt\u00f6det till OCHA:s f\u00e4ltkontor ges icke-\u00f6ronm\u00e4rkt till kontorens verksamhet i enlighet med OCHA:s strategiska plan och den \u00e5rliga verksamhetsplanen och budgeten (OCHA Plan and Budget). F\u00e4ltkontoren bidrar till alla fem av OCHA:s k\u00e4rnfunktioner genom att: (1) samordna den kollektiva humanit\u00e4ra responsen, inklusive genom gemensamma behovsbed\u00f6mningar och responsplaner; (2) bidra med informantionsprodukter och analys; (3) driva p\u00e5verkansarbete f\u00f6r att skydda drabbade m\u00e4nniskor och f\u00f6rhandla humanit\u00e4rt tilltr\u00e4de, (4) bidra till humanit\u00e4r policy och (5) mobilisera humanit\u00e4r finansiering. Insatsen kompletterar Sidas st\u00f6d till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna (ref. 52040531) som ocks\u00e5 hanteras av OCHA:s landkontor men finansieras direkt ur givarmedel till fonderna.\n\nSida genomf\u00f6r \u00e5rligen en humanit\u00e4r allokeringsprocess, vari samtliga humanit\u00e4ra kriser analyseras utifr\u00e5n de humanit\u00e4ra behoven och d\u00e4r de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utv\u00e4ljs. Det nu aktuella st\u00f6det till OCHA baseras d\u00e4rigenom p\u00e5 Sidas humanit\u00e4ra\nallokeringsprocess, vilken f\u00e4rdigst\u00e4lldes under slutet av 2017. Det f\u00f6reslagna st\u00f6det till OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor \u00e4r 118 miljoner kronor i 2018 och f\u00f6resl\u00e5s f\u00f6rdelas enligt nedan. \n\nLandkontor, totalt 84 miljoner kronor: Afghanistan 3, Burundi 1, Kamerun 4, Centralafrikanska republiken 5, Tchad 4, Colombia 2, DRK 7, Etiopien 2, Haiti 1, Irak 3, Libyen 1, Mali 4, Myanmar 2, Niger 4, Nigeria 4, Pakistan 3, Palestina 4, Filippinerna 1, Somalia 5, Sydsudan 5, Sudan 3, Syrienkrisen 10 (inklusive Regional HC's Office, Syrien, Turkiet, Libanon och Jordanien), Ukraina 1, Jemen 5.  \n\nRegionala kontor, totalt 14 miljoner kronor: Asien (Bangkok) 4, S\u00f6dra och \u00f6stra Afrika (Nairobi) 2, Mellan\u00f6stern och Nordafrika (Amman) 2, Stillahavsregionen (Suva) 1, V\u00e4stra och centrala Afrika (Dakar) 4, Latinamerika (Panama) 1. Av st\u00f6det till Asien-kontoret kommer 2 miljoner f\u00f6rdelas till OCHA:s verksamhet i Nordkorea.  \n\nEtt s\u00e4rskilt bidrag p\u00e5 20 miljoner kronor f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att avtalas och utbetalas som oallokerat st\u00f6d, som OCHA kan anv\u00e4nda under \u00e5ret f\u00f6r pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, kraftigt f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade eller underfinansierade kriser. De oallokerade medlen regleras genom avtalet som fastst\u00e4ller att OCHA ska inkomma med kompletterande underlag som skriftligen ska godk\u00e4nnas av Sida f\u00f6re medlen kan nyttjas av OCHA.\n\nInnanf\u00f6r bemyndiganderamen f\u00f6resl\u00e5s ett bidrag om 25 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2019, 5 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2020 och 5 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2021. De slutliga bidragen f\u00f6r 2019-21 kommande definieras som en del av Sidas \u00e5rliga, behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess och kr\u00e4ver separata beslut och avtalstill\u00e4gg, under f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning att riksdagen anvisar n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga finansiella medel.  \n\n2. GenCap och ProCap \n\nSt\u00f6d till GenCap och ProCap f\u00f6resl\u00e5s med 7 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018, av vilka 4 miljoner kronor f\u00f6rdelas till GenCap och 3 miljoner till ProCap, i enlighet med den \u00e5rliga GenCap-och ProCap-appellen. Syftet med projekten \u00e4r att skicka ut tekniska r\u00e5dgivare inom gender och skydd till st\u00f6d f\u00f6r den kollektiva humanit\u00e4ra responsen p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5. Uppdragen har ett systemfokus och verkar inom ramen f\u00f6r etablerade samordningsmekanismer, och kan d\u00e4rf\u00f6r ses som ett tematiskt komplement till st\u00f6det till OCHA. OCHA kommer inom kort inkomma med ett nytt strategiskt ramverk f\u00f6r GenCap och ProCap. Sidas bidrag avser att t\u00e4cka kostnaderna f\u00f6r de uts\u00e4nda experterna genom vidaref\u00f6rmedling till Norska flyktingr\u00e5det (NRC), som ansvarar f\u00f6r administrationen av expertrostern och uppdragen.      \n\nVad g\u00e4ller utbetalningar bed\u00f6mer Sida att samtliga medel f\u00f6r OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor ska utbetalas omg\u00e5ende. Detta f\u00f6r att p\u00e5 b\u00e4sta s\u00e4tt m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra planering och genomf\u00f6rande av den humanit\u00e4ra insatsen utan f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. Enligt OCHA anv\u00e4nds Sidas tidiga bidrag i n\u00e4ra anslutning till utbetalningen. Ett avsteg fr\u00e5n Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bed\u00f6ms d\u00e4rf\u00f6r motiverat. Medel till GenCap och ProCap (7 miljoner kronor) betalas ut f\u00f6rst efter att OCHA inkommit med kompletterande underlag i form av ett slutligt strategidokument, slutlig appell f\u00f6r 2018, och ett f\u00f6r Sida godtagbart utkast p\u00e5 resultatsramverk och en uppf\u00f6ljnings- och utv\u00e4rderingsplan. Det sistn\u00e4mna bed\u00f6ms vara tillg\u00e4ngligt under andra kvartalet 2018, allts\u00e5 ber\u00e4knas utbetalning ske senast i juni. En senare utbetalning \u00e4r motiverad eftersom det handlar om ett metodst\u00f6d, dvs. \u00e4r inte av livr\u00e4ddande karakt\u00e4r.   \n\n\nAvtalsutkastet har tagits fram i samr\u00e5d med ansvarig jurist p\u00e5 JUR och bygger p\u00e5 tidigare avtalsformat kompletterat med en ny reglering av parternas ambition att motverka anti-korruption. Skrivningen i artikel 11 skiljer sig \u00e5t i n\u00e5gra avseenden j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med Sidas avtal med OCHA om st\u00f6det till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna (se beslut 2018-000231). Skillnaderna avser rapportering av \u00e4renden och ansvaret f\u00f6r utredningar vilka regleras n\u00e5got olika beroende p\u00e5 om FN:s interna regelverk f\u00f6r Sekretariatet g\u00e4ller n\u00e4r OCHA har ett samlat ansvar f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet (s\u00e5som i det f\u00f6reslagna st\u00f6det) j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med rollen som koordinator inom FN-systemet vad g\u00e4ller landfonderna genom vilket ansvaret \u00e4r f\u00f6rdelat p\u00e5 de implementerande organisationerna. Som st\u00f6d f\u00f6r den f\u00f6reslagna lydelsen har OCHA delat g\u00e4llande regelverk f\u00f6r Sekretariatet mot antikorruption (beslutat Sept 2016: \u201dUnited Nations Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework\u201d ) och \u00e4ven delat det interna regelverket f\u00f6r upphandling som g\u00e4ller f\u00f6r hela FN-systemet (\u201dUnited Nations Procurement Manual, revision 7\u201dJuli 2013). Sida bed\u00f6mer att regelverken \u00e4r tillfredsst\u00e4llande.\n\nBed\u00f6mningspromemorian har skrivits p\u00e5 engelska med anledning av att engelskspr\u00e5kig personal i f\u00e4lt \u00e4r delaktig i beredning och uppf\u00f6ljning av insatsen, i enlighet med generaldirekt\u00f6rens beslut om Sidas spr\u00e5kvalsmatris med till\u00e4mpningsanvisningar fr\u00e5n den 1 mars 2013 (n\u00e4r s\u00e5 \u00e4r motiverat)",

        "description": "The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) is the UN\u2019s capital investment agency for the world\u2019s 47 Least Developed Countries (LDCs). UNCDF uses its capital mandate to help LDCs pursue inclusive growth through financing inclusive financial systems and by facilitating access to capital for e.g. climate resilence investments. UNCDF is affiliated to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and is included by their processes, policies and regulations.The Contribution includes The Last Mile Finance Trust Fund (LMFTF) which includes the finance mechanism The Booster Fund as well as the programme Better than Cash Alliance (BtCA) which is hosted by UNCDF. The total sum of the intervention is 189 million SEK to be disbursed during the period 2019-2021, including an annual contribution of 8 million SEK to BtCA.Within the framework of LMFTF there are multiple programs:- CleanStart, a program with the goal of providing 500 000 people with clean energy solutions (e.g. solar panels, mini grids, clean cooking stoves) through investments- Making Access Possible, an initiative to support financial inclusion through analysis and road mapping- DF+, which creates digital financial solutions for innovations which contribute to the SDGs - MicroLead, a global initiative that challenges financial service actors to develop, test and upscale deposit services for people with low incomes, especially rural women- The Finance for Food Security, which works for food security and against malnutrition through encouraging local, gender sensitive investments to fill the gaps of the local food system- IELD, which works with central and local governments to build capacity for gender responsive economic policy and seeks to identify hindrances for female participation in economic activity - Municipal Investments Finance, which supports municipalities in inproving the access to finance services, focusing on secondary cities within LDCs, as opposed to merely capital cities. Programmes within the Booster Fund (also par of the overall LMFTF umbrella):- Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL), which works with integrating climate adaption in local governments' planning and budgeting- EcoBonds, seeking to emit bonds on a municipal level for investments contributing to resilience- Local Finance Initiative (LFI), which seeks to establish local development units within the central administration of Tanzania and Uganda, supporting local development investments- CleanStart, a program with the goal of providing 500 000 people with clean energy solutions through investmentsThe third component, an independent program that is hosted by UNCDF \u2013 Better than Cash Alliance (BtCA) \u2013 is an alliance of countries and multi-national companies active in the digitalisation of payments. The purpose of BtCA is to enable digital payment solutions in order to build an including digital economy that contributes to the SDGs.To exemplify UNCDF's work, in Bangladesh a UNCDF project developed models for participatory decision making on climate adaptive and resilient investments in local infrastructure. Successful pilot projects lead to the national government giving their support to the project, funding it and propelling the program to the degree that it was not possible for UNCDF to further house the project. As an example of BtCA's work the government of Ethiopia has requested the Alliance to support the development of the National Digital Payments Strategy in order to accelerate the government\u2019s plans to digitize payments and the economy.Through these mechanisms, the final goal of the intervention is to create including, equal and resilient financial markets and local financial systems that are more efficient in their ability to strengthen poor people, SMEs and local governments in the least developed countries.",

Allokeringsprocessen utmynnar i att de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utv\u00e4ljs, vilket bland annat baseras p\u00e5 organisationernas relevans och effektivitet enligt iakttagelser fr\u00e5n tidigare f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljning. Det nu aktuella st\u00f6det till Action Against Hunger (AAH) baseras p\u00e5 Sidas humanit\u00e4ra allokeringsprocess, som f\u00e4rdigst\u00e4lldes under slutet av 2017. \n\nAktuell insats bygger vidare p\u00e5 tidigare \u00e5rs st\u00f6d till AAH, som tidigare gick under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF). Sidas \u00e5rliga st\u00f6d till AAH bef\u00e4stes 2014 d\u00e5 ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett tre\u00e5rigt avtal, signerades. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6regicks av en djupdykande utv\u00e4rdering, vilken bland annat framlyfte AAH:s goda expertis och renomm\u00e9 inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngdes senare f\u00f6r att \u00e4ven inkludera 2017. Ett nytt tre\u00e5rigt avtal (2018-2020) f\u00f6resl\u00e5s nu f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en fortsatt strategisk ansats i relation och partnerskap med AAH. Det nu f\u00f6reslagna st\u00f6det avses kompletteras med ytterligare st\u00f6d genom st\u00f6rre \u00e4ndringar av insatsen, i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel (\u00a7 3.4.2), f\u00f6r \u00e5ren 2018-2020. Kompletterande medelstill\u00e4gg f\u00f6ruts\u00e4tter att riksdagen anvisar n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga finansiella medel samt baseras p\u00e5 bed\u00f6md relevans i kommande allokeringsprocesser. \n\nTotalt f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att 201 miljoner kronor allokeras till Action Against Hunger f\u00f6r implementeringen av humanit\u00e4ra hj\u00e4lpinsatser i initialt 18 l\u00e4nder. F\u00f6r \u00f6verblick och f\u00f6rdelning av st\u00f6d h\u00e4nvisas till avtalets bilaga V (Budget summary).\n\nSt\u00f6det utg\u00e5r fr\u00e5n fyra delkomponenter: \n\n1.\tPROJEKTST\u00d6D. I 13 av l\u00e4nderna sker finansiering i form av projektst\u00f6d, d\u00e4r Sidas st\u00f6d g\u00e5r till specifika projekt med tydlig information kring projektets inriktning samt hur st\u00f6det kommer att implementeras. \n\nF\u00f6r 2019 och 2020 f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att 13 miljoner kronor respektive 8 miljoner kronor allokeras till AAH f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra fler\u00e5riga st\u00f6d till tv\u00e5 av de ovan n\u00e4mnda projekten. Genom s\u00e4krad fler\u00e5rig finansiering f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas de tv\u00e5 projekten uppn\u00e5 mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga och h\u00e5llbara resultat. \n\nEtt tv\u00e5\u00e5rigt st\u00f6d till Jemen har f\u00f6r avsikt att st\u00e4rka AAH:s m\u00f6jlighet att bygga starka och l\u00e5ngsiktiga relationer med relevanta akt\u00f6rer, med en f\u00f6rhoppning om att AAH kan etablera n\u00e4rvaro i f\u00f6r\u00e4nderliga och sv\u00e5rtillg\u00e4ngliga omr\u00e5den. \n\nEtt tre\u00e5rigt st\u00f6d till Uganda, vilket genom en stegvis implementeringsmodell syftar till att st\u00e4rka Sydsudanesiska flyktingars m\u00f6jlighet till sj\u00e4lvf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning. M\u00e5let f\u00f6r AAH \u00e4r att efter tre \u00e5r fasa ut sitt st\u00f6d till ber\u00f6rda flyktingar, alternativt att de \u00f6verg\u00e5r till andra, mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga st\u00f6dformer. \n\n2.\tPROGRAMST\u00d6D. I \u00f6vriga fem l\u00e4nder har Sida f\u00f6r avsikt att i linje med den av regeringen antagna Grand Bargain, vilken \u00e4r en \u00f6verenskommelse som syftar till att effektivisera och minska kostnaderna av humanit\u00e4r hj\u00e4lp till n\u00f6dlidande, ge st\u00f6d i form av en programbaserad ansats. Detta \u00e4r en st\u00f6dform som ger AAH m\u00f6jlighet att flexibelt allokera st\u00f6det till ej f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda humanit\u00e4ra behov inom l\u00e4nderna. Detta under f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning att insatserna faller inom l\u00e4ndernas respektive FN-ledda humanit\u00e4ra responsplaner samt de programdokument AAH har inkommit med till Sida. \n\n3.\tRAPID RESPONSE MECHANISM. Av den initiala allokeringen utg\u00f6r 35 miljoner kronor st\u00f6d i form av modellen Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), vilket ger AAH flexibilitet att snabbt tillskjuta medel till nya insatser som syftar till att besvara pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, och f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra behov. Sida m\u00e5ste dock, enligt avtal, godk\u00e4nna AAH:s f\u00f6rslag p\u00e5 n\u00e4r och var RRM-medlen kan nyttjas, vilket kan g\u00f6ras inom 24 timmar. \n\n4.\tMETODST\u00d6D. 2,2 miljoner kronor av den initiala allokeringen g\u00e5r till ett metodst\u00f6d, vilket syftar till att st\u00e4rka datainsamling och analys kopplad till undern\u00e4ring i Afrikas horn. \n\n\n\nBAKGRUND\n\nAction Against Hunger (AAH) grundades i Paris, Frankrike, 1979 f\u00f6r att bland annat ge st\u00f6d till afghanska flyktingar i Pakistan samt matos\u00e4kra hush\u00e5ll i Uganda. AAH har sedan dess vuxit kontinuerligt, och utg\u00f6r i dag en av de st\u00f6rsta humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rerna inom sitt huvudmandat; det vill s\u00e4ga, nutrition och mats\u00e4kerhet. Action Against Hunger gick tidigare under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF), men valde att byta namn f\u00f6r att s\u00e4tta en mer internationell pr\u00e4gel p\u00e5 organisationen.\n\nUnder 1990-talet utvecklade AAH ett internationellt n\u00e4tverk, vars styrelse i dag best\u00e5r av medlemmarna AAH Frankrike (Sidas avtalspartner), AAH Indien, AAH Kanada, AAH Spanien, AAH Storbritannien och AAH USA. AAH:s internationella n\u00e4tverk delar en strategisk plan, och medlemmarna har gemensamt framtagit en rad principer, som till exempel neutralitet, transparens och icke-diskriminering, vilka de alla lyder under. Tillsammans har de ocks\u00e5 utarbetat ett gemensamt f\u00f6rh\u00e5llningss\u00e4tt till bland annat anti-korruptionsfr\u00e5gor. P\u00e5 medlemsniv\u00e5 har detta \u00f6versatts till separata anti-korruptionspolicys samt uppf\u00f6randekoder (code of conducts), som tillsammans med sina annex fastst\u00e4ller n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarnas nolltolerans mot sexuella \u00f6vergrepp och maktmissbruk. Ansvar och samording av AAH:s operativa verksamhet p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 har uppdelats mellan de tre medlemmarna AAH Frankrike, AAH Spanien och AAH USA: \n\nAAH FRANKRIKE (Sidas avtalspartner)\nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Centralafrikanska Republiken, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Djibouti, Elfenbenskusten, Etiopien, Indien, Irak, Jemen, Jordanien, Kamerun, Liberia, Madagaskar, Myanmar, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Tchad, Ukraina, Zimbabwe. \n\nAAH SPANIEN\nBolivia, Colombia, Egypten, Guinea, Libanon, Malawi, Mali, Mauretanien, Niger, Palestina, Peru, Senegal, Sudan, Syrien, S\u00f6dra Kaukasus, Turkiet.  \n\nAAH USA\nCambodia, Haiti, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Sydsudan, Tanzania, Uganda. \n\nDe olika n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarna \u00e4r separata juridiska personer, vilket inneb\u00e4r att Sidas medel per definition vidaref\u00f6rmedlas i insatser som implementeras av n\u00e5got av AAH Spaniens och AAH USA:s landkontor. F\u00f6r 2018 inneb\u00e4r det, per den initiala allokeringen, att 57,3 % av Sidas st\u00f6d stannar inom AAH Frankrike, samtidigt som 17,1 % vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till AAH Spanien och 24,1 % till AAH USA. Resterande 1,5 % av 2018 \u00e5rs intiala st\u00f6d vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till AAH Kanada f\u00f6r implementering av metodst\u00f6det SMART. \n\n\n\nVERKSAMHET OCH MERV\u00c4RDE \n\nAAH:s vision \u00e4r en v\u00e4rld fri fr\u00e5n hunger, d\u00e4r s\u00e5v\u00e4l barn som vuxna har tillr\u00e4ckligt med mat och vatten, samt andra n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga resurser, f\u00f6r att uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5lla ett v\u00e4rdigt liv. Organisationens huvudmandat ligger inom livr\u00e4ddande insatser som syftar till att utrota f\u00f6rekomsten av hunger genom att f\u00f6rebygga, uppt\u00e4cka och behandla undern\u00e4ring, samt att bem\u00f6ta de underliggande orsakerna till hunger.  \n\nAAH bed\u00f6ms av Sida ha en viktig expertis och kompetens inom den humanit\u00e4ra verksamheten att arbeta med fr\u00e5gor kring nutrition och sektorer i dess n\u00e4ra anslutning s\u00e5som livsmedelsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten och sanitet samt h\u00e4lsa. AAH arbetar med de mest utsatta grupperna i m\u00e5nga av de stora humanit\u00e4ra kriserna. Jemen, Syrien och Sydsudan kan n\u00e4mnas som exempel, d\u00e4r AAH bland annat bist\u00e5r kritiskt undern\u00e4rda barn med n\u00e4ringstillskott. Genom st\u00f6d till AAH bidrar Sida ocks\u00e5 till att skapa f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar f\u00f6r mer h\u00e5llbara resultat inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Humanit\u00e4ra hj\u00e4lpinsatser kompletteras ofta med aktiviteter, som exempelvis utbildningstillf\u00e4llen inom sanitet och nutrition, vilka syftar till att st\u00e4rka utsatta m\u00e4nniskors motst\u00e5ndskraft. Sida har goda erfarenheter av AAH:s f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att snabbt svara p\u00e5 behov till f\u00f6ljd av pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt eskalerande kriser.\n\nAAH:s merv\u00e4rde som humanit\u00e4r partnerorganisation till Sida ligger i organisationens huvudmandat inom omr\u00e5det f\u00f6r nutrition, vilket kan p\u00e5visas genom att AAH: \n\nA.\tHar etablerad n\u00e4rvaro i majoriteten av v\u00e4rldens humanit\u00e4ra kriser. Med tre regionala kontor, 50 landkontor och totalt 8 000 medarbetare har AAH f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna, samt kapaciteten, att bist\u00e5 m\u00e4nniskor som \u00e4r i behov av st\u00f6d. \n\nB.\tTack vare sin etablerade n\u00e4rvaro, snabbt kan n\u00e5 ut till m\u00e4nniskor vid pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra kriser. AAH har, genom redan anst\u00e4lld personal, m\u00f6jlighet att vid humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer snabbt uts\u00e4nda personal, med gedigen erfarenhet av liknande krissituationer, som st\u00f6d till ber\u00f6rda landkontor. AAH:s snabba responskapacitet kunde bland annat ses i insatser som svarade upp mot humanit\u00e4ra behov kopplade till evakueringen av Mosul, Irak, 2017 samt vid den hastigt eskalerande flyktingstr\u00f6mmen fr\u00e5n Norra Rakhine, Myanmar, till Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, under slutet av 2017. \n\nC.\tVid implementeringen av insatser ofta anv\u00e4nder sig av en integrerad ansats, d\u00e4r undern\u00e4ringsproblematiken per kontext analyseras grundligt f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla en effektiv humanit\u00e4r respons. Insatser som syftar till att minska f\u00f6rekomsten av undern\u00e4ring, integrerar ofta, ut\u00f6ver medicinsk behandling med n\u00e4ringstillskott, komponenter inom livsmedelf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten, sanitet och h\u00e4lsa samt psykosocialt st\u00f6d. P\u00e5 s\u00e5 vis kan mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga och h\u00e5llbara l\u00f6sningar n\u00e5s. \n\nAAH:s n\u00e4tverksmedlemmar \u00e4r i regel direktimplementerande.

Allokeringsprocessen utmynnar i att de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utv\u00e4ljs, vilket bland annat baseras p\u00e5 organisationernas relevans och effektivitet enligt iakttagelser fr\u00e5n tidigare f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljning. Det nu aktuella st\u00f6det till Action Against Hunger (AAH) baseras p\u00e5 Sidas humanit\u00e4ra allokeringsprocess, som f\u00e4rdigst\u00e4lldes under slutet av 2017. \n\nAktuell insats bygger vidare p\u00e5 tidigare \u00e5rs st\u00f6d till AAH, som tidigare gick under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF). Sidas \u00e5rliga st\u00f6d till AAH bef\u00e4stes 2014 d\u00e5 ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett tre\u00e5rigt avtal, signerades. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6regicks av en djupdykande utv\u00e4rdering, vilken bland annat framlyfte AAH:s goda expertis och renomm\u00e9 inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngdes senare f\u00f6r att \u00e4ven inkludera 2017. Ett nytt tre\u00e5rigt avtal (2018-2020) f\u00f6resl\u00e5s nu f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en fortsatt strategisk ansats i relation och partnerskap med AAH. Det nu f\u00f6reslagna st\u00f6det avses kompletteras med ytterligare st\u00f6d genom st\u00f6rre \u00e4ndringar av insatsen, i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel (\u00a7 3.4.2), f\u00f6r \u00e5ren 2018-2020. Kompletterande medelstill\u00e4gg f\u00f6ruts\u00e4tter att riksdagen anvisar n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga finansiella medel samt baseras p\u00e5 bed\u00f6md relevans i kommande allokeringsprocesser. \n\nTotalt f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att 201 miljoner kronor allokeras till Action Against Hunger f\u00f6r implementeringen av humanit\u00e4ra hj\u00e4lpinsatser i initialt 18 l\u00e4nder. F\u00f6r \u00f6verblick och f\u00f6rdelning av st\u00f6d h\u00e4nvisas till avtalets bilaga V (Budget summary).\n\nSt\u00f6det utg\u00e5r fr\u00e5n fyra delkomponenter: \n\n1.\tPROJEKTST\u00d6D. I 13 av l\u00e4nderna sker finansiering i form av projektst\u00f6d, d\u00e4r Sidas st\u00f6d g\u00e5r till specifika projekt med tydlig information kring projektets inriktning samt hur st\u00f6det kommer att implementeras. \n\nF\u00f6r 2019 och 2020 f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att 13 miljoner kronor respektive 8 miljoner kronor allokeras till AAH f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra fler\u00e5riga st\u00f6d till tv\u00e5 av de ovan n\u00e4mnda projekten. Genom s\u00e4krad fler\u00e5rig finansiering f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas de tv\u00e5 projekten uppn\u00e5 mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga och h\u00e5llbara resultat. \n\nEtt tv\u00e5\u00e5rigt st\u00f6d till Jemen har f\u00f6r avsikt att st\u00e4rka AAH:s m\u00f6jlighet att bygga starka och l\u00e5ngsiktiga relationer med relevanta akt\u00f6rer, med en f\u00f6rhoppning om att AAH kan etablera n\u00e4rvaro i f\u00f6r\u00e4nderliga och sv\u00e5rtillg\u00e4ngliga omr\u00e5den. \n\nEtt tre\u00e5rigt st\u00f6d till Uganda, vilket genom en stegvis implementeringsmodell syftar till att st\u00e4rka Sydsudanesiska flyktingars m\u00f6jlighet till sj\u00e4lvf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning. M\u00e5let f\u00f6r AAH \u00e4r att efter tre \u00e5r fasa ut sitt st\u00f6d till ber\u00f6rda flyktingar, alternativt att de \u00f6verg\u00e5r till andra, mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga st\u00f6dformer. \n\n2.\tPROGRAMST\u00d6D. I \u00f6vriga fem l\u00e4nder har Sida f\u00f6r avsikt att i linje med den av regeringen antagna Grand Bargain, vilken \u00e4r en \u00f6verenskommelse som syftar till att effektivisera och minska kostnaderna av humanit\u00e4r hj\u00e4lp till n\u00f6dlidande, ge st\u00f6d i form av en programbaserad ansats. Detta \u00e4r en st\u00f6dform som ger AAH m\u00f6jlighet att flexibelt allokera st\u00f6det till ej f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda humanit\u00e4ra behov inom l\u00e4nderna. Detta under f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning att insatserna faller inom l\u00e4ndernas respektive FN-ledda humanit\u00e4ra responsplaner samt de programdokument AAH har inkommit med till Sida. \n\n3.\tRAPID RESPONSE MECHANISM. Av den initiala allokeringen utg\u00f6r 35 miljoner kronor st\u00f6d i form av modellen Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), vilket ger AAH flexibilitet att snabbt tillskjuta medel till nya insatser som syftar till att besvara pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, och f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra behov. Sida m\u00e5ste dock, enligt avtal, godk\u00e4nna AAH:s f\u00f6rslag p\u00e5 n\u00e4r och var RRM-medlen kan nyttjas, vilket kan g\u00f6ras inom 24 timmar. \n\n4.\tMETODST\u00d6D. 2,2 miljoner kronor av den initiala allokeringen g\u00e5r till ett metodst\u00f6d, vilket syftar till att st\u00e4rka datainsamling och analys kopplad till undern\u00e4ring i Afrikas horn. \n\n\n\nBAKGRUND\n\nAction Against Hunger (AAH) grundades i Paris, Frankrike, 1979 f\u00f6r att bland annat ge st\u00f6d till afghanska flyktingar i Pakistan samt matos\u00e4kra hush\u00e5ll i Uganda. AAH har sedan dess vuxit kontinuerligt, och utg\u00f6r i dag en av de st\u00f6rsta humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rerna inom sitt huvudmandat; det vill s\u00e4ga, nutrition och mats\u00e4kerhet. Action Against Hunger gick tidigare under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF), men valde att byta namn f\u00f6r att s\u00e4tta en mer internationell pr\u00e4gel p\u00e5 organisationen.\n\nUnder 1990-talet utvecklade AAH ett internationellt n\u00e4tverk, vars styrelse i dag best\u00e5r av medlemmarna AAH Frankrike (Sidas avtalspartner), AAH Indien, AAH Kanada, AAH Spanien, AAH Storbritannien och AAH USA. AAH:s internationella n\u00e4tverk delar en strategisk plan, och medlemmarna har gemensamt framtagit en rad principer, som till exempel neutralitet, transparens och icke-diskriminering, vilka de alla lyder under. Tillsammans har de ocks\u00e5 utarbetat ett gemensamt f\u00f6rh\u00e5llningss\u00e4tt till bland annat anti-korruptionsfr\u00e5gor. P\u00e5 medlemsniv\u00e5 har detta \u00f6versatts till separata anti-korruptionspolicys samt uppf\u00f6randekoder (code of conducts), som tillsammans med sina annex fastst\u00e4ller n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarnas nolltolerans mot sexuella \u00f6vergrepp och maktmissbruk. Ansvar och samording av AAH:s operativa verksamhet p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 har uppdelats mellan de tre medlemmarna AAH Frankrike, AAH Spanien och AAH USA: \n\nAAH FRANKRIKE (Sidas avtalspartner)\nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Centralafrikanska Republiken, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Djibouti, Elfenbenskusten, Etiopien, Indien, Irak, Jemen, Jordanien, Kamerun, Liberia, Madagaskar, Myanmar, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Tchad, Ukraina, Zimbabwe. \n\nAAH SPANIEN\nBolivia, Colombia, Egypten, Guinea, Libanon, Malawi, Mali, Mauretanien, Niger, Palestina, Peru, Senegal, Sudan, Syrien, S\u00f6dra Kaukasus, Turkiet.  \n\nAAH USA\nCambodia, Haiti, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Sydsudan, Tanzania, Uganda. \n\nDe olika n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarna \u00e4r separata juridiska personer, vilket inneb\u00e4r att Sidas medel per definition vidaref\u00f6rmedlas i insatser som implementeras av n\u00e5got av AAH Spaniens och AAH USA:s landkontor. F\u00f6r 2018 inneb\u00e4r det, per den initiala allokeringen, att 57,3 % av Sidas st\u00f6d stannar inom AAH Frankrike, samtidigt som 17,1 % vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till AAH Spanien och 24,1 % till AAH USA. Resterande 1,5 % av 2018 \u00e5rs intiala st\u00f6d vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till AAH Kanada f\u00f6r implementering av metodst\u00f6det SMART. \n\n\n\nVERKSAMHET OCH MERV\u00c4RDE \n\nAAH:s vision \u00e4r en v\u00e4rld fri fr\u00e5n hunger, d\u00e4r s\u00e5v\u00e4l barn som vuxna har tillr\u00e4ckligt med mat och vatten, samt andra n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga resurser, f\u00f6r att uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5lla ett v\u00e4rdigt liv. Organisationens huvudmandat ligger inom livr\u00e4ddande insatser som syftar till att utrota f\u00f6rekomsten av hunger genom att f\u00f6rebygga, uppt\u00e4cka och behandla undern\u00e4ring, samt att bem\u00f6ta de underliggande orsakerna till hunger.  \n\nAAH bed\u00f6ms av Sida ha en viktig expertis och kompetens inom den humanit\u00e4ra verksamheten att arbeta med fr\u00e5gor kring nutrition och sektorer i dess n\u00e4ra anslutning s\u00e5som livsmedelsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten och sanitet samt h\u00e4lsa. AAH arbetar med de mest utsatta grupperna i m\u00e5nga av de stora humanit\u00e4ra kriserna. Jemen, Syrien och Sydsudan kan n\u00e4mnas som exempel, d\u00e4r AAH bland annat bist\u00e5r kritiskt undern\u00e4rda barn med n\u00e4ringstillskott. Genom st\u00f6d till AAH bidrar Sida ocks\u00e5 till att skapa f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar f\u00f6r mer h\u00e5llbara resultat inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Humanit\u00e4ra hj\u00e4lpinsatser kompletteras ofta med aktiviteter, som exempelvis utbildningstillf\u00e4llen inom sanitet och nutrition, vilka syftar till att st\u00e4rka utsatta m\u00e4nniskors motst\u00e5ndskraft. Sida har goda erfarenheter av AAH:s f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att snabbt svara p\u00e5 behov till f\u00f6ljd av pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt eskalerande kriser.\n\nAAH:s merv\u00e4rde som humanit\u00e4r partnerorganisation till Sida ligger i organisationens huvudmandat inom omr\u00e5det f\u00f6r nutrition, vilket kan p\u00e5visas genom att AAH: \n\nA.\tHar etablerad n\u00e4rvaro i majoriteten av v\u00e4rldens humanit\u00e4ra kriser. Med tre regionala kontor, 50 landkontor och totalt 8 000 medarbetare har AAH f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna, samt kapaciteten, att bist\u00e5 m\u00e4nniskor som \u00e4r i behov av st\u00f6d. \n\nB.\tTack vare sin etablerade n\u00e4rvaro, snabbt kan n\u00e5 ut till m\u00e4nniskor vid pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra kriser. AAH har, genom redan anst\u00e4lld personal, m\u00f6jlighet att vid humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer snabbt uts\u00e4nda personal, med gedigen erfarenhet av liknande krissituationer, som st\u00f6d till ber\u00f6rda landkontor. AAH:s snabba responskapacitet kunde bland annat ses i insatser som svarade upp mot humanit\u00e4ra behov kopplade till evakueringen av Mosul, Irak, 2017 samt vid den hastigt eskalerande flyktingstr\u00f6mmen fr\u00e5n Norra Rakhine, Myanmar, till Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, under slutet av 2017. \n\nC.\tVid implementeringen av insatser ofta anv\u00e4nder sig av en integrerad ansats, d\u00e4r undern\u00e4ringsproblematiken per kontext analyseras grundligt f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla en effektiv humanit\u00e4r respons. Insatser som syftar till att minska f\u00f6rekomsten av undern\u00e4ring, integrerar ofta, ut\u00f6ver medicinsk behandling med n\u00e4ringstillskott, komponenter inom livsmedelf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten, sanitet och h\u00e4lsa samt psykosocialt st\u00f6d. P\u00e5 s\u00e5 vis kan mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga och h\u00e5llbara l\u00f6sningar n\u00e5s. \n\nAAH:s n\u00e4tverksmedlemmar \u00e4r i regel direktimplementerande. Samtidigt har de f\u00f6r avsikt att, inom ramen f\u00f6r Grand Bargains lokaliseringsagenda, senast 2020 implementera 20 % av sina insatser genom lokala partnerorganisationer.

Allokeringsprocessen utmynnar i att de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utv\u00e4ljs, vilket bland annat baseras p\u00e5 organisationernas relevans och effektivitet enligt iakttagelser fr\u00e5n tidigare f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljning. Det nu aktuella st\u00f6det till Action Against Hunger (AAH) baseras p\u00e5 Sidas humanit\u00e4ra allokeringsprocess, som f\u00e4rdigst\u00e4lldes under slutet av 2017. \n\nAktuell insats bygger vidare p\u00e5 tidigare \u00e5rs st\u00f6d till AAH, som tidigare gick under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF). Sidas \u00e5rliga st\u00f6d till AAH bef\u00e4stes 2014 d\u00e5 ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett tre\u00e5rigt avtal, signerades. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6regicks av en djupdykande utv\u00e4rdering, vilken bland annat framlyfte AAH:s goda expertis och renomm\u00e9 inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngdes senare f\u00f6r att \u00e4ven inkludera 2017. Ett nytt tre\u00e5rigt avtal (2018-2020) f\u00f6resl\u00e5s nu f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en fortsatt strategisk ansats i relation och partnerskap med AAH. Det nu f\u00f6reslagna st\u00f6det avses kompletteras med ytterligare st\u00f6d genom st\u00f6rre \u00e4ndringar av insatsen, i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel (\u00a7 3.4.2), f\u00f6r \u00e5ren 2018-2020. Kompletterande medelstill\u00e4gg f\u00f6ruts\u00e4tter att riksdagen anvisar n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga finansiella medel samt baseras p\u00e5 bed\u00f6md relevans i kommande allokeringsprocesser. \n\nTotalt f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att 201 miljoner kronor allokeras till Action Against Hunger f\u00f6r implementeringen av humanit\u00e4ra hj\u00e4lpinsatser i initialt 18 l\u00e4nder. F\u00f6r \u00f6verblick och f\u00f6rdelning av st\u00f6d h\u00e4nvisas till avtalets bilaga V (Budget summary).\n\nSt\u00f6det utg\u00e5r fr\u00e5n fyra delkomponenter: \n\n1.\tPROJEKTST\u00d6D. I 13 av l\u00e4nderna sker finansiering i form av projektst\u00f6d, d\u00e4r Sidas st\u00f6d g\u00e5r till specifika projekt med tydlig information kring projektets inriktning samt hur st\u00f6det kommer att implementeras. \n\nF\u00f6r 2019 och 2020 f\u00f6resl\u00e5s att 13 miljoner kronor respektive 8 miljoner kronor allokeras till AAH f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra fler\u00e5riga st\u00f6d till tv\u00e5 av de ovan n\u00e4mnda projekten. Genom s\u00e4krad fler\u00e5rig finansiering f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas de tv\u00e5 projekten uppn\u00e5 mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga och h\u00e5llbara resultat. \n\nEtt tv\u00e5\u00e5rigt st\u00f6d till Jemen har f\u00f6r avsikt att st\u00e4rka AAH:s m\u00f6jlighet att bygga starka och l\u00e5ngsiktiga relationer med relevanta akt\u00f6rer, med en f\u00f6rhoppning om att AAH kan etablera n\u00e4rvaro i f\u00f6r\u00e4nderliga och sv\u00e5rtillg\u00e4ngliga omr\u00e5den. \n\nEtt tre\u00e5rigt st\u00f6d till Uganda, vilket genom en stegvis implementeringsmodell syftar till att st\u00e4rka Sydsudanesiska flyktingars m\u00f6jlighet till sj\u00e4lvf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning. M\u00e5let f\u00f6r AAH \u00e4r att efter tre \u00e5r fasa ut sitt st\u00f6d till ber\u00f6rda flyktingar, alternativt att de \u00f6verg\u00e5r till andra, mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga st\u00f6dformer. \n\n2.\tPROGRAMST\u00d6D. I \u00f6vriga fem l\u00e4nder har Sida f\u00f6r avsikt att i linje med den av regeringen antagna Grand Bargain, vilken \u00e4r en \u00f6verenskommelse som syftar till att effektivisera och minska kostnaderna av humanit\u00e4r hj\u00e4lp till n\u00f6dlidande, ge st\u00f6d i form av en programbaserad ansats. Detta \u00e4r en st\u00f6dform som ger AAH m\u00f6jlighet att flexibelt allokera st\u00f6det till ej f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda humanit\u00e4ra behov inom l\u00e4nderna. Detta under f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning att insatserna faller inom l\u00e4ndernas respektive FN-ledda humanit\u00e4ra responsplaner samt de programdokument AAH har inkommit med till Sida. \n\n3.\tRAPID RESPONSE MECHANISM. Av den initiala allokeringen utg\u00f6r 35 miljoner kronor st\u00f6d i form av modellen Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), vilket ger AAH flexibilitet att snabbt tillskjuta medel till nya insatser som syftar till att besvara pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, och f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra behov. Sida m\u00e5ste dock, enligt avtal, godk\u00e4nna AAH:s f\u00f6rslag p\u00e5 n\u00e4r och var RRM-medlen kan nyttjas, vilket kan g\u00f6ras inom 24 timmar. \n\n4.\tMETODST\u00d6D. 2,2 miljoner kronor av den initiala allokeringen g\u00e5r till ett metodst\u00f6d, vilket syftar till att st\u00e4rka datainsamling och analys kopplad till undern\u00e4ring i Afrikas horn. \n\n\n\nBAKGRUND\n\nAction Against Hunger (AAH) grundades i Paris, Frankrike, 1979 f\u00f6r att bland annat ge st\u00f6d till afghanska flyktingar i Pakistan samt matos\u00e4kra hush\u00e5ll i Uganda. AAH har sedan dess vuxit kontinuerligt, och utg\u00f6r i dag en av de st\u00f6rsta humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rerna inom sitt huvudmandat; det vill s\u00e4ga, nutrition och mats\u00e4kerhet. Action Against Hunger gick tidigare under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF), men valde att byta namn f\u00f6r att s\u00e4tta en mer internationell pr\u00e4gel p\u00e5 organisationen.\n\nUnder 1990-talet utvecklade AAH ett internationellt n\u00e4tverk, vars styrelse i dag best\u00e5r av medlemmarna AAH Frankrike (Sidas avtalspartner), AAH Indien, AAH Kanada, AAH Spanien, AAH Storbritannien och AAH USA. AAH:s internationella n\u00e4tverk delar en strategisk plan, och medlemmarna har gemensamt framtagit en rad principer, som till exempel neutralitet, transparens och icke-diskriminering, vilka de alla lyder under. Tillsammans har de ocks\u00e5 utarbetat ett gemensamt f\u00f6rh\u00e5llningss\u00e4tt till bland annat anti-korruptionsfr\u00e5gor. P\u00e5 medlemsniv\u00e5 har detta \u00f6versatts till separata anti-korruptionspolicys samt uppf\u00f6randekoder (code of conducts), som tillsammans med sina annex fastst\u00e4ller n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarnas nolltolerans mot sexuella \u00f6vergrepp och maktmissbruk. Ansvar och samording av AAH:s operativa verksamhet p\u00e5 landniv\u00e5 har uppdelats mellan de tre medlemmarna AAH Frankrike, AAH Spanien och AAH USA: \n\nAAH FRANKRIKE (Sidas avtalspartner)\nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Centralafrikanska Republiken, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Djibouti, Elfenbenskusten, Etiopien, Indien, Irak, Jemen, Jordanien, Kamerun, Liberia, Madagaskar, Myanmar, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Tchad, Ukraina, Zimbabwe. \n\nAAH SPANIEN\nBolivia, Colombia, Egypten, Guinea, Libanon, Malawi, Mali, Mauretanien, Niger, Palestina, Peru, Senegal, Sudan, Syrien, S\u00f6dra Kaukasus, Turkiet.  \n\nAAH USA\nCambodia, Haiti, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Sydsudan, Tanzania, Uganda. \n\nDe olika n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarna \u00e4r separata juridiska personer, vilket inneb\u00e4r att Sidas medel per definition vidaref\u00f6rmedlas i insatser som implementeras av n\u00e5got av AAH Spaniens och AAH USA:s landkontor. F\u00f6r 2018 inneb\u00e4r det, per den initiala allokeringen, att 57,3 % av Sidas st\u00f6d stannar inom AAH Frankrike, samtidigt som 17,1 % vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till AAH Spanien och 24,1 % till AAH USA. Resterande 1,5 % av 2018 \u00e5rs intiala st\u00f6d vidaref\u00f6rmedlas till AAH Kanada f\u00f6r implementering av metodst\u00f6det SMART. \n\n\n\nVERKSAMHET OCH MERV\u00c4RDE \n\nAAH:s vision \u00e4r en v\u00e4rld fri fr\u00e5n hunger, d\u00e4r s\u00e5v\u00e4l barn som vuxna har tillr\u00e4ckligt med mat och vatten, samt andra n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndiga resurser, f\u00f6r att uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5lla ett v\u00e4rdigt liv. Organisationens huvudmandat ligger inom livr\u00e4ddande insatser som syftar till att utrota f\u00f6rekomsten av hunger genom att f\u00f6rebygga, uppt\u00e4cka och behandla undern\u00e4ring, samt att bem\u00f6ta de underliggande orsakerna till hunger.  \n\nAAH bed\u00f6ms av Sida ha en viktig expertis och kompetens inom den humanit\u00e4ra verksamheten att arbeta med fr\u00e5gor kring nutrition och sektorer i dess n\u00e4ra anslutning s\u00e5som livsmedelsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten och sanitet samt h\u00e4lsa. AAH arbetar med de mest utsatta grupperna i m\u00e5nga av de stora humanit\u00e4ra kriserna. Jemen, Syrien och Sydsudan kan n\u00e4mnas som exempel, d\u00e4r AAH bland annat bist\u00e5r kritiskt undern\u00e4rda barn med n\u00e4ringstillskott. Genom st\u00f6d till AAH bidrar Sida ocks\u00e5 till att skapa f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar f\u00f6r mer h\u00e5llbara resultat inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Humanit\u00e4ra hj\u00e4lpinsatser kompletteras ofta med aktiviteter, som exempelvis utbildningstillf\u00e4llen inom sanitet och nutrition, vilka syftar till att st\u00e4rka utsatta m\u00e4nniskors motst\u00e5ndskraft. Sida har goda erfarenheter av AAH:s f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att snabbt svara p\u00e5 behov till f\u00f6ljd av pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt eskalerande kriser.\n\nAAH:s merv\u00e4rde som humanit\u00e4r partnerorganisation till Sida ligger i organisationens huvudmandat inom omr\u00e5det f\u00f6r nutrition, vilket kan p\u00e5visas genom att AAH: \n\nA.\tHar etablerad n\u00e4rvaro i majoriteten av v\u00e4rldens humanit\u00e4ra kriser. Med tre regionala kontor, 50 landkontor och totalt 8 000 medarbetare har AAH f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna, samt kapaciteten, att bist\u00e5 m\u00e4nniskor som \u00e4r i behov av st\u00f6d. \n\nB.\tTack vare sin etablerade n\u00e4rvaro, snabbt kan n\u00e5 ut till m\u00e4nniskor vid pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra kriser. AAH har, genom redan anst\u00e4lld personal, m\u00f6jlighet att vid humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer snabbt uts\u00e4nda personal, med gedigen erfarenhet av liknande krissituationer, som st\u00f6d till ber\u00f6rda landkontor. AAH:s snabba responskapacitet kunde bland annat ses i insatser som svarade upp mot humanit\u00e4ra behov kopplade till evakueringen av Mosul, Irak, 2017 samt vid den hastigt eskalerande flyktingstr\u00f6mmen fr\u00e5n Norra Rakhine, Myanmar, till Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, under slutet av 2017. \n\nC.\tVid implementeringen av insatser ofta anv\u00e4nder sig av en integrerad ansats, d\u00e4r undern\u00e4ringsproblematiken per kontext analyseras grundligt f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla en effektiv humanit\u00e4r respons. Insatser som syftar till att minska f\u00f6rekomsten av undern\u00e4ring, integrerar ofta, ut\u00f6ver medicinsk behandling med n\u00e4ringstillskott, komponenter inom livsmedelf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten, sanitet och h\u00e4lsa samt psykosocialt st\u00f6d. P\u00e5 s\u00e5 vis kan mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga och h\u00e5llbara l\u00f6sningar n\u00e5s. \n\nAAH:s n\u00e4tverksmedlemmar \u00e4r i regel direktimplementerande. Samtidigt har de f\u00f6r avsikt att, inom ramen f\u00f6r Grand Bargains lokaliseringsagenda, senast 2020 implementera 20 % av sina insatser genom lokala partnerorganisationer. AAH \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 en viktig partnerorganisation till FN, d\u00e4r AAH implementerar insatser med finansiellt och materiellt st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n bland annat UNICEF. \n\nSida \u00e4r f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande, fr\u00e5nsett FN och EU, AAH:s tredje st\u00f6rsta givare, efter USA och Storbritannien.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia.

V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r.

F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur.

AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker.

Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia.

Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning.

Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur.

AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker.

Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation.

Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r.

F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur.

AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker.

Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare.

These institutions face a huge challenge in their efforts to plan and effectively implement a comprehensive course of action at federal and state levels. This seriously hinders the country\u2019s ability to effectively plan and appropriately position for addressing the underlying root causes of water insecurity, environmental degradation, the recurrent disasters as well as the emerging threats due to climate change impacts.The intervention envisages to provide strategic directions and priority actions considering the evolving institutional context and emerging issues to promote resilience and adaptaive capacity.",

The programme is a follow-up phase of the \"IMS-Fojo Somalia Programme 2014-2018\" which amounted to a total figure of 57 MSEK.\n\nIn order to avoid an activity gap between the first and second phase, IMS/Fojo decided to start implementing the programme from 1st of January 2019 with temporary funding from IMS headquarter. This was done with the aspiration of Swedish funding for the second phase coming through during spring 2019. The Embassy will hence fund the activities retroactively, starting from 1st of January 2019. \n\nSweden is currently the only donor.",

        "description": "Somalia is one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with nearly 7 out of 10 people living in poverty. The poorest are widespread particularly among populations living in e.g. rural areas and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements. The humanitarian crisis in Somalia has for decades been one of the most complex and protracted emergencies in the world with climate-induced hazards (recurrent droughts and flashfloods), locust plagues and ongoing conflict. The country continues to be fragile with a population which frequently faces the predicament of too frequent shocks that do not allow ample time for recovery from local coping mechanisms.  \n\nClimatic changes which are likely to increase in both frequency and severity strongly impact on-going conflict dynamics, which in turn, significantly affect the livelihood of already vulnerable communities, especially through the effects on migration, forced displacement and loss of income generating resources/assets. The absence of livelihood options and the increase in poverty contribute to grievances, conflicts and susceptibility to shocks. The accumulation of household debt is a key vulnerability for those Somalis whose livelihoods are negatively impacted by repeated extreme patterns of climate shocks and intermittent conflict. Grievances that are linked to group affiliation are particularly serious risk factors as they affect conflicts on multiple severity levels.\n\nThe main objective of this contribution is to construct and contribute to the establishing a NEOC which will be the national hub for all emergency management planning and response, and the host the Federal Government (FG) level strategic response during a disaster situation in coordination and collaboration of the Federal Member States.",

        "description": "NRC is Norway\u2019s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida's Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC's capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida's humanitarian unit's annual budget appropriation which is substantial.\nThe objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: \"To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.\" It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.\nNRC\u2019s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.\u00a0Sida's Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC's method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).\nMore specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.\nAs an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:\u00a026% for Shelter and settlements,\u00a020% for\u00a0 Education,\u00a017% for Livelihoods and Food Security,\u00a014% for ICLA,\u00a09% for WASH,\u00a03% for Camp Management and\u00a011% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.\nThe good scores of NRC in ITAD's evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.\nDescribing NRC's activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC's work.\u00a0\nSHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC's expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in\u00a0protracted displacement situations.\nLIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life\u00a0and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten\u00a0livelihoods and individuals' and households' abilities to earn a living.\nICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one's rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC's lawyers.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to people to claim\u00a0and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative\u00a0dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity\u00a0documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge\u00a0around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face\u00a0particular obstacles in accessing their rights.\nEDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education\u00a0with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education\u00a0interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.\nCAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp\u00a0management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and\u00a0protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation\u00a0mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback\u00a0mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.\nWASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of infrastructre for\u00a0water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.\nSida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida's funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.\u00a0\nRRM Allocation 2021\nIncluded in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC's capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida's funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.\nMethod- and capacity-building projects\nIncluded in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp; advocacy forums at the national level.\n- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it\u00a0focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the \u2018Safe Programming\u2019 framework defining minimum commitments for NRC's operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in 'refugee-like' situations.\n- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to\u00a0ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC's ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.\n- Sida's support to NRC's CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.\n-\u00a0NRC\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida's humanitarian unit and Sida's unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at\u00a0generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida's Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.\n- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.\u00a0NRC's active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida's support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC's commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.\n- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida's humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.",

        "description": "NRC is Norway\u2019s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida's Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC's capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida's humanitarian unit's annual budget appropriation which is substantial.\nThe objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: \"To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.\" It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.\nNRC\u2019s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.\u00a0Sida's Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC's method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).\nMore specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.\nAs an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:\u00a026% for Shelter and settlements,\u00a020% for\u00a0 Education,\u00a017% for Livelihoods and Food Security,\u00a014% for ICLA,\u00a09% for WASH,\u00a03% for Camp Management and\u00a011% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.\nThe good scores of NRC in ITAD's evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.\nDescribing NRC's activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC's work.\u00a0\nSHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC's expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in\u00a0protracted displacement situations.\nLIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life\u00a0and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten\u00a0livelihoods and individuals' and households' abilities to earn a living.\nICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one's rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC's lawyers.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to people to claim\u00a0and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative\u00a0dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity\u00a0documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge\u00a0around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face\u00a0particular obstacles in accessing their rights.\nEDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects.

The objectives are in alignment with FAO\u2019s commitment to working in partnerships.\nIn humanitarian crises, FAO\u2019s main components are:\nTo help people to anticipate and prepare for crises; To respond fast to crises; To seek to reduce risks and address vulnerabilities.\nThe humanitarian operations are usually related to the 5th strategic objective which has the four following organizational outcomes (OO):\nOO1 - countries and regions have legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition;\nOO2 - countries and regions deliver regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food, and nutrition;\nOO3 - countries apply prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks for agriculture, food and nutrition;\nOO4 - countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition are prepared for, and manage effective responses.\nAt the next level in the FAO Strategic Framework, there are a number of outputs pertinent to humanitarian action, such as:\nOutput 4.1: Humanitarian action effectively protect lives and livelihoods of farmers, herders, Fishers, forest- and tree-dependent communities and marginal groups in times of crises.\nOutput 3.1: Strategies and related interventions improve the resilience of livelihoods systems at risk through prevention and mitigation efforts that minimize the potential impacts of disasters and crises on agriculture food and nutrition at national, subnational and community levels.\nOutput 2.2: Improved capacities of countries and communities to identify monitor and evaluate risks; conduct needs assessment and response analysis; and act on impending threats to agriculture, nutrition, food security and food safety (and related public health issues).\nOutput 3.3: Conflict-sensitive programmes on agriculture, food and nutrition reduce the risks of localized conflicts relating to access to grazing, forest and farming lands, fishing grounds, water, trees and other natural resources.\nAs Sida support FAO\u2019s operations through a variety of different projects in different contexts, this appraisal does not include an overarching results framework. In the annual follow up reading up to Sida\u2019s conclusion on performance all individual project reports will be analysed and assessed.",

        "description": "According to the project application the objective of the intervention is to promote high-level political dialogue processes as a means of contributing to improved peace and stability in Somalia. More specifically, to improve the political relationship between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and the Federal Member States (FMS); build the capacity of MoIFAR and FMS line Ministries in the implementation of the National Reconciliation Framework (NRF); and help resolve inter and intra-Federal Members States relations through dialogue. The Somalia National Reconciliation Framework/Plan will be used as a guiding document to holds all these elements together.\nThe project aims to continue building on and consolidating achievements made through Sweden\u2019s support to HD-facilitated work in Somalia to date. The project is based on three distinct but related dialogue streams or sub-objectives:\nPromote high-level dialogue between the FGS and FMS through the MoIFAR-led National Reconciliation Framework (NRF) implementation process that helps resolve political tensions between them and paves the way for consensus building on key issues including federalism, constitutional review, forthcoming election and security amongst other state building concerns. Facilitate capacity building and provision of technical advice by both local and international expertise to MoIFAR and FMS line ministries in the implementation of the NRF that informs and shapes the process while improving working relations between the FGS and FMS.

This project seeks to advance the objectives with the following activities:\nPromote high-level dialogue between the Federal Government of Somalia and the Federal Member States by: Continuing to work with senior representatives of MoIFAR at Federal and FMS levels as well as key advisors on reconciliation in the President/Prime Minister\u2019s office in reaching out to key high-level representatives to engage in the dialogue between the FGS and FMS; Working with MOIFAR using the NRF as an entry point in partnership with FBA and UN REFS to create an FGS-FMS inter-ministerial forum that will ultimately become the operational/implementation arm of the NRF process; Undertaking shuttle dialogue between key actors to develop strategies for getting buy-in and ownership of the top leadership at both the FGS and FMS level on the federal structure and other state building matters; Facilitating and convening dialogue between the FGS and FMS leadership in order to resolve conflict issues between them such as constitutional review, elections, federalism, security and agree on mechanisms to address any new arising matters; Providing technical advice and expertise in the dialogue processes as well as capacity building support for key stakeholders in thematic areas on economic, political and social issues such as resource and power-sharing, reconciliation and conflict resolution amongst others;\nExpected outcomes of objective 1:\nExpected outcomes of the 2021-2023 project: - Increased confidence amongst the parties\u2019, evidenced by their willingness and enthusiasm to participate in FGS-FMS dialogue;\n- Correspondence of action by FGS-FMS in relation to implementation of the Somalia National Reconciliation Framework and other national issues;

The political will to end AIDS is receding as governments deal with multiple challenges including nationalism, populism, conflict and instability. These challenges contribute to increasingly polarised societies. However, globally there are still 38 million people living with HIV and in 2019 there were 1.7 million new infections.\n\nKey population groups (such as LGBTQI+ people, sex workers, people who use drugs) and their partners, and adolescent girls and young women are most affected by HIV, and account for the majority of new infections. Globally, the total number of new HIV infections has hardly declined for several years, stagnant at 1.7 million since 2018. This is far above the UNAIDS target of 500,000 per year by 2020 and reflects a worsening picture.\n\nIn 2019, for the first time, key population groups and their partners accounted for the majority (62%) of all new infections worldwide. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa, regions where the epidemic is expanding, key population groups accounted for almost all new infections.",

        "description": "1. Early married/adolescent mothers/ adolescent girls who have dropped out: Low to no expectation that these girls will enroll or re-enroll in school. Girls themselves are reluctant to enroll/re-enroll they are embarrassed to enter school in a class with younger children. At mid line, 81% of caregivers stated age as an important deciding factor as to whether a child should attend school. Intensive accelerated learning classes will be key to enabling these girls to increase their learning level and to engage/re-engage with school amongst girls their own age. Nuanced messaging through BCC campaigns will raise the community support for girls of all ages to prioritize schooling. 2. Disabled girls: Low to no expectation that these girls will enrol in school. For those who are enrolled they are not expected to achieve at the same level as their peers. The teacher training module will be developed focusing on basic approaches to inclusive education, enabling teachers to better engage with disabled children in the classroom. Additionally, disabled girls will be targeted for bursary support. 3. IDPs, refugees, returnees Girls may have fled a conflict situation; violence and upheaval may have a negative impact on psychosocial wellbeing. Due to limited mobility, girls miss school and fall behind. These factors can lead to a general expectation, of the girl and her parents, that girls will not progress and succeed in school. Girls in these groups who are extremely poor will be identified for bursary support ensuring economic barriers do not prevent attendance. Additionally, psycho social support from trained teacher mentors will aid an increase in girls\u2019 well being. 4. Orphans, minorities and other girls from poor households Girls are often expected to leave school early, if they enrol at all, to look after siblings and contribute to family income, with school-going costs understandably a lower priority. Bursary support will help enable girls from poor households to attend school, despite the economic challenges they face. 5.Children of lower learning ability/demonstrating low performance in the classroom The percentage of caregivers stating that a child\u2019s ability should be an important factor determining whether a child should attend school reduced from 88% to 43%. Specifically designed messages promoted through BCC activities will increase community support for children of all abilities to attend school. Remedial classes will help those children keep up with the learning levels of their peers.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three out\nputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Local health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions ability to provide q\nuality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer t\nhan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also imp\nlements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

Zu diesem Zweck soll ein Insider-Netzwerk von engagierten Personen aus der Zivilgesellschaft gegr\u00fcndet und bef\u00e4higt werden, Mediation, Dialog und andere friedensrelevante Arbeiten vor Ort durchzuf\u00fchren. Zudem werden Workshops mit Akteuren der regionalen Verwaltung abgehalten, um ihr Bewusstsein f\u00fcr Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Frieden und Konflikten sowie Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf Konflikte zu sch\u00e4rfen und ihre F\u00e4higkeit zur Reaktion auf Konflikte auszubauen. Weiterhin werden in verschiedenen Distrikten Galmudugs gro\u00dfe Versammlungen im Rahmen des Gemeindedialogs organisiert, auf denen die Gemeindemitglieder lokale Konflikte und andere einschl\u00e4gige Fragen er\u00f6rtern und gemeinsam L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr diese Konflikte entwickeln k\u00f6nnen. Es wird 1-2 Mal im Monat ein regionales Radioprogramm produziert, in dem Friedens- und Konfliktthemen in verschiedenen Formaten diskutiert werden und an dem Zuh\u00f6rer aktiv teilnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Schlie\u00dflich werden die Anerkennung der Klimakrise und ihrer Auswirkungen auf Konflikt und Frieden sowie die Unterst\u00fctzung bei der Entwicklung von Ideen, wie die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels angegangen/reduziert werden k\u00f6nnen, in alle Projektaktivit\u00e4ten einbezogen.",

In order to effectively improve the capacity of individuals and organisations, we are working to deliver on three aims: I. Increasing humanitarian access to conflict areas by training the negotiation skills of humanitarian aid workers and mediators; II.

Older girls are likely to be already married. (2) Girls who have never enrolled in school, extremely vulnerable to early marriage or already adolescent wives and mothers. Most are involved in casual work and have limited time and interest to pursue regular education options. , the project will work with the government, communities and education providers to offer three tailored pathways for girls to access quality education over a period of 4 years: - An 11-month alternative basic education (ABE) course will enable young adolescents (girls and boys) who dropped out or have never been to school to reach a Grade 4 level, become fluent readers and fully numerate, and acquire basic life skills (financial literacy, leadership skills, communication and negotiation).",

It investigates security perceptions and practices of IDPs in four cities of Somalia (including Puntland) and Somaliland and thereby focus on the capacities that vulnerable populations develop to cope with the effects of violence and displacement and to mitigate their vulnerability. Grounded in the everyday (Lefebvre, 1971 2016, De Certeau, 1984; Felski, 1999) and bridging urban and security studies, the project foregrounds people's own understandings of security, which risks and threats they identify, however narrow or broadly defined, and how these risks impede on their daily life (Crawford   Hutchinson 2015). In particular, the research asks: What does security mean and on which security arrangements do urban IDPs rely in the everyday? How do social, political, economic and environmental factors shape dynamics of everyday security? What continuities and change characterize security arrangements and everyday security in the course of migration to the city? With photo-voice, the project additionally proposes a methodology that gives 'voice' to people who are usually overheard or silenced, without however relying solely on their verbal capacities.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve the living conditions and\nlivelihood opportunities of displaced communities in Hargeisa through the\nprovision of durable shelter with secure land tenure, settlement\ninfrastructure, basic services, and skills training.A long-term, unresolved issue for the politically stabilized and\nsteadily growing city of Hargeisa\nis the large number of IDP families residing on former government land and in\npublic buildings. The local government has been trying to address this problem\nby identifying land for resettlement, but lacks the financial and technical\ncapacity to address the pressing housing situation and to find lasting\nsolutions. UN-HABITAT, with previous funding from the Government of Japan, has\nassisted the municipality by providing low-cost housing, improved services, skills\ntraining and livelihood opportunities to returnees and IDPs at the Ayaha-II\nsettlement area, on the southern fringe of Hargeisa.\n\nThe interventions carried out under this project respond to the\ncontinuous need to improve living standards and provide durable solutions for\nreintegration and resettlement of displaced communities in Hargeisa. In\nparticular, the project aims to reduce tensions between IDPs and host\ncommunities and incorporates issues of protection, and spatial and\nsocio-economic integration through permanent resettlement and improvement of\nlivelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable groups (women and youth).\n\nIn particular, the proposed project will target the resettlement and\nprovision of durable shelter for 350 returnee   IDP families in Hargeisa\noriginating from congested urban IDP settlements like the \u201cState House Area\u201d, a\nlarge piece of former government land in the central part of the city, which is\noccupied by an estimated number of 3,000 people. The location of the project activities\nwill be the new AYAHA-III settlement site (neighbouring the Ayaha-II area,\nwhich was the target of previous UN-HABITAT shelter activities). The site was\nformally approved for permanent re-settlement of IDPs by the Municipality already\nin 2010 and the re-settlement process has already begun in late 2011. The\nbeneficiary selection for permanent shelter under this project will undergo a\nlocally driven process to assure a fair selection.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve access to safe and affordable water and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable households in urban and peri-urban areas of Hargeisa city, through expanded supply of drinking water from sustainable water sources, and associated creation of employment opportunities.\nThe project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). \nThe specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: \ni. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; \nii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and \niii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.\nThe overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. \nAs requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. \nWhile the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:\nii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield\niii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. \niv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)\n\n\n\n\n[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project \u201cRehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System\u201d (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)",

Specifically, UN-Habitat is\nmandated:\n\nTo advance the agenda on place-making and\n     public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and international\n     approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\n     UN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces\n     and the quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange,\n     cooperation and research between partners working in this fieldTo develop a policy approach on the role\n     that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of our rapidly urbanizing\n     world, to disseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a\n     plan for ensuring its application internationally;To assist in coordinating UN-Habitat partners in\ndisseminating knowledge to existing sustainable urban development processes at\nall government levels.Globally,\nthe growing attention to\npublic space informed the 23rd Session of the Governing Council of\nThe United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in 2011, where\nmember states mandated UN-Habitat to consolidate agency-wide work on public\nspace, to develop and promote public space policy, coordination, disseminate\nknowledge and directly assist cities in public space initiatives.[1]\n\n\nAgainst this\nbackdrop, UN-Habitat established in 2012, a Global Programme on Public Space\nnow working in 30 cities. The world secretariat of the United Cities and Local\nGovernments (UCLG) has created a Strategic Planning Committee chaired by the\ncities of Porto Alegre and Durban with a strategic focus on global advocacy,\nestablishing regional networks of cities working on public space, supporting\nlearning exchanges, tool development and documenting good practices in\npartnership with UN-Habitat. The Italian Institute of Urbanism (INU) has been\ninstrumental in developing the Charter on Public Space as well as hosting the\npublic space biennale.\n\nAnother great\nmilestone which has been achieved is the adoption of the 2016-2030 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals which adopted a Goal 11 \u2018Build cities and human settlements\ninclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\u2019 One of the proposed targets set\nout is \u201cby 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible,\ngreen and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and\npersons with disabilities\u201d.\n\nThe adoption of\nthe SDG 11.7 by the General Assembly in September 2015, constituted the most\nsignificant attention ever to public space in the global policy arena. However, continued support for SDG 11,\nand in particular public space Target 11.7, will be even more important to\nensure adequate means of implementation and a sound monitoring framework that\nwill be necessary to catalyse action on public space as a contribution to\nsustainable cities and human settlements. This will require that cities invest\nin public space and in the spirit of the new urban agenda cities and local\ngovernments should take an integrated, trans-disciplinary approach by working\nin partnership with a range of stakeholders and organizations, including civil\nsociety, academia and the private sector to ensure inclusive, safe and\naccessible public spaces for all.\n\nIn 2013-15, the Future of\nPlaces (FoP) initiative significantly contributed to raising awareness around\nthe public space agenda on a global level. The FoP is a multi-stakeholder\ninitiative which was established by Ax:son Johnson Foundation, UN-Habitat and\nProject for Public Spaces (PPS) bringing together a large and diverse network\nof stakeholders around the issues of public space through a series of annual\nconferences (2013 in Stockholm, 2014 in Buenos Aires and 2015 in Stockholm\nagain). The Future of Places gathered leading global thinkers, academia,\ndecision-makers, practitioners, other UN Agencies, media, communities and\nprivate sector that subscribe to the transformative power that good quality\npublic spaces can have in a city. All together the network represents about\n1,500 individuals from 700 organisations, from 275 cities, across 100 countries. The success of this initiative has shown the\ncommitment of a wide range of actors with a stake in public space, as well as\nhighlighted the global importance of this theme. In a short time it has created\na global movement for public space (10.000 followers on twitter) contributing\nactively to highlighting its benefits and putting it on the global development\nagenda.UN-Habitat has worked in\nthe area of public space for over 15 years. However, at the 23rd Governing\nCouncil of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States asked UN-Habitat to\nplace a larger focus on public space and how it can contribute to sustainable\nurban development. Specifically, UN-Habitat is mandated: \n\n\n\na) To advance the agenda on\nplace-making and public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and\ninternational approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\nUN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces and\nthe quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange, cooperation\nand research between partners working in this field; \n\n\n\nb) To develop a policy\napproach on the role that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of\nour rapidly urbanizing world, to\ndisseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a plan for\nensuring its application internationally;\n\nc) To assist in coordinating\nUN-Habitat partners in disseminating knowledge to existing sustainable\nurban development processes at all\ngovernment levels.\n\nThe project is\nalso aligned with the UN-Habitat Strategic Plan 2014-2019 and specifically to Sub-programme\n2: urban planning and design and expected\naccomplishment 2: integrated and\nparticipatory urban plans and public space for compact, inclusive and\nconnected cities.\n\nFor example, the project links with the\nfollowing UN-Habitat interventions:\n\n\u00b7\nUrban\nBasic Services: Sustainable Urban Transport in East African Cities (SUSTRAN)\nProgramme\n\n\u00b7\nParticipatory\nSlum Upgrading Programme (PSUP) \n\n\u00b7\nMunicipal\nSpatial Support Programme (MuSPP)\n\n\u00b7\nThe\nSafer Cities Programme\n\nUN\nHabitat is also a knowledge leader in the public space arena, developing tools\nand guidelines as well as contributing to global thinking through the Habitat\nIII issue papers, policy units, amongst others. Moreover, UN-Habitat has commenced several partnerships on the global\nbut also on the regional level focusing on issues related to public space. Therefore, UN-Habitat is perfectly\nplaced to take advantage of the opportunities presented by SDG11.7 on public\nspace and continue working on public space for the next four years.",

        "title": "Youth Political Empowerment: Enabling Somali Young Women And Men To Meaningfully Engage In Governance, Peacebuilding And Reconciliation Efforts",
        "description": "In light of the context and gap\nanalysis, the proposed intervention seeks the support of the UN Peacebuilding\nFund to increase the inclusion of young men and women in state and\npeacebuilding processes in Somalia. More specifically, since Somalia is in the process\nof reestablishing legitimate State institutions and systems of governance at\nthe Federal Member State and District level, this intervention seeks to\ncapitalize on this in order to ensure these structures are including young men\nand women and take their priorities into account. With the passing of the Local\nGovernment Laws in South West and Jubbaland States in July 2017, both states\nhave launched their respective District Council formation processes. It is\nvital that these governance bodies have youth representation and address the\nneeds of young Somali men and women for these new institutions to be\nrepresentative and perceived as legitimate by their constituents. While other\ndonor funds are supporting stabilization and peacebuilding efforts at the community\nlevel, as well as the development of local government institutions and systems,\nthere is currently no intervention specifically promoting the inclusion of\nyoung men in women in state and peacebuilding processes in South West State and\nJubbaland. An investment of the Peacebuilding Fund to support such an\ninitiative is anticipated to have a dual catalytic effect by changing the\nattidudes of decision makers and their constituences in Kismayo, Baidoa and\nDollow in favor of youth inclusion and by improving the representativity of\ndistrict and state level governance structures. This expected outcome will have\na substantial impact of intergenerational relations, enabling young men and\nwomen to become key agents of change in the peace and statebuilding processes\nof Jubbaland and South West States. This proposal directly supports the\noutcomes of the current Peacebuilding Priority Plan for Somalia (2016-19) which\naims to strengthen the demand for and offer of good governance \u2013 rebuilding the\nsocial contract between Somali citizens and the Somali State. The proposed\nintervention therefore also directly contributes to the implementation of the\nFederal Government of Somalia\u2019s Wadajir Framework for Local Governance and to\nits Stabilization Strategy. The Youth\nPolitical Empowerment Programme\naims to provide young people and youth-led organisations, particularly young\nwomen\u2019s organisations, in Baidoa, Dollow and Kismayo with the tools and\nopportunities to meaningfully engage in decision-making, including the\nconstitutional review process as well as state-building and reconciliation\nefforts at the district level. The programme supports\nthe implementation of UNSC Resolution\n2250 (2015), which recognises the important and positive contribution of\nyouth to the promotion and maintenance of peace and security. The proposed\nintervention will enable marginalized youth in Somalia to engage in\nstate and peacebuilding efforts at the local and federal levels. This directly\nsupports the implementation of the UN Youth Strategy Principles which has\nidentified the political participation, empowerment, leadership,\nprotection of youth human rights, inter-generational collaboration as\npriorities. The programme also supports the ongoing efforts\nto develop a National Youth Policy for Somalia. The proposed intervention is\nalso aligned with the Federal Government of Somalia\u2019s National Development Plan\nwhich mainstreams youth as a cross-cutting issue throughout the nations\npriorities in order to contribute towards stability, economic prosperity and\nnational cohesion. The difficult security and\npolitical context in Somlia, calls for innovative ways to reach-out, engage,\nand mobilize youth.Therefore, the programme will facilitate the use of\ninnovative communication platforms including social media (Facebook, Twitter,\netc), radio podcasts, and web TV, to reach out to youth creating a channel for\nyoung women and men to express their visions for the future of Somalia. By\namplifying young people\u2019s voices, the programme will promote the exchange of ideas\namong peers and communities at large, challenging negative perceptions and\nfostering an intergenerational dialogue and trust. In view of the specific\nneeds of young women identified above, the programme will adopt a gender\nresponsive approach, mainstreaming gender issues in all activities and ensuring\nequal access to benefits for both women and men of the different age groups.\nThe programme will particularly ensure the participation of young women, as\nthey traditionally suffer double discrimination (age and gender). Based on a\nrealistic assessment of the Somali context and the challenges faced by Somali\nwomen, all capacity building workshops and councils will aim to have at least\n40% young women beneficiaries. After assessing the needs of young women\u2019s organizations,\nthe programme decided to employ a gender mixed approach to the different\ninitiatives, bringing young women and men together, enabling a collaborative\napproach, while sensitizing young men in the process.The programme will also provide\ntraining and strengthen the institutional capacity of the local administrations\nin Baidoa, Dollow and Kismayo to respond to the needs of young women and men.\nBy employing an area based approach to improve coordination amongst all levels\nof government. The programme provides a catalytic\nopportunity to build on recent peace and state-building gains and builds on\nrecommendations from the Security Council Resolution 2250 on youth, peace and\nsecurity and the National Youth Conference held in 2015, which identified the\nneed for dialogue platforms at the local and regional levels.The programme proposal was\ndeveloped in close consultation with Y-Peer Network, and other local youth\norganisations in the target areas. Prior to implementation, further\nmobilization of young women and youth organizations will take place. In August\n2017, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports employed their national radio\nprogramme \u201cAsk Your Friend\u201d to hold consultations with young women and men.\nOver 450 young people engaged through radio call-ins and emails. The findings\nfrom the radio survey highlighted that 55% of respondents emphasized there is a\ndire need for youth to meaningfully engage in peacebuilding. They also raised\nthe need for more efforts to minimize or respond to clan disputes, tackle\nillegal migration and prevent violent extremism. Moreover, 30% of the\nrespondents, underscored that youth-led community action should be prioritized\nwhile 15% of the respondents underscored the need for increased youth\nparticipation in political and governance decision-making processes.",

        "description": "UNDP and UN-Habitat are cooperating in the UN Joint Programme for Youth Employment, which \u2013 since its inception in October 2015 - has provided training and work opportunities to over 6,000 young women and men. This Action will build upon the successful model created, greatly contributing to and enhancing realistic livelihood opportunities for youth, with a strengthened focus on IDPs and returnees. This Action will significantly build on this work in the following ways:\u2022\tProviding youth in the targeted IDP communities with mentorship and entrepreneurship training;\u2022\tProviding safe spaces for IDP youth to learn and acquire the necessary skills to access the labour market for sectors that are immediately remunerative;\u2022\tEnabling IDPs to become more competitive in the lucrative sectors of the labour market.UNHCR has established a capacity building curriculum under the Protection Cluster focusing on protection and durable solutions for displaced populations, international humanitarian law, housing, land and property rights protection, including protection against forced evictions, as well as humanitarian negotiations. This Action will utilise the capacity building curriculum in the following ways:\u2022\tProviding eviction guidelines to authorities and law enforcement sectors explaining lawful evictions processes and their implementation;\u2022\tTraining of authorities on the protection of IDPs, durable solutions and protection of housing, land and property rights for IDPs and other vulnerable groups, notably against force evictions;\u2022\tConduct advocacy campaigns on IDP specific protection and durable solution-related challenges in the Mogadishu context.UNDP and UN-Habitat have been working on the Joint Programme for Local Governance (JPLG) since 2008. The Programme has facilitated strong, dynamic and organic links with government and non-state actors. UNDP and UN-Habitat\u2019s efforts in strengthening local governance will be replicated in this Action by:\u2022\tProviding capacity building training to the municipality which aims to create knowledge surrounding standards and systems necessary to support social protection programmes such as rental subsidy, low-cost housing, and relocation of IDPs;\u2022\tFormulating by-laws at the local municipal level.Potential Synergies(Please refer to the potential synergy table on the attached prodoc.)In September 2015, the Somalia Protection Cluster supported by UN-Habitat and UNHCR held the first ever Housing, Land and Property forum in Mogadishu bringing together Federal authorities, the municipality, UN and NGOs as well as donors to deliberate on more sustainable approaches to address forced evictions and support urban durable solutions. The outcomes of this forum and the relevant follow up processes also inform this proposal. Future Housing, Land and Property fora will further be used to support this Action.In December 2015, the DSRSG/RC/HC for Somalia launched the Somalia IDP Solutions Initiative advocated for by the Somalia Protection Cluster and supported by the three agencies participating in this joint action. This initiative was borne out of the need to urgently address the deteriorating situation of the IDPs and find durable solutions to protracted displacements. The Initiative seeks \u201cto complement still needed humanitarian assistance with development interventions to reverse the trend of protracted displacement and substantially reduce the number of IDPs in such displacement by facilitating and supporting durable solutions that bring them back into mainstream life and address underlying causes of their displacement and its protractedness.\u201d This initiative is led by the Federal Government of Somalia represented by H.E. Mohamed Arteh, Deputy Prime Minister, and the DSRSG/RC/HC. This action will actively and directly contribute towards the IDP Solutions Initiative",

If urbanization is the engine that propels the world towards prosperity in the 21st century then youth are the engineers. There are more people under the age of 25 today than ever, totaling over three billion or almost half of the total global population; 1.8 billion of that total are between the age of 12 and 24. These youth live, by and large, in cities and towns; the cities of the developing world account for over 90% of the world\u2019s urban growth and youth account for a large percentage of those inhabitants. It is estimated that as many as 60% of all urban dwellers will be under the age of 18 by 2030.",

        "title": "Achieving Local Solutions To Displacement Crises In Somalia: A Human Security Approach To Durable Solutions",
        "description": "Human\nmobility should be considered in conjunction with the spatial repercussions\nthat population movements have on the locations affected by displacement. Over\nthe course of more than two decades of conflict, access to land, security of\ntenure and more broadly settlement\nhave become central issues affecting Somalia\u2019s security and stability going\nforwards; influencing the country\u2019s trajectory towards recovery and development\nin future; and ultimately playing a key role in establishing the foundations\nfor human security for displaced populations, returnees, other mobile groups\nand their hosts. \n\n\n\nIssues\nrelated to land tenure in Somalia are inextricably linked to voluntary and\nforced migration. Land is central to many different economic, social, cultural,\nenvironmental and political goals, making tenure security vital for peace and\nstability. Yet, land becomes a conflict driver when forms of dispossession take\nplace, or when rights to land use, access and transferability are violated. Any\ndisruptive or forcefully imposed change in how groups and individuals connect\nwith their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia did -\nresult in forms of organised violence. Conflict, natural disasters or rapid\nsocial and economic transformations (e.g. state formation, industrialization\nand urbanisation) trigger migrations that separate populations from their\nbelongings, assets, livelihoods and the cultural landmarks they identify with.\nHaving in place fair mechanisms to protect formal and customary rights to\naccess, use and transferability of land and regulate land use and allocation is\nessential to prevent outbreaks of conflict and violence.\n\n\n\nRegarding movements\nand dispossessions produced by conflict and natural disasters, in Somalia the\nnumber of internally displaced has almost tripled over the past ten years. The\nurban dimension of internal displacement is evident and corroborated by the\ntrends in rural to urban migration which has, over the past ten years, averaged\nrates of 4.1-4.5%. The relevance of cities in strengthening security,\nresponding to large population influxes and consolidating peace dividends is\nunquestionable. Yet, city expansion in major urban centres in Somalia is\nlargely unplanned and unregulated and land is arbitrarily redistributed.\nIncreased commercial interests have triggered large-scale investments, as well\nas construction works for commercial and residential structures. However, the\ntrickle-down effect of this renewed commercial interest is extremely limited.\nVulnerable populations hardly ever are in the position to harness the benefits\nof this rapid transformation. Displaced persons, returnees urban dwellers and\nurban poor are caught in a negative feedback loop, whereby the lack of\nregulation, good governance and law enforcement, exacerbates insecure access to\nland, exposure to violent land disputes and forcible eviction, as well as\nexclusion from public service delivery. This vulnerability and marginalization\ncontributes to pervasive fragility and conflict, In sum, nascent formal\ninstitutions are unequipped to equitably re-establish tenure units, and\ncustomary rights are often arbitrary and not accessible to \u201cidentity-defined\u201d\nstrangers - this would be the case of returnees and migrants who cannot access,\ncontrol and transfer land customary rights on the same grounds as local\ncommunities.\n\n\n\nThe recent\nannouncement by the government of Kenya expressing intention to repatriate\nSomali refugees has raised the already prominent issue to a critical level in\nsome areas. In the absence of a well-established legislative framework and law\nenforcement procedures for land, context appropriate, consensus based, and\nequitable solutions to land remain key establishing foundations for sustainable\nrecovery and stability. Conversely, the failure to address land issues,\nsecurity of tenure and sustainable housing could result in instability,\nconflict and the destitution of affected groups. \n\n\n\nThe multidimensional\naspect of community driven responses to instability and conflict mitigation\nrelated to mobility and housing, land and property as well as urban planning\nrequires a multi-agency approach, through which each agency will capitalize on\nits own experience and expertise. The International Organization for Migration\n(IOM) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) have the\nexpertise and mandates to support these locally owned processes in addressing\nmobility/displacement and space/urban planning. IOM, as the leading agency on\nmobility and migration, will utilize its experience in supporting community\ndriven approaches to respond to drivers of displacement and mitigate disputes\nrelated to mobility and movements, while UN-HABITAT, as the leading agency for\nurban planning and addressing issues related to space, including land, will\nemploy its expertise in supporting locally driven approaches to promote\nparticipatory urban planning, participatory settlement upgrading, resolve land disputes and map conflicts and\ndispute resolution mechanisms related to housing, land and property.\n\n\n\nGiven the scale of\nSomalia\u2019s population movements summarized above, geographic targeting through a\nfirst phase of support needs to be carefully considered and the following\ncriteria are used to prioritize targeting for this project. Firstly, areas\nimpacted by the return of Somalis from Dadaab refugee camp are prioritized for\nthis intervention. Whilst the number of IDPs by far exceeds the number of those\nreturning from Dadaab, the former are living in protracted situations of\ndisplacement and the latter will return over a short space of time. This\njustification is therefore based on the time critical impact that returns will\nhave in existing fragile contexts and the accompanying need to provide support\nat social, infrastructural and legislative levels. The second criterion is to\ntarget those areas highly impacted by internal displacement particularly those\nnot currently covered by existing interventions. When combined with the first\ntargeting, of areas being impacted by return, the following areas become an\nobvious priority. \n\n\n\n\n \n  \n  Location\n  \n  \n  Estimated IDP population\n  \n  \n  Estimated No. of returns based on intention\n  surveys[1]\n  \n  \n  Returnees from Dadaab to date\n  \n \n \n  \n  Kismayo\n  \n  \n  57,240[2] \n  \n  \n  39,723\n  \n  \n  4,873\n  \n \n \n  \n  Afmadow\n  \n  \n  54,984[3]\n  \n  \n  \n  2,085\n  \n  \n  1,347\n  \n \n \n  \n  Garbaharey\n  \n  \n  3,325\n  \n  \n  58\n  \n  \n  133\n  \n \n \n  \n  Baardheere\n  \n  \n  18,000\n  \n  \n  1,600\n  \n  \n  2,005\n  \n \n \n  \n  Bu\u2019ale\n  \n  \n  12,000\n  \n  \n  3,966\n  \n  \n  1,536\n  \n \n \n  \n  Sakow\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  2,181\n  \n  \n  2,004\n  \n \n \n  \n  Jamame\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  193\n  \n  \n  764\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nFor the funding from\nthe Human Security Trust Fund, the interventions will focus on Kismayo and\nAfmadow, while additional co-funding from other sources (Peacebuilding Fund,\netc.) will focus on other locations within Jubaland. Members of the joint\nprogramme currently have either an existing operational footprint or will\nexpand to these locations in the coming months which also supports the\nfeasibility of supporting interventions there.\nFurthermore, all of the above referenced locations have been identified as\npriority by the Federal Government Ministry of Interior and are therefore in\nline with government\u2019s current focus for the types of interventions proposed.",

Le programme s\u2019articule autour des trois composantes suivantes : 1) appui aux infrastructures d\u2019alimentation en eau et d\u2019assainissement afin de renforcer la r\u00e9silience ; 2) renforcement des capacit\u00e9s ; et 3) gestion du programme.",

Le projet r\u00e9pond aux besoins urgents en mati\u00e8re de fourniture de services d\u2019eau et d\u2019assainissement dans les zones rurales et p\u00e9riurbaines touch\u00e9es par des s\u00e9cheresses r\u00e9currentes et des maladies d\u2019origine hydrique comme la diarrh\u00e9e aqueuse aigu\u00eb et le chol\u00e9ra. En effet, l\u2019\u00e9tat de d\u00e9labrement des infrastructures d\u2019eau et d\u2019assainissement constitue un facteur majeur contribuant \u00e0 des flamb\u00e9es importantes de maladies d\u2019origine hydrique, en particulier la diarrh\u00e9e dont le taux d\u2019incidence en Somalie s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 21 %.

Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden bereits Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt. Zur Finanzierung des Vorhabens stellt das BMZ insgesamt 23,24 Mio. EUR aus FZ-Altmitteln und einer neuen bilateralen Zusage bereit. Angesichts der gro\u00dfen Bedarfe in den drei Projektst\u00e4dten erfolgte dar\u00fcber hinaus eine Vorratspr\u00fcfung in H\u00f6he von 50 Mio. EUR.",

Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt.",

Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment gives women the independence, confidence, and ability to transform their lives. There is a direct correlation between improvements in health, education, peace, and security and the eventual success of women entrepreneurs to catalyse change within their regions, clans, towns, and families.

        "description": "The 3rd phase of the Joint Programme on Local Governance (JPLG) will focus on creating an enabling environment for improved service delivery and greater stability, through improved legal, policy and system frameworks \u2013 building the knowledge of those working in and with local governments. Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

The additional funding supports the Somaliland Ministry of Health efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic health consequences\n for 3 months. To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three outputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Loc\nal health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increased capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Som\nali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developing strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child hea\nlth. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health outcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has b\neen evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide quality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the plann\ning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer than in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora expe\nrts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also implements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 un\ntil August 2020. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proj\nect's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinic?s personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

The caseworkers and monitors in the present proposal will act as a reference for the referral pathways aiming at connecting services in the communities. Before starting the implementation, HIWA will coordinate with Shelter, protection, WASH, and CCCM to ensure complementarity and reinforcement of the project approach. HIWA has a strong experience in child protection in emergency and in resilience context and has previously implemented child protection programs funded by UNICEF in Beletweyne and Buula Burte, through this experience HIWA has established linkages with community leaders, local authorities and camp leaders making access and acceptance easier in the target locations. HIWA will coordinate with the regional education cluster during the implementation of the project. Coordination with WASH cluster will be essential in implementing the project, HIWA will work closely with Wash partner who will carry out hygiene promotion in schools and also ensure the water sources in the schools are safe.\n\nOpportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration within and beyond the HIWA education and protection sectors will be sought. The collaboration will include emergency operations with cluster partners to ensure a comprehensive approach and view of education and child protection. HIWA will use the strength of its relationship with the regional education and protection clusters to share information and collaborate in service provision to avoid duplication of activities in the selected schools. Before implementation starts, HIWA will liaise with the regional coordination structure to identify schools that have not been targeted by other partners. HIWA will also closely work with Relief International and Qatar foundation on hygiene promotion and other WASH interventions. Referrals will be directed to them where WASH needs are identified in different schools.",

        "description": "Increased rainfall since the beginning of September in both Ethiopian highlands and within the catchments in Somalia has resulted in a sharp rise in the Shabelle and Juba rivers, leading to severe flooding in southern and central Somalia. According to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), the recent Shabelle river flooding displaced over 270,000 people, of whom 230,000 are in Beletweyne District. Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. According to the FAO-led Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the rains are projected to continue in the coming weeks and it is expected to end in early December. DRC proposes to undertake a life-saving and sustainable assistance to Flood- Displaced people in Beletweyne through provision of emergency shelter kits (ESK), non-food items (NFIs). DRC will target 2050 households (12,300 people) with ESK and NFIs. The standard emergency NFI package will include plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamp and Jerry cans. Where possible, DRC will give the NFIs through cash transfers or vouchers so that beneficiaries can decide based on their needs. DRC will also assist with a standard ESK that contains: Local available stick for vertical post (Philippian Tree) Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philippian Tree) or White wood (8cm x 4cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing or White wood (5cm x 2.5cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) at the base of roof truss or White wood (10cm x 2.5cm size each) Nails No. 5 (5 inch) Nails No. 6 (6 inch) Drum door with frame Hinges for door Local plastic sheet (size: 4m x 7m) and outer wall clothing Buul layer. This provides the most basic shelter which can offer protection from extreme weather. The ESK helps the displaced household to put up by a 4m x 4m shelter structure within the first few days of displacement. DRC is aware that the needs are huge and the available funding cannot cover everyone. DRC is also aware that families of affected persons are normally the first responders and therefore, some families may be better positioned to survive such disaster due to their own social networks. Therefore DRC will develop a selection criteria based on AGD as well as vulnerability to ensure that assistance goes to the ones who deserve it most. Female-headed households, families with many children and the aged (65+ year-olds) will be given priority. DRC will also ensure that, persons living with disabilities (PLDs) or families with such persons are also targeted with assistance.  Families considered extremely vulnerable, will be assisted by DRC to put up their shelter through cash paid after erection. DRC determines that this cash shall be 60 USD and targets 540 hhs out of 2050 hhs. DRC will undertake a post-distribution monitoring (PDM) study four (4) weeks after distribution to measure the effectiveness of distribution and also the satisfaction of the beneficiaries on the items distributed. This will help inform future programming in shelter, NFIs and CCCM programming. Specific to CCCM, DRC shall engage in installation of solar lights and in settlement maintenance including clearance of any solid waste and access roads. DRC will also, jointly with the camp/settlement committees undertake mapping of available services and establish a referral system. Through that, DRC will establish information boards at strategic points like social centers like water points and markets for people to have easy access to information. DRC will support community governance structures through trainings to ensure that camp/settlement committees can manage their daily issues in a structured manner. At sub-national level, DRC will ensure coordination of CCCM meetings happen and deliberations are reported.",

The nutrition cluster priority districts in Hiran region including Beletweyne due to critical levels of GAM rate at 19.6 and SAM of 4.1. The project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected populations. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project includes construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health, nutrition and WASH services through the support of static health facilities and mobile outreach to the flood affected populations in Hiran, particularly Beletweyne District. There will be 8 sites that will provide integrated health and nutrition services for flood affected communities, offering outpatient consultations, routine immunization, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTPs, TSFP, IYCF-E and referral to stabilization centers. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will also be provided. Special focus will be given to prevention of disease outbreak and malnutrition, improve early identification malnutrition by empowering mothers to use MUAC screening, access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThe WASH component in health and nutrition will also improve good hygiene practices, rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure, more equitable and better access to sustainable water points for drinking and handwashing with soap, and provision of basic sanitation services in these facilities. Hygiene and sanitation support and promotion will be provided in an integrated approach in the health and nutrition sites. There will also be outreach nutrition, hygiene and health promotion within the community and in schools. This will empower children to be agents of change for hygiene promotion.",

        "description": "Flood triggered displacement is on the rise in Middle Shebelle, with new areas engulfed by floods water during the wet season every day. The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

        "description": "The rains that have inundated parts of Somalia are expected to continue in November with moderate to heavy intensity, according to the FAO Managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM). Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

Also this project is working to rehabilitate WASH facilities damaged by the floods including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding. It will contribute to the reduction of emergency WASH gaps reported and works to improve the hygiene practices of the affected communities through kit distribution and awareness campaigns. \nThe project is for 6 months targeting a total beneficiary of 30,000 individuals living in Baldweyn. This reserve allocation will enable QC to scale up flood responses in Beledweyn and reach more beneficiaries in the coming months. \n1.\tThis Project will work to provide emergency water trucking through voucher to flood affected communities in Beledweyn. Currently, potential high-risk areas for the water trucking activities are areas where people are displaced to. A total of 2,500 households equivalent to 15,000 people will be supported  with water voucher for 3 months and each person will be provided 15 l/p/d (acceptable WASH cluster standards in Somalia), with total of 2,520 trucks.\nQC will also provide water to health/nutrition facilities and schools within the target communities. QC will competitively contract water vendors to supply households with agreed quantities over the specified period. Households provided with vouchers will access their allocation of water at the water distribution point on a daily basis. The community water monitors will register the collection of the water in a register book with the household representative and signing or thumb print as a record. All the supplied water will be chlorinated. In addition, a list of recommended boreholes will be mapped out for water trucking. This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

        "description": "The proposed six-month project aims to provide urgent lifesaving assistance to flood-affected communities in Beletweyne while mainstreaming protection and integrating sustainable, flood-resistant solutions. The WASH intervention will improve the health and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in flood-affected communities through increased access to safe water, use of latrines, hygiene promotion and increased adoption of safe hygiene practices. Cash programming, in the form of conditional transfers, vouchers, and cash for work (CfW), will form a core pillar of the proposed intervention. Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

        "description": "The Somalia NGO Consortium (SNC) was first established in 1999 as a network of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working together to improve international aid coordination and raise the presence and profile of NGO representation within the aid coordination structure for Somalia. Since inception, the Somalia NGO Consortium has grown as an effective network, actively supporting its members to promote dialogue, collaboration, learning experiences, information exchange and to advocate on issues of key concern. Currently, the Consortium is the primary NGO coordination and representation mechanism, with a membership of 93 national and international NGOs working in all parts of Somalia/Somaliland, around humanitarian, development, peace-building, health, education among other thematic areas.  Governed by a Steering Committee elected by the membership, the SNC provides a platform for information-sharing and representation to governments, UN agencies, donor groups and multilateral organisations at local, national and international levels. The Consortium has offices and representation in Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Garowe, Baidoa, Kismayo and plans to expand its reach to constituencies in the remaining federal states through extensive outreach work from the current offices. The SNC expects to reach 100 NGOs by end of 2019 which will increase membership needs. The SNC is currently co-funded through Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), OFDA (USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and membership subscription fees. Legal and contractual responsibilities associated with funding and contracting are held by host agencies, as SNC is not a legally constituted entity, but rather a network of its membership. During the relocation process in 2019, the SNC has gone through transitions on multiple levels including management and relocation form Nairobi to Mogadishu. Our costs and needs from our membership have significantly increased and significant positions are left unfilled including Advocacy Officer, Deputy Director and Grants amp Partnership Officer. SNC's annual budget for 2020 is estimated to be around $1,409,806 USD. Further information can be found below on budget secured and proposals submitted.",

        "description": "TThe NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO.\n\nIn response to and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed by 4 INGOs and 1 LNGOs), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support.\n\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor Assistants, NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 41,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions, injuries and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs. \n\nThe project budget leans heavily on HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "The overall goal of the project is to contribute to improvement of living conditions and access to basic services for displaced in persons by bolstering effectiveness of coordination mechanisms and community led governance structures in Luuq which is a CCCM under-served area. The envisaged actions will set the foundation for attaining durable solutions through strengthened community self-management. DRC will facilitate the analysis of needs and intervention gaps within IDP sites in Luuq, initiating advocacy for support to respond to identified needs and gaps, as well as protection concerns. DRC will also contribute to the administrating and documenting regular cluster meetings in collaboration with UNHCR. DRC will engage local authorities including governmental and community leadership to work towards durable solutions for displaced populations. \n\nThe project will engage implementing partners and relevant authorities on identified needs, gaps, and overlaps. Furthermore, DRC will advocate for and support the adoption of an area-based approach for service delivery in IDP sites. The project will conduct training of relevant government authorities in CCCM principles to enhance their understanding of humanitarian assistance through the CCCM model.\n\nDRC will take on responsibility for targeted IDP sites to undertake the following:\n- Map out existing governance structures and focal points at the targeted IDP sites. Where governance structures exist, their capacity will be built in camp management and other essential principles. Where these governance structures are absent, DRC will facilitate their establishment through the creation of Camp Management Committees (CMCs).\n- Monitor service delivery in the IDP sites through CCCM Mobile Teams to identify any service gaps and overlaps of interventions by implementing agencies.\n- Reinforce accountability to displaced populations through increasing communication and feedback on availability of services. This will be done through multiple approaches including construction and establishment of community centers for information hubs, and through awareness raising campaigns about site services. Furthermore, DRC will establish and strengthen complaint and feedback mechanisms (CFMs) in sites. For referrals, DRC will work with existing protection stakeholders on appropriate and principled referrals, with particular attention to protection concerns, and service delivery to persons with special needs.\n- Work to improve site safety and hygiene through a participatory approach, utilizing a cash-for-work modality to carry out site maintenance activities. This additionally links participating IDP residents to temporary income and encourages ownership of the site. Site safety audits and fire hazard training will also be conducted.\n\nBeneficiary description:\nThe proposed intervention supports multiple stakeholders through camp management activities at the targeted five IDP sites with the aim of increased coordination at the site level, for displaced populations in  Luuq, where the established governance structures will hold monthly coordination meetings at the site level to discuss gaps and needs of IDP residents so that these identified gaps and needs will be taken  to the relevant humanitarian partners who assist in filling those gaps at the targeted sites.\nAt the present time, based on discussions with relevant stakeholders, DRC has selected the following sites to support:\n1.Ban Munduli (Akaro) - 715 H\u2019H\n2.Buyle - 520 H\u2019H\n3.Luuq Hilaac - 355 H\u2019H\n4.Jazeera - Jadiid - 450 H\u2019H\n5.Luuq Waaberi - 460 H\u2019H",

The project intervention is timely significant to address and respond to the education cluster and drought response plan (June-December 2019) strategies: i) prioritize education support to children where they live and ii) education opportunity to children in place where they move to ensure they can continue their education. Education is critical during emergencies like drought. It protects children from risks and protection related concerns. School-aged children will be provided lifesaving education intervention to schools they are currently learning to prevent the risk of dropout as well as mitigate the protection risks. Equally, school-aged children who are displaced by the drought will be reached out to their places to ensure they have access to quality education and protection services in locations they moved to the proposed project will be targeting 4000 school aged children affected by the drought in 18 schools in Belethawa (4 schools), Bardhere (4 schools), Luuq (5 schools), Garbaharey (2 schools) and Burdhubo(3). The project will target 4000 school-aged drought affected children in Gedo (2,200 boys and 1,800 girls). Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies: As per the education minimum standard on teaching and learning materials, learners and teachers will be provided learning materials in accordance to set standards. Each grade 1-3 student will receive learning kit consisting of 7 books (6 single ruled and 1 single Squared100 sheets), 4 pencils, 4 rubbers and 2 sharpeners while students between Grade 4 and 8 will receive  7 books ((6 single ruled and 1 single Squared 100 sheets), 2 pens,2 rubbers , 1 sharpener and one student mathematics set. Bags will be given the girls provided for the sanitary kits to carry their sanitary materials to the schools to reduce their absence during menstrual period, emergency school feeding to promote retention of learners, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers, training of teachers and CECs on education and child protection, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. WASH Specific activities will include water trucking to the schools and construction of water storages (Barkets), the construction of gender segregated school latrines with hand-washing facilities.  As education is lifesaving, protection mainstreaming will be key and critical to ensure children have access to protective learning environment. HIRDA will conduct protection service mapping in the target schools. The members will be able to identify children with protection concern both at the school and community. They also, help in organising children led social mobilization campaign in the community. Also, organise structured recreational activities in the school4000 (1800 girls) learners will be provided with recreational materials as per the education cluster minimum standard. Children in the target locations will have access to structured recreational play in the schools. Through the recreational materials, children will have access to play and interact with other children. Children clubs will also be established in the target schools.\n\nHIRDA has been active education partner as well as nutrition and health. Based on its vast experienced field staff who benefited trainings offered by the education cluster and UNICEF, HIRDA will be directly implementing this project. The project will complement the ongoing alternative basic education, health and nutrition programmes funded by UNICEF. School-aged children will have access to nutrition screening exercise to identify children with acute malnutrition and treated. Equally, the health HIRDA team will prioritise the target schools to ensure children are dewormed and treated communicable diseases and illnesses.",

        "description": "The proposed project seeks to improve  immediate access to food and to protect and restore the livelihood-related food and income sources for the most vulnerable rural H.H living in rural  Baidoa villages in Bay region - Somalia. The project targets 1,350 households comprising of 8,247 boys, girls, women and Men. Project period will be 6 months. The primary target will be the most vulnerable families under the integrated food security classification (IPC) 3 and above that are currently living in  rural Baidoa villages. Target will be mainly villages of northern Baidoa namely Lawiiley (9km), Midow (12km) and Maaranka (15km) and small villages around these three. The assistance will be emergence-oriented agricultural support to 1350 rain fed farmers living in the target villages to secure harvest in the coming Deyr rainy season. The project will provide each family a package of farming seeds (sorghum (30kg) and cowpea (10kg)) and farming tools. The beneficiary farmers will be trained on the best agricultural practice/ good agricultural practice (GAP) to enhance and develop their capacities on farming. \nComplementary unconditional cash transfer (UCT) will be transferred to the target beneficiaries in a period of 3 months to improve immediate food access during the lean season. The monthly rate of the cash transfer is $30/family. This complies with March 2019 minimum expenditure basket (MEB) value recommended by CMWG in May 2019. It is anticipated that the cash transfer support will improve their food consumption, nutritional status of the children and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms that exposes women, children and other vulnerable groups to the risk of displacement. \nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and drought affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance.",

        "description": "The underperforming Deyr rains in 2018 and Gu rains in 2019 have heavily impacted the lives and livelihoods of households in Diinsoor which has led to an increase in the number of households in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and IPC Phase 4 (emergency). Rural populations in the hard-to-reach and undeserved areas around Diinsoor have been severely affected as result of poor agricultural production and limited access to services due to limited coverage by aid agencies. Household debt levels in this area remain high with many households utilizing negative coping mechanisms as a means to survive this lean period. Findings from a rapid needs assessment conducted by ACTED in Diinsoor on 16 and 23 June found that 62% of households do not regularly meet their food needs. Due to this dire situation, ACTED proposes an emergency short-term response to address the acute food insecurity and alleviate the humanitarian needs. The project will provide life-saving support to 1,614 vulnerable and drought affected households (9,684 individuals) through unconditional cash transfers in Diinsoor. ACTED plans to distribute four-months of consecutive unconditional cash transfers to these households from August until November 2019. Overall, these activities align with the Food Security cluster objective to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phase vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods. Moreover, the project aligns with the Somalia HRP 2019 objective to provide life-saving and life sustaining integrated assistance to reduce acute humanitarian needs and excess mortality among the most vulnerable people. Unconditional cash transfers act as a measure to prevent further deterioration of the food security of households and act as a buffer against the continued impact of the failed rains. These unconditional transfers in Diinsoor provide a quick response to increasing needs and enable households to access the functioning markets in Diinsoor.",

The project also seeks to conduct protection monitoring in Balad, Xudur and Wajid in order to provide critical protection related data to inform future interventions due to both absence of protection related information and to the increasing influx of newly conflict displaced people into the District witnessed in the last months. \n\nJointly with the protection monitoring activities, the key focus of the project will be providing Case management services for UASC through immediate care, referrals and family tracing as well as response to GBV survivors. The project will establish referral system in schools and support community-based Child Protection Mechanisms for quick and efficient referrals of children with protection needs through service mapping within the community and in the schools (community child protection committees and School Management Committees). This project will strengthen service mapping to facilitate appropriate referrals, coordination and linkages in service delivery to ensure quality comprehensive services to unaccompanied and separated children (children at risk of being recruited by armed forces or armed groups and gender based violence (GBV) survivors. The project will further improve prevention and response to separation of children from their families through family tracing and reunification activities and provision of comprehensive case management and psycho-social support including emergency care, referral to INTERSOS medical teams trained in CMR, access tailored material assistance, and follow up on the services for gender based violence survivors. Capacity building of CPWG to strengthen and improve identification of cases and increase their knowledge on child protection minimum standards will also be provided. Moreover, by promoting meaningful access, safety and dignity in our intervention.\nINTERSOS will conduct awareness that will focus on rights of children and men and women, roles and responsibilities of children, causes and consequence of separation as well as consequences of the incidences of gender based violence, Mine risk education, identification and reporting unaccompanied and separated children and GBV survivors, services available for Gender Based Violence survivors and unaccompanied and separated children as well as appropriate referrals in place in the target location. \nMoreover, based on the lessons learnt from the previous SHF and UNFPA funded project in the same target location, there is need to scale up protection activities including improving the quality of response services, particularly medical care, psycho social support, case management and emergency safe spaces.\n\nFurthermore, In Balad, Xudur and Wajid, INTERSOS will conduct and strengthen protection monitoring in areas of settlement of returnees and IDPs through community based protection monitors working with CSOs in order to ensure that quality evidence based reports about protection issues and human rights violations and systematic collection of protection related data are produced to inform better response and advocacy. This action aims at responding to the current crisis of newly conflict displaced people that are coming to the District from nearby villages in order to seek refuge.",

The target group will be selected from those impacted by drought with limited humanitarian support due to access difficulties and blockade. \n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable such as the marginalized, unaccompanied children, older persons, persons with disability, single women, pregnant and lactating mothers, single headed-households, persons with chronic illness or psychological condition, large families and/or families with babies, toddlers or children attending school, persons at risk as identified by protection officers and those living in the open or in makeshift buuls without adequate access to shelter. The project team will undertake a vulnerability assessment involving documenting of household profiles in the target area to identify the most vulnerable who are in urgent need for shelter assistance. Data will be collected through a number of methods including structured interviews with households heads, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and direct site observation. Collected data to inform beneficiary selection will also be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area as needed to avoid overlap. Mindful of the Somali context and utilizing its expertise in target locations, AVORD will pay attention to issues of diversity in the targeting process. \n\nFollowing need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries, AVORD will provide affected households with standard NFI kits comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, I Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Torch and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. The proposed content in each set is based on current Shelter Cluster standards for people in humanitarian emergencies. Since there are no functioning NFI markets in No.50, AVORD will use an in-kind modality for provision of NFIs. Besides, emergency shelters will be constructed for newly displaced households living in the open or under deplorable shelter conditions. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with relevant line ministries of the South West Administration and No.50 District Authorities to secure land tenure for a minimum of 5 years before the construction of emergency shelters.\n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.\n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek Integration with other clusters and own interventions in the region to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

        "description": "FSNAU post deyr 2018 assessment indicated critical levels of acute malnutrition among rural and pastoral populations with critical GAM gt15 and Serious SAM rates reported in Bakool region. The ongoing Gu rains 2019 (April to June) started late and have performed poorly and are likely to further aggravate the vulnerability of drought affected population including IDPs, poor host communities in Elbarde in Bakool region. These IDPs and poor host communities experience limited access to basic services including access to WASH services. The contributing factors include drought, dry jilaal season (January \u2013March 2019), displacement coupled poor WASH infrastructure. The prolonged drought in Bakool region led to limited access to sustained safe drinking water and increased risks related to  acute water diarrhea and malnutrition among population in Elbarde district in Bakool region. \nAccording to HIDIG WASH assessment conducted between 27- 28 May  2019 indicated that majority of affected population (80%) in ELBARDE district can't afford the cost of water due to increased price of water (55% increase) exposing thousands of families to walk more than 45 minutes for water collection which expose women and adolescent girls risks for gender-based violence. The assessment report indicated that, between 70-80% of shallow wells (26/38 wells in the assessed locations) are on open source condition and hence expose to contamination of water and to increases incidences of AWD cases. In addition, HIDIG/UNICEF health facility report in May 2019 indicated that AWD and skin diseases were among top five disease reported. To respond this alarming situation, the proposed project will improve access to WASH services for a total of 23000 drought/AWD affected communities (including 5750 women , 6900 girls, 6900 boys and 3450 men) IDPs and host communities in Elbarde district in Bakool region. The organization proposes sustained solution to improve access to WASH services services of the affected people in line with Somali WASH cluster response plan:\nWater: 1. Provision of sustained access to safe drinking water to through construction/rehabilitation of one boreholes equipped with hybrid and supplied water to two kiosks through piping system to two kiosks. Extension and construction of water supply systems in IDP camps benefiting 12000 drought affected men, women, girls and boys in Elbarde district. \n2. Construction/ rehabilitation of 12 shallow wells with hand pumps benefiting at least 11000 drought /AWD affected communities in Elbarda district \n3.  To ensure the sustainability and the management of water facilities, HIDIG will ensure to enhance the capacity of WASH committees to keep the maintenance and operation of the water source after the project is faced out.  HIDIG will ensure the maintenance and the appropriate use of water facilities in close coordination and coordination with IDPs mainly camp committees (men and women). \nSanitation :Construct 100 flood proof gender sensitive desludging latrines with hand washing facilities and with inside and outside lockable door to ensure the privacy of women and girls. around men, women and children are equally\n Hygiene promotion activities : HP will carry out comprehensive hygiene and sanitation promotion awareness campaign to promote the adaption of good hygiene and sanitation practices to affected men, women and children. \nSustainability : The rehabilitated  water sources (boreholes) will also serve as the main water supply sources to support neighboring villages with water trucking in the recent dry seasons.ill .The propose WASH investments will help affected communities in accessing sustainable water sources and eventually  reduce the impact of recurrent droughts ,climate shocks and improve their resilience in long run",

        "description": "Somalia remains among the worst humanitarian crises in the world. Persistent and complex series of natural and manmade humanitarian crises undermine food security in Somalia. According to the FSNAU- FEWS NET- Post Deyr Technical release IN Feb 2019, more than 1.5 million people will face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) through June 2019 and an additional 3.4 million people are classified as Stressed (IPC 2), which brings the total number of people in Somalia facing acute food insecurity through mid-2019 to 4.9 million. In addition, 903,100 children under the age of five years will likely face acute malnutrition in 2019, including 138,200 who are likely to be severely malnourished. \n\nTension and occasional clashes between Somaliland and Puntland over the contested Sool and Sanaag regions has led to displacement of more than 1000 households to nearby locations. According to reports from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency, the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume anytime. Baidoa district is one of the main hubs for IDPs and presents critical gaps in terms of humanitarian coordination and information as well as service provision. Drought conditions combined with a proliferated conflict with Al Shabab has exacerbated displacement. An estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance, including Baidoa and Sanaag IDPs. Conditions for IDPs are likely to deteriorate unless humanitarian support is scaled-up. \n\nIn the presented context, through CCCM, ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement these activities in 42 IDP sites in both Sanaag and Baidoa 39 previously supported IDP sites in Baidoa (ref: SOM-18/3485/SA1/CCCM-WASH-Shelter/INGO/8671) to build on the gains achieved through the SHF integrated support by focusing on capacity building, self-management and handover of activities to communities 3 new IDP sites (Karasharka, Fadhigaab, El-Midgaan) in El-Afweyne district of Sanaag, targeting a largely undeserved area. 6,443 HHs (approximately 38,658 people) in Baidoa and 1,222HHs (approximately 7,332 people) in Sanaag, a total of 7,665HHs will benefit from this intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas.",

        "description": "This project seeks towards the strengthening camp coordination and camp management in order to ensure equitable access to services and protection for displaced persons in informal settlements. People displaced to informal sites do not have their basic needs met due to the inconsistent provision of services or exclusion from accessing humanitarian support as a result of poor targeting of sites. This project seeks SHF allocation towards the strengthening camp coordination and camp management in order to ensure equitable access to services and protection for displaced persons in Banadir region. Majority of IDPs in Banadir region settle in informal and unplanned settlements where the conditions are very poor and forced eviction is a common threat, and where newly displaced people join those whose displacement has become protracted. Many are displaced multiple times. CCCM will strengthen the predictability and effectiveness of multi sectorial interventions at site level through continuous mapping of displacement settings, improved community participation and continuous monitoring.\n\nNoFYL is aware of challenges existing around land and property tenure arrangements, including customary access rights to land when selecting sites for the construction of the community centers. Where the land or property is privately held, NoFYL will consult with relevant stakeholders to obtain authorization and a long term formal agreement from owners to ensure long term sustainability of project constructions. \n\nThrough this project, NoFYL will reach 4,203 HHs in 7 IDP settlements with a total target beneficiary of 19,218 in Deynille and Kaxda districts with necessary services through coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stake holders and other partners. Targets in Deynille being the following camps Dayax Centre (550HH), Dheegan Bille (437HH), and Sabriye IDP camps (816HH) while Kaxda the project will target Samawade Camp (500HH), Alanfutow (270HH) Husungow (360HH), Ceel Hareeri (270HH) and Alhidaya IDP camps (1000HH).",

This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including setting up and strengthening of camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of temporary, multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping and site monitoring will be undertaken in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nAn integral part of the proposed intervention is to support community led site maintenance activities through cash for work schemes to ensure upkeep of sites. During the course of project duration, AVORD will also distribute a range of tools for effective disaster and solid waste management. Critical site infrastructure including 240 latrines and 40 main gates will be upgraded to minimize protection risks and enhance safety at sites. In the selection of beneficiaries for cash-for-work activities, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

        "description": "The education system has suffered widespread loss and damage, resulting in limited capacity and resources.\nAccess to education has reached a historic low, with more than three million children today out of schools in Somalia. The national Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) is 30 per cent for primary education and 26 per cent for secondary level education (HRP 2019 report). \nThe project intends to target 16 IDP sites in Baidoa town. The identified camps are among the 391 IDP camps which were in great majority set up during 2017 and which are home to 47,873 HHs (CCCM report, DSA, March 2019). \nThis project aims to achieve access to education for IDP children by targeting 2,185 out of school children (1,090 boys and 1,095 girls) living inside IDP settlements in Baidoa to ensure their access to school thus enhancing their safety and protection as well as the enjoyment of their rights. Out of the total 2,185 children, 2,060 are primary school age children while 125 are secondary school age children and/or children above 15 years.\nThis project will ensure that emergency and crisis affected children/youth have access to safe and protective learning environments in the partner schools. This will be done through a comprehensive action to respond to immediate and longer term needs of the children. The learners will be provided with access to food, water and scholastic material and children with protection concerns will be supported through strengthening/creating referral mechanisms where necessary, to specialized services. Girl  education will be at the center of the project encompassing all activities and it will be promoted with trainings, advocacy campaigns and community mobilization in support of changing negative attitudes and practices. Adolescent school aged girls will also be provided with sanitary pads in support to improving their attendance rates in classrooms and CECs will be sensitized on the importance of girls\u2019 education during the back to school campaigns. Personal hygiene and sanitation, school personnel and parents\u2019 commitment to provide leadership in promoting girls\u2019 education are proven to be two key factors in improving girls\u2019 attendance rates as recommended by the beneficiaries during FGDs held by INTERSOS staff in the current SHF EiE project implemented din Wajid and Education Cannot Wait project implemented last year in Baidoa. \nThe foreseen construction and rehabilitation of temporary learning spaces will ensure access to a safe and enabling learning environment. Additionally, capacity building will be conducted for CECs and teachers on pedagogy, child protection, child wellbeing and psychosocial support. Teachers will also be supported through payment of monthly incentives corresponding to 100 USD for a period of 8 months. \nAmong the 16 targeted settlements, the 3 IDP camps located within the Horseed urban village called Shimo Tiyeglow, Kalimey and Bohaladi will be provided with two new learning spaces and segregated gender latrines since no education service is present in this area. \nChild protection is mainstreamed into the project. One of the key focus of the project will be indeed to prevent and respond to children with protection concern considering the school as a safe space and an entry point to enhance children\u2019s protective environment. The project will conduct regular analysis of the situation of children regarding causes and patterns of protection concerns and will respond accordingly through prevention and strengthening or creating quick referral pathways, conduct service mapping to facilitate appropriate referrals and strengthen coordination and linkages in service delivery to ensure quality comprehensive services to the children with protection concerns.\n Building communities\u2019 resilience and promoting the reintegration of children in the formal education system.

The project will be implemented in IDP camps of Galkacayo where thousands of emergencies affected children are denied of their right to basic education due to lack of support and school facilities in their settlements. In conflicts or crises situation, enrollment rates fall, and drop-out increases and children are denied access to education and therefore remain out-of-school. \n\nThe project will adopt an integrated approach to promoting safe, inclusive and quality learning opportunities for the children affected by crisis and provide essential support for students and schools. The support include the construction and rehabilitation of temporary and permanent learning spaces, distribution of school equipment and learning materials, construction of water storage facilities and gender-segregated latrines provision of drinking water delivery of hygiene promotion services and provision of live-saving services such as provision of school meals. \n\nThe project will also give special emphasis on the protection and the well-being of children by establishing and training community child protection committee at schools, training teachers on psychosocial support as well developing and rolling out of community-based child protection mechanism. Besides, referral centers will be mapped and assessed to refer and assist children who required referral for further support. Child protection focal points will be recruited at schools while all schools will have active child to child clubs. The purpose of these activities are to promote the safety and protection of students at schools, make school safe and child-friendly zone and identify and support children with protection and psychosocial support. This will also cultivate a culture that respects child rights and promotes their protection. \n\nThe ultimate aim of the project is to ensure greater access in safe learning environment and improved learning for children affected by emergencies to reduce violence, avoid further marginalization and loss of another generation. \n\nIn order to improve the quality of education, teachers will be trained on child-centered teaching methods and psycho-social support, and given emergency incentives.  Community Education Committees (CECs), local authorities and partners will be trained on psycho-social support skills, emergency preparedness, contingency planning and related issues. The proposed intervention will also improve the education authorities\u2019 and CECs capacity to plan for and respond to education in emergency situations.\n\nThe project will target and support a total of 6750 students, 120 teachers and 140 CEC members.Beneficiaries will be selected through participatory and predetermined selection criteria prioritizing the most affected and needy people and 48% will be girls. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age and diversity dis-segregated data. \n\nThe project will be directly implemented by NRC in collaboration with Puntland State ministry of Educations and Education clusters. A comprehensive monitoring framework will be developed for the project and information including attendance, drop out will be collected using Kobo toolbox and analyzed and shared.

Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacities and improve school preparedness against future disasters. Child- and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. RI will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. RI, in collaboration with the appropriate ministries, will map existing referral pathways and service providers and link schools to these services. Where pathways are weak or non-functional, RI will strengthen them to ensure effective response to child protection concerns. To monitor the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, RI will facilitate joint review workshops with schools, service providers, and relevant government ministries. Through engagement with ministry officials such as MoEampHE Gender Focal Points, Office of Puntland Human Rights Defender and CECs, RI will leverage the respective agency apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established referral mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools and the larger communities.",

        "description": "The detrimental effects of underperforming rains are impacting the parts of population that is still trying to recover from the effects of an extended drought in northern and central Somalia. The deteriorating food security outlook, combined with the worsening malnutrition calls for a rapid and well-targeted scale up of response to save lives and support recovery. The project is aimed at improving the ability of vulnerable HHs to meet their basic needs, supports protection and recovery of livelihood assets through life-saving UCT, animal treatment services and emergency fodder provision in Burco district Togdheer region. The project targets 1137 vulnerable drought affected pastoralist HHs including women, men, boys, girls, and female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The drought has severely and directly affected pastoral communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk. This has led to household food insecurity, sharp increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and animal use. Additionally, the drought affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debt and therefore not able to purchase veterinary drugs, fodder and water, which is essential when livestock body condition is so poor thus susceptible to opportunistic diseases.\n\nCOOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation, the beneficiary women, girls and the disabled will be included in decision making processes, monitoring so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, unconditional cash transfer will be provided to 1137 drought affected pastoralists HHs including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services. \n\nTo protect key livelihoods assets of pastoralists, livestock belonging to 400 vulnerable pastoralists HHs (including female headed) affected by drought who cannot afford costs for livestock drugs and treatment services will be provided with treatment. This activity will prevent deaths and reduction in production through treatment of livestock against bacterial infections. Moreover, emergency fodder provision for core breeding herd belonging to 200 HHs during stress periods will prevent losses and ensure milk availability for children. The activity is aimed at protecting livestock assets of the drought affected pastoral communities from starvation, opportunistic infections and death. This activity is envisaged to reduce workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, GBV  and exploitation associated with searching of livestock feed and transporting fodder for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed livestock feed provision\nIn summary the following activities will be carried out:\n1. Provide unconditional cash to 1137 HH. 2.) Provide livestock treatment support for 400 HH. 3.) Emergency fodder provision for core breeding herd belonging to 200 HHs during stress periods to prevent losses and ensure milk availability for children.",

This overall goal of the response is to contribute towards improving food access and availability, animal health, livestock productivity and livelihoods restoration. This in turn will enable beneficiary households to get access to milk, income, food and enhance nutritional status of their families including children. VSF Germany will closely work with other humanitarian actors in the areas to avoid duplication of efforts through regular coordination and monitoring of similar activities at field level and build synergies. This up-scaling Action is expected to benefit a total of 650 households (3,900 individuals) in the target district (Zeylac). Specific intervention include: Provision of unconditional cash transfer (for immediate food access) Animal health services (treatment and vaccination campaign) (to protect and restore livelihoods).Animal health services will be delivered in partnership with Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development (MoLFD). Thus, implementation of these key interventions in the target areas would yield multiple benefits 1) prevent vulnerable households from employing negative coping strategies and, 2) restore the livelihoods and due to healthy and nourished animals hence improved milk availability and 3) prevent loss of key household assets and thus build resilience of target community . The target households will also be linked with local veterinary drug shops and Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW) in order to get required animal health services. The Action is aligned with the standard allocation strategies and food security cluster objective 1 to improve the immediate access to food objective 2, to protect and restore livelihoods related to food and income sources and objective 3, to support resilience of vulnerable populations against shocks.",

The project will provide lifesaving support to 7,704 people assessed to be in acute food insecurity, \u2018Crisis\u2019 and \u2018Emergency\u2019 phases of IPC (3 and 4)  by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and safety net support.\n\nThe project proposes lifesaving interventions that are gender sensitive, adapt centrality of protection and that mainstream gender and protection in the delivery methods proposed. The project will specifically prioritize destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the two Districts) and other households as identified in the Hobyo Districts that fall into the IPC 3 and 4. The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the failure of the Deyr 2018 season rains in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project seeks to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food to 733 vulnerable households through Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) for 3 months with each household being entitled US $71 as per MEB for Mudug Region. The project will undertake a vulnerability assessment in selected locations of the targeted 4 locations in the District (2 settlements with IDPs and 2 settlements with high number of vulnerable host households) with the findings being used in developing the criteria for selection of the planned UCT beneficiaries and informing on protection needs.  Priority for the UCTs beneficiaries will be given to women-led households from the most vulnerable among recently displaced, non-displaced and socially marginalized communities in each of the respective target District. The UCTs planning will also be supported by a market analysis undertaken in the District (undertaken by the FSL Team) to determine the capacity of local markets to absorb the resources extended to the beneficiaries. \n\nIn addition the project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 451 unskilled laborers rehabilitating 3 Water Pans.  Each unskilled labourer of the planned 410 CfW laborers shall get $ 5 per day for 30 days and 41 skilled laborers at the rate of US 7. A total of 6,000 CUM water impounding capacity will be added to the current existing 1,080 CUM in the 3 targeted dams in Hobyo District. The project will also support the protection of the core breeding and milking herds normally under the care of women in the rural and urban settlements through supportive treatments. This will involve the creation of the requisite animal treatment capacity (currently missing) involving the provision of fixed value animal treatment vouchers.  A total of 1,000 animals in the district are targeted where each HH is estimated to be keeping 10 Shoats. A total of 100 HHs will be targeted in the District. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure that the project gets feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and arising gaps that will require humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below average rainfall for the coming Gu 2019 season as indicated by FEWSNET in its January 2019 update.\n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular helps make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project to ensure it provides the women safety and protection required.",

The focus of this intervention will be to treat and prevent common causes of morbidity and mortality. This intervention will seek to prioritize the provision of care and immunization for children lt5 years of age, pregnant and lactating women.  Diagnosis and treatment of common causes of morbidity, including diarrhea, ARI, malaria, and other targeted illnesses will take place according to IMCI guidelines. Monthly data to the respective District Health Management Information System (DHMIS) will be submitted as well as weekly surveillance data to WHO with MOH officials in copy to support the established CSR/Early Warning and Response Network (EWARNS) mechanism in Somalia. CARE will also train and support staff in completion of DHMIS reports during the MCH training and in subsequent monitoring to ensure accurate data collection. Outbreak investigation, rumor verification, timely response and control of communicable disease in conjunction with other stakeholders and clusters will be done.\n\n\nCare will support community health activities including the provision of individual and group counselling on positive heath practices supporting the provision of community links to basic health, nutrition, IYCF and WASH care and sensitization. To extend case management of childhood illness beyond health facilities, Community Health Workers (CHWs) will be trained on prevalent conditions such as management of fever, diarrhea and respiratory illnesses, and malaria. They will also refer all pregnant women to health facilities for care and encourage safe deliveries at facilities. The focus will be on early case identification and treatment, referral and compliance to treatment using the community\u2019s own mechanisms. CHWs will be trained on referral systems, and equipped with referral slips and a register to refer cases to the static MCHs. CHWs will be tasked with dissemination of pertinent health information, including preventive reproductive health and immunization activities, and in disease surveillance.\n\nReproductive health services will be provided and include the provision of equitable access to prenatal and postnatal health services provision of access to facility-based safe deliveries at static sites training of health staff on early detection, treatment and referral of pregnancy-related complications. CARE will establish referral pathways for CEMOC and complicated IMCI cases to three district hospitals currently supported by CARE (Lascanood, Erigavo and Badhan).  CARE will therefore support training for service providers focused on Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), psycho social support in coordination with GBV working groups in target areas.CARE will conduct training  for midwives and nurses in collaboration with CARE protection team, MOH and UNFPA on CMR. Targeted health workers will be sensitized about the health consequences of GBV and trained to identify and refer GBV survivors, while ensuring confidentiality and respect, response to survivors in a non-stigmatized way and provision of clinical care.

HIDIG will leverage of its ongoing WASH and nutrition activities to provide access to an integrated life-saving health services to an estimated 21,000 drought affected and urban poor host communities in Baidoa district through one static health facilities, and six mobile clinics, with a focus on maternal and child Health in partnership with the Ministries of Health and other healthcare service providers. The SHF funds will be used to support a critical response integrated with WASH and nutrition to respond to the health needs of malnourished children and women in Baidoa. The proposed response aims to respond to only areas with critical rates of malnutrition and measles and suspected AWD/Cholera hotspots where immediate provision of lifesaving emergency healthcare is intended to be carried out. For example, Bay region accounts for 48% of all measles cases in South Somalia which make up five regions. HIDIG implemented health project in Baidoa district in partnership with SHF in 2018, which has ended. To build on the gains achieved in 2018 and the ongoing routine immunization support from UNICEF, the proposed project will provide free emergency obstetric care including ANC, skilled delivery and PNC to 1,050 eligible women and improve referral system through provision of timely transportation. Overall, 21,000 direct beneficiaries, including 5,040 girls, 4,200 boys, 6,510 women, 5,250 men will benefit from the services. The organization will conduct routine and supplementary measles immunization targeted at children under-five in target areas. In addition, the capacity of 35 staff will be improved through training so that frontline staff in disaster events marked by a sudden or gradual increase in demand for healthcare services and a related decrease in the supply of resources available to provide such care can act. This will result in a community healthcare-sector response that can implement a variety of surge capacity strategies that include steps taken to reduce demand for care, e.g., the implementation of community-based triage capabilities and risk communication about when to seek care and the strengthening of referral care capacity in addition to better described inpatient care strategies. In this context, fifty community members will also obtain an increased knowledge and skills on community management of childhood illnesses. HIDIG is an active health cluster member in Bay, Bakol and Hiiraan regions and will actively share information with the cluster, UNOCHA and the Ministry of Health, both at state level and federal. The target district is accessible, and the organization has an active PCA with UNICEF in reducing maternal mortality rate through skilled deliveries and strengthening referral system in Somalia. These proposed interventions adhere to the SHf\u2019s life-saving criteria as they respond to time-critical requirements and contribute to reducing the loss of lives. Bay region has more than 12,000 people in IPC 4 and 176,000 in IPC 3, indicating the scale of the acute malnutrition in the region. Because of this, HIDIG requires support and additional resources are urgently required as health and nutrition facilities are seeing more people in need. HIDIG will coordinate its interventions with respective line ministries and other NGOs to ensure there is no duplication in the response and that critical gaps are covered",

The project will deliver lifesaving emergency health services including maternal, neonatal and child health through 3 static and 3 mobile health facilities to meet the needs of both host communities and IDPs that are recovering from the effects of persistent droughts and armed conflicts in the district of El-bur  in Galgadud region. \nThe health facilities of El-Bur  district (3 MCHs) that will be supported by New ways with this project will provide ANC, skilled deliveries, PNC, consultation, nutrition status screening and IYCF, hygiene promotion, and treatment of both under and over fives for common illnesses, immunization services, early detection and treatment of communicable diseases, treating people with common mental disorders within the general framework of available health services, ensuring that primary healthcare workers are able to apply key psycho-social and behavioral science skills, as well as ensuring an efficient referral system for those who require more specialized care, Health seeking behavior and hygiene promotion. New ways will organize training of qualified nurses who are member staff of the facilities on mental health in Gur-El for 2 weeks. Facilitators will be brought from Mogadishu. The trained staff will also facilitate the reduction of stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness, which will result in improved demand for services. It will not be easy, but certainly will be a good start for the community. Mental health service integrated into the primary health care services will be of a paramount importance, particularly in El-Bur district, a district that has been at the centre of armed conflict for the last ten years without receiving practically any health service for this entire period of time, let alone mental health service. The project will benefit 36,400 which include 16,761  women, 12,594 men, 3,617 boys and 3,411 girls that includes both vulnerable host communities and IDPs, who will benefit from services delivered by qualified and skilled health personnel. New ways will recruit a medical doctor with \u201cMental health\u201d training, who will be stationed in Guri-El. He will be dealing with referred patient from El-Bur and other patients from the region he will be also supporting people living HIV from our HIV program in Galgadud.",

According to FSNAU post deryr 2018  assessment report indicated that deterioration of  nutrition situation in Sool region with GAM rate (lt15%) due to high morbidity, low immunization ,Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. Additionally, extreme water and pasture shortages have led to an increased incidence of acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/ cholera outbreaks, which have already been reported in many villages in Sool region. According to rapid assessment conducted by KAALO in February 2019  showed, majority of the health facilities in the assessed villages lacked basic supplies and staff incentives as well as shortage of appropriate reproductive health kits, supplies and commodities. KAALO in partnership with SHF and UNICEF has been implementing an integrated health and WASH project at target location since 2015.The health facilities are facing extreme funding gaps, shortage of supplies and poor referral system. KAALO proposes to scale up its health interventions to save lives, mitigate emergencies, reduce mortality amp morbidity and fill gaps of health services for drought affected people through 2 fixed health facilities with two mobile clinics targeting 28,000 direct beneficiaries including (7000 WCBA, 5600 children under five) in Sool region. The  sexual and reproductive health SRH intervention consists in supporting the provision of basic and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services to all people at target districts and ensuring particularly the good health and well-being of mothers and newborns. This is done by supporting national health facilities in strengthening the health system strategy, equipping conflict-affected health facilities with emergency reproductive health kits, training health workers IMCI, BEmOC for reproductive health and deploying mobile teams in hard-to-reach areas to directly support the provision of services. Qualified nurses/ midwives will provide preventative and curative services, antenatal care, skilled delivery, postnatal care, treatment of common illnesses. The child health services include immunization of children under five years and promotion services including health education, growth monitoring, de-worming and supplementation with vitamin A. The mobile health teams will provide primary health Services for undeserved and hard to reach areas. They will also provide basic mental health and Psychosocial Support services and referral services. At the end of the project , a total of 28000 affected community (7000 women, 8400 girls, 8400 boys and 4200 men) improved and increased availability of health care including: promotive, preventative and curative services , reproductive health  and improved case management of childhood illnesses through two fixed health facilities with mobile outreach teams in Sool region.",

        "description": "The Nutrition and health situation remains fragile in Hobyo with children and women being most vulnerable. The key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional health system. Tied to that is minimal capacity available in the nutrition and health sector and  poor community literacy levels  (UNICEF 2018 WHO 2017). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease (UNICEF,2018, FSNAU,2018).\n Although there has been progress noted in service provision and policy development in Somalia including: roll out of national development plan with inclusion of a section on Nutrition and mainstreaming it to sectors (SNDP,2017), 2017-20 health sector strategic plan (FMoH,2017) and other health related policies, frameworks and guidelines,a lot still needs to be done to actualized these.\nIts important to note that disparities in health outcomes among Somali children and women still exist. These are based on: their exposure to violence and insecurity, access, gender and ethnic groupings, and the stability of communities/clan structure. Addressing these inequities, remains a priority (UNICEF,2018). This brings to light the fact that the situation in Hobyo  could be worse than national statistics considering that factors mentioned above fully exist here.\nServices in Hobyo barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure and harsh climate conditions. Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2018SAF UK,2018 SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2019). There are reports of drought and food shortages causing many to leave there homes in search of food and water. The is therefore need for urgent attention if the situation is to be controlled.\nGender issues that lock out significant others increasing negative social pressure on women not to adapt behaviors beneficial to health, should be addressed for positive nutrition outcomes to be realized. Finally capacity of service providers and locals communities to control malnutrition should be improved for quality service, resilient communities and sustainable projects.\nThe proposed interventions will link with  cluster objective one, two and four, and SHF 2019 1 standard allocation core elements  one,three, four, five and six, which cover provision of immediate life saving and time critical interventions, focus on communities affected by deteriorating nutrition of GAMgt15% , integration of services across sectors, protection mainstreaming and rapid response  enabling the most urgent scaling up of essential humanitarian activities,\nInterventions will also seek to provide primary ,secondary and tertiary prevention for acute malnutrition, build resilience to cushion against shocks in future and provide a platform to discuss and initiate durable solutions  in conjunction with other clusters and relevant bodies thus preventing shocks and ensuring protection.\nSAF UK has been implementing nutrition (OTP,TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) and health projects in north Hobyo for 2 years, but only covering  Afbarwaqo and surrounding villages, reporting huge impact \nThis proposed project seeks to scale up treatment of MAM beyond our current coverage through additional 3 fixed sites in health facilities and 4 mobile sites to access hard to reach areas. Additionally,the current  supplementary feeding project funded by WFP expires on 30th March 2019. We hope to sustain these services (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) ,avoiding gaps. \nOur proposal is  to provide supplementary feeding interventions (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP)  further integrating with health  project in all proposed sites for cost effective sustainable project",

        "description": ".The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Somaliland and Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Areas of particular concern include Northern Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed, and Galkacayo IDP which are experiencing emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. GAM rates of 10-14.9% are present in Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer. Similarly, the nutrition situation in Galkacayo IDPs is at a critical level and may deteriorate further without humanitarian assistance. According to the nutrition cluster nutrition burden estimate that was released in February 2019, in Galkayo IDPs, the nutrition situation was at a critical level with a GAM rate of 20.2% which is above the emergency threshold of GAMgt15%. Despite the high (estimated to be 61,092 by the health cluster) caseload of children with acute malnutrition in these regions, access to live saving nutrition services remains limited. In order to address these gaps, the proposed project will improve access and provide nutrition services to children aged 0 to 59 months and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) with acute malnutrition through detection and treatment in the targeted nutrition sites. Particular attention will be on the following activities: Training of Community Volunteers in the identification and referral of malnutrition cases to Save the Children   supported   nutrition centers, and mothers trained in mother-led MUAC to enlarge coverage with close monitoring from Save the Children to prevent wrong referrals and ensure quality of the screening and understanding of the community Provision of Outpatient Therapeutic Feeding (OTP) services for children aged 6-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) for Moderately Acute Malnourished children (MAM) and PLW through mobile outreach teams. Referring children aged 0-59 months identified with SAM coupled with medical complication, and SAM infants aged under 6 months with or without medical complications to the nearest stabilization center. The proposed nutrition project is mainly targeting Galkacayo IDPs (27), Awdal (30) and Woqooyi Galbeed (21) and Digaale and Jimaale HFs in Hargeisa IDPs locations, that are most affected by the current drought in Somalia. The project also promotes and supports optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding practices through the screening of breastfeeding difficulties amongst mothers of children under two years of age, provision of one to one counselling for mothers and caretakers with difficulties with regards to Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices and raising awareness of caregivers and relatives on the importance of appropriate IYCF. The project is targeting 59,971 direct beneficiaries, 27,830 will be from the IDPs while 32,141 beneficiaries will be from the Host Communities. In addition, a total of  96,904 beneficiaries will be reached with key IYCF messages in the targeted areas. The proposed project will incorporate learnings from previous projects on how women and girls can participate meaningfully in nutrition interventions.One of the learnings is that mothers in the IDP settlements a lead role in championing for IYCF interventions once they receive sufficient training, this is because they gained a deeper understanding of the importance of breastmilk to children and were willing to breastfeed exclusively if they had a source of livelihood.Another learning is that women can be powerful agents of change when it comes to hygiene promotion once they understand the benefits of good hygiene practices and this has a positive impact on the whole community particularly as women tend to be the sole custodians of household and child rearing chores.",

The accumulated figure reflect 90% of the total burden of the target districts based on 2019 nutrition cluster burden estimates as well as the projected figures for the first half of the year 2020. \n\nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somali Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project.\n\nThe project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the nearest stabilization centers using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will manage 22 fixed OTP sites and 2 stabilization centres (6 OTP fixed sites for Zeila district 9 fixed OTP sites and 1 SC for Berbera district, 6 fixed OTP sites for Hargeisa district 1 fixed OTP and 1 SC for Gabiley district). Efforts will be made to ensure integration of OTP and TSFP sites where possible.  In order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCH facilities. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \n\nIn addition, the project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. In order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children.

This coupled with low levels of community awareness on issues of GBV stigma and other cultural barriers which encourage impunity for breaches in laws and convections. In Kismayo there has been a steady increase in GBV cases since December 2017. This has been attributed to the increasing levels of conflict in Juba land, being one of many active military zones and presence of military frontlines in the identified locations and a high number of IDP camps adjacent to the military camps. Increased forced evictions within the camps have also exposed more women and children to the risk of GBV in the camps thus increasing their vulnerability. \n\nAll the project activities will be carried out to maximize community participation. Regular meetings and capacity building activities at the established women and girl safe space will seek to engage the community in project activities and support the establishment and development of community networks in order to strengthen local mechanisms for prevention and response. By providing support to existing community structures the project will also seek to create women safe spaces to improve protection and to widen support networks.

In drought affected regions, water scarcity and inadequate quality are leading causes of displacement and conflict, particularly in Puntland and Somaliland, where women and children must often travel over 30 minutes to reach drinking water points. Of the people in need and highly vulnerable, a large percentage are children, women and the elderly, who critically lack access to clean water and are acutely at risk of gender-related violence and high morbidity and mortality due to water-borne disease outbreaks. Many households lack access to adequate sanitation leading to frequent open defecation while safety of people, particularly women and children to access latrines and water points remains a serious concern and a serious risk for exposure to violence\n\nAn estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance in Sanaag IDPs. The climatic situation is exacerbated by conflict in the Sanaag region. According to reports including those from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency (HADMA), the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume. This would create further displacements and insecurity, and be a push factor towards areas where humanitarian actors are responding. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention for IDPs and rural communities in areas affected by drought aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustainable access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points and construction of new boreholes 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation.\n\nACTED will implement these activities in Karasharka, Huluul, Habarshiro, Kalshiikh and Elbuh of Sanaag Region Approximately 25,000 people (4,167 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination and collaboration among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs.

        "description": "According to Humanitarian Dashboard (issued on 22 February 2019) by the Somalia WASH Cluster, several regions of Somaliland and Puntland are experiencing severe shortage of water, due to the over-exploitation of already-limited resources and the breakdown of equipment \u2013 the construction and restoration of water points are subsequently needed. The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Some regions have experienced drought for several seasons. Bari is among the regions worst affected by poor rains, with large moisture deficits and drought conditions.\n\nThe recurrent drought together with nutrition crises and other natural emergencies combined with poor WASH coverage and influx of internally displaced people (IDP) in target regions of Bari including Ishkushuban, Bosasso (IDPs), Qardho (IDPs) highlight the need for Save the Children to continue providing emergency services to vulnerable communities. \n\nTherefore, Save the Children is proposing a 12 months WASH project targeting drought and conflict affected communities in Bari regions targeting Ishkushuban, Bosasso (IDPs), Qardho (IDPs) to provide immediate life-saving WASH services to the most vulnerable members of the community, reaching a total of 48,889 individuals (men: 14,373, women: 14,960, boys: 9,778 and girls: 9,778).\n\nThe proposed project aims to provide lifesaving emergency and sustainable WASH service through drilling of two new strategic boreholes and rehabilitation of three strategic boreholes complete with hybrid power system (solar and diesel power), distribution systems, storage tanks and new water kiosks, and rehabilitation of rain water harvesting berkeds in rural target communities. The project will also improve overall hygiene and sanitation of the target communities through the construction of 150 shared household latrines  affected by the drought.\n\nIn terms of centrality and mainstreaming of protection, the project targets to reduce the risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups while accessing water and sanitation facilities by providing gender segregated facilities and establishing the facilities within 500 meters\u2019 distance of the settlements. The project will also address gender issues by collecting gender and age disaggregated data. Save the Children will analyze this data to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Save the Children will ensure protection during access and utilization of services, to reduce the risk further. \n\nThe project beneficiaries will be selected through a community consultative process with the community leaders and local authorities in order to ensure that only those who meet the specified vulnerability criteria including women and girls, people living with disability, people from minority clans, female headed households,  child-headed households,  survivors of sexual and gender base violence,  and households with a high number of dependents (children, elderly, people with disabilities, pregnant and lactating mothers will be given high priority. Save the Children will maintain and expand synergies across all the programs by ensuring that this project is implemented alongside the other emergency response programs, such as nutrition and health programs, to ensure that benefits arising out of multiple actions to the same target groups are exponentially increased.\n\nThe project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected population. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project included construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion",

        "description": "Limited access to safe water in Somaliland is endemic and is worsening with prolonged drought. Poor, below-average rainfall in northern and central Somalia during the Deyr season of 2018 has resulted in a harsher than normal dry season. \nMost water sources across Sool and Sanaag regions in the north are not suitable for human consumption and approximately half of the birkads are damaged, and a quarter of them did not harvest any run-off because of the lack of rains. In addition, poor access to latrines leads to prevalent open defecation across Somalia/land. \nThe aim of the proposed project is to provide lifesaving support to and rebuild resilience of affected communities through providing sustainable solutions to water access. Oxfam prioritizes activities that enable communities to access continued water supply from existing groundwater sources, reduce the walking distance for women/girls to fetch water at a reduced cost, contain human feaces contaminating the environment and surface water sources, and promote behavioural change on personal hygiene and handwashing at critical times.\nOxfam is present in hard-to-reach and in some of the most neglected geographical areas of Sool and Sanaag regions and continues to prioritize presence based on where the highest \u2018unreached\u2019 needs lie. There is a committed and robust humanitarian team (over 30+) in Somalia based out of a main office, a field office, and two sub-offices. The current team has strong technical capacity in response management, with technical coordinators for WaSH and a robust 3-person MEAL team that guides quality and accountability of programming in the field. Working with partners on some interventions/responses, also affords good complementarity in understanding the local context and assuring 2-way sharing of technical knowledge and skills that could enrich growth and progress in addressing the needs of the target population. \n\n2 desalination units are proposed in Oog and Garadag. Oxfam will engage in a public private partnership with Boreal Light (which has expertise in operating desalination plants and can provide operation and management training) and the Somaliland Ministry of Water Resource Development (MoWRD). Oxfam already has good relationships and experience with both parties, having closely collaborated around 2 existing desalination units funded in other areas by other donors. The MoWRD supports and endorses desalination work in Somaliland. \n\nBoreal Light is a leading actor in this sector, specialized in renewable energy solutions for water treatment facilities. It manufactures affordable solar water desalination systems and has extensive expertise in the region, including Kenya and Somaliland. It has identified a local agent in Somaliland who will be responsible for operating, maintaining and managing the desalination units under the SHF project for a period 12 months. The training provided in this time will present a sustainable model after the end of the project period. \n\nTo ensure value for money for this funding and program complimentary, ACTED and Oxfam will coordinate on key activities in Sanaag. At project inception, there will be a training workshop on key learning from WASH programming in the region to share experience: e.g. borehole drilling, sharing supplier lists and good practices in drilling and rehabilitation works, engagement with communities and local authorities. Other topics are likely to cover hydreological surveys, desalination and solarization. WASHCO training to be jointly undertaken after asset completion. Cost savings will be on printing materials, vehicle, and stationary. Joint mapping of WASH facilities in El-Afweyn and Ainabo to assess status of available assets, beneficiaries reached and to analyze gaps and investments necessary to provide support. .A joint MampE exercise will be done twice in the project period.",

        "description": "DRC proposes to undertake a sustainable assistance to Disaster Affected Communities (DACs) through provision of sustainable WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) services. The SHF activities will complement the CERF emergency health and nutrition activities in the selected locations. The proposed project will also complement DRC's drought-targeted Integrated Emergency Responses in Somalia funded by OFDA. This will enable DRC to provide a complete assistance package to the drought affected communities in selected locations in the North-Western part of Somaliland. The region selected is Awdal which is the most affected region in the north by drought and the Tripical Cyclone Sagar in June 2018, causing displacement and also affecting the strategic water points that communities rely on during the dry spells. Therefore, the WASH assistance package will include - rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures construction of new water infrastructures equipping of boreholes with a hybrid pumping system (solar and generator) and distribution networks establishment of water committee to manage water points and ensure their sustainability. Where appropriate, DRC will partner with private borehole owners to supply water to catchment population and sign a tripartite MOU among the private borehole owner, DRC and Local Authorities. Where there are pressing needs especially in crowded IDP camps and among very vulnerable households, DRC will provide household-shared desludgable latrines. The latrines shall be shared among four (4) households. They shall be installed with hand-wash facility, a ramp to allow for easy access for PLDs especially the ones using a wheelchair and shall be installed with a door lockable from inside to ensure women feel secure while using them. DRC is equally piloting sanitation marketing in the south (Dollow and Baidoa), and will apply lessons learnt from these locations to this project. Overall, with rehabilitation of 5 boreholes,construction of 8 elevated tanks and installation of  portable water tanks DRC targets to reach 59,230 people of which 13623 men, 15400 women, 15400 boys and 14807 girls. This population includes 30% IDPs, 60% host community and 10% returnees. The other groups targeted include people affected by cyclone in Awdal considered the coastal population. With 200 desludgable latrines installed with hand wash facilities and sanitation kits, DRC will also reach 4800 people (1104 men, 1248 women, 1248 boys and 1200 girls) with sustainable access to adequate sanitation facilities.",

        "description": "This project aims at providing reliable and sustained access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities to target population residing in nine riverine villages in Jowhar district that are facing water shortages and have limited access to sanitation facilities. The target population was heavily affected by floods that occurred in 2018 where water supply infrastructures and sanitation facilities were severely damaged and are yet to be repaired. Poor rainfall received during the 2018 Deyr season and the ongoing dry conditions has resulted in critical water shortages and a rapid decline in the remaining water reservoirs in Jowhar district. The river Shabelle that is the main source of water and a vital source of livelihood for communities residing along the river has dried up once again in now four consecutive years.\n\nIn this context, WOCCA will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aimed at providing sustained access to safe water through the rehabilitation of 22 strategic wells and fitted with hand pumps. To reduce pressure on the few functioning wells 2 shallow wells will be constructed in Bardheere and Nuukay village. A water distribution system that will include pipeline extension, overhead tank and water kiosk with 8taps and a solar pumping system will be installed in Nuukay village so that more people including neighboring pastoral communities can benefit from the water since the well has a good yield. In Gashaanle village rehabilitation of a shallow well, water tank, kiosk, and installation of a solar pumping system will be done. Identification of these targeted locations for construction and rehabilitation was done in consultation with the community elders and the local authority. The water sources will be located 30m away from latrines to avoid contamination. Dewatering of the rehabilitated/constructed shallow wells and application of shock chlorination will be done to ensure that the water is safe for consumption. \n\nTo strengthen community ownership and ensure sustainability of WASH assets 130 Water management committee members (at least 40% of women) will be trained on operation, maintenance and safe water storage. The project staff and WMC members will be trained on DRR and protection mainstreaming. 310 gender-sensitive latrines with hand-washing facilities, raised to avoid flooding and fitted with locks from the inside to curb GBV will be constructed in the targeted villages. Women, girls and vulnerable groups will be consulted in siting and design of the WASH infrastructures to maximize safety, privacy and dignity. To ensure the WASH infrastructures endure future floods, WOCCA will incorporate DRR aspects in the design of the WASH infrastructures. Sensitization meetings will be held at the inception of the project with all project stakeholders including groups at risk of exclusion to inform them about the project objectives, scope, beneficiary selection criteria, and beneficiary entitlement and roles. Accountability to the affected population will be enhanced through the provision of a feedback hotline to beneficiaries where they can provide feedback and complaints. To ensure quality in the project outputs the project staff will continuously monitor and report on project indicators. WOCCA will also share GPS coordinates of all WASH structures and monthly project reports with the WASH cluster and donor. Signing off and handing over of WASH structures to beneficiaries upon completion will be done through community elders, government officials and religious leaders. WOCCA will also adhere to the principles of \"Do no harm\" through not creating any partial, nepotism, conflict-oriented and sensitive issues within the project beneficiaries.",

Humanitarian needs have increased drastically due to below-average Deyr rain in 2018, large-scale displacement and lack of access to basic services. There are no permanent water sources within the IDP settlements hence IDPs rely on berkards which have since dried up, and there is high pressure on the few existing boreholes, already suffering years of neglect and poor maintenance in Hobyo and Galkacyo districts. Pastoralists are highly vulnerable because they are dependent upon rain-fed rangeland grazing for their livestock and tend to have very few fixed assets. The project intends to provide durable and sustainable water and sanitation services to 22,705 IDP\u2019s and drought vulnerable people in Afgaduudle, Madaxdaran, Lascadalle, Tarogee, Qaidaro and Wisil villages by drilling 3 boreholes and rehabilitation of 3 strategic boreholes to provide sufficient safe water increasing access to at least 15 litters per day. The boreholes will be piped within a radius of 1150 meters. The project will also construct 60 latrines to improve sanitation conditions. Construction amp rehabilitation of reliable water sources to the IDP\u2019s and vulnerable host communities will reduce distance and time spent collecting water thus contribute to reduction of AWD for children and GBV among women and girls. WASH committees will also be established/revived/streamlined and trained to strengthen their capacity to manage the operation and maintenance of the new and rehabilitated boreholes and promote good hygiene practices and sanitation within their communities. 60 participants (30% are women) from NGO\u2019s, government and private sector will be selected in mutual collaboration with National and Regional WASH cluster will be trained on diagnostics of ageing boreholes and methods of rehabilitation through 2 workshops in Galkacyo and Mogadishu.",

SAHAN is a component of DFID\u2019s Somali Health and Nutrition (SHINE) programme. The aim under this programme is\nto identify and build a body of evidence for prototypes (interventions) demonstrated to increase access to and utilisation of reproductive, nutrition, child, and maternal health services and to promote healthy behaviour change. The program is using an adaptive, evidence-based, participatory approach to better understand the persistent barriers to uptake of health services and healthy behaviours and develop and test innovations in demand creation that target factors which influence individual behaviour to improve the health of Somali women of reproductive age (WRA) and children under-5. Using the socio-ecological model as a framework, these factors are understood to exist at and interplay between the individual, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy levels. Fundamentally this programme is re-envisioning how \u201cdemand creation\u201d is done, using cutting-edge methods.\n\nAt the end, this programme is intended to have developed evidence-based, user-informed and tested interventions to drive demand for health services (in both the public and private sectors) and/or change healthy behaviours of women and caregivers of children under-5, packaged and ready to be implemented at scale with clear recommendations for contextual adaptations. In parallel, the programme will have built local capacity to develop and implement innovative behaviour change interventions using human-centered approaches, strengthened the learning environment across the health sector through promoting information sharing and collaboration.",

Although there have been improvements to the peace and security situation in Somalia since the formation of the Federal Government of Somalia in 2012, the overall situation remains fragile with Al-Shabab a major obstacle to peace and security. Forced displacement remains an ongoing a reality for people living in Somalia due to armed conflict, environmental hardships due to climate change, combined with inadequate resource distribution that is often exacerbated by clan based, ideological differences and land and natural resources competition. The COVID-19 pandemic has added yet another hazard that people in Somalia face. While it has now been over a year since the first case was detected in Somalia and efforts have been made to mitigate the risk, the situation is always evolving. With the main objective to ensure dignified, safe and secure living conditions and basic services for vulnerable populations affected by conflict and disasters in Somalia, IOM proposes an integrated camp coordination and camp management, Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and shelter and non-food item emergency support.",

Cette d\u00e9marche nous permet par ailleurs d\u2019\u00e9valuer les progr\u00e8s accomplis par le biais d\u2019un simple cadre de performance des subventions. Celui-ci couvre l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du portefeuille de subventions pour chaque pays, afin d\u2019assurer le suivi des principales contributions et activit\u00e9s, mais aussi des r\u00e9sultats interm\u00e9diaires et effets escompt\u00e9s.

The pentavalent vaccine, administered in a three-dose schedule, offers protection against five diseases: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), heptatitis B and Haemophilius influenzae type b. Until 2013, GAVI has helped to introduce the pentavalent in 70 of the 73 GAVI-eligible countries, with the aim of reaching all 73 by the end of 2014.

To date, the country remains divided by various political and clan factions and strong anti-governement elements who are benefiting from the availability remnants or war (ERW) such as landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) thereby significantly weakening the overall stability and security in Somalia. This project seeks to reduce the impact of landmines, unsecured ammunition stockpiles, UXO and other ERW have at regional level. Phase one will target Northern Somalia (Somaliland) where large clearance efforts are coming to an end in the next three years and where, until clerarance is completed, accidents will continue to affect rural communities. HALO will deploy four manual clerance teams and one mechanical team to clear 616,000m2 from 1 Setember 2016 to 31 December 2018. Phase two will take place in Southern Somalia where government credibility has been gradualy increasing and where making concrete steps to restore stability can significantly foster state's legitimacy. International funding for HMA in Somalia is contributing to the multilateral effort to stabilise Southern Somalia by addressing factors leading Somali populations to migrate to Europe in search of better futures. HALO\u2019s work in Southern Somalia began in 2015, and a process of slow, steady development is being undertaken to minimize risks to the programme.",

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proj\nect's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinic?s personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three out\nputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Local health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

The core state functions are now recovering but the legitimacy and capacity of the state are still weak. Conflicts and violence remain a significant challenge. The prolonged confli\nct has resulted in porous air sea and land-border management providing a thriving conduit for Transnational organized immigration crimes. In order to improve security and strengthen state legitimacy the Federal Government of Somalia is aiming at strengthen\ning the capacity of the Immigration and Naturalisation Directorate IND in line with the National Development Plan. The project will focus on developing the institutional capacity of IND especially its HR Department in order to strengthen the legitimacy of \nthe Federal Government of Somalia in the field of immigration and border management. The project will utilize diaspora and international experts in developing capacity and strengthen IND?s infrastructural capabilities to deliver quality public services.   \nThe project will be implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) during a period of 14 months in 2020 - 2021. Finland supports the project with 1 000 000 euros.",
