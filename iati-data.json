        "description": "Global funding for the HIV response is in decline. The political will to end AIDS is receding as governments deal with multiple challenges including nationalism, populism, conflict and instability. These challenges contribute to increasingly polarised societies. However, globally there are still 38 million people living with HIV and in 2019 there were 1.7 million new infections.\n\nKey population groups (such as LGBTQI+ people, sex workers, people who use drugs) and their partners, and adolescent girls and young women are most affected by HIV, and account for the majority of new infections. Globally, the total number of new HIV infections has hardly declined for several years, stagnant at 1.7 million since 2018. This is far above the UNAIDS target of 500,000 per year by 2020 and reflects a worsening picture.\n\nIn 2019, for the first time, key population groups and their partners accounted for the majority (62%) of all new infections worldwide. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa, regions where the epidemic is expanding, key population groups accounted for almost all new infections.",

The main area of research and learning will be changes in access to services (access to health facilities in DRC and access to justice in Somalia) and how this contributes to conflict prevention and to inclusive peacebuilding processes. This pillar is managed from the UK. Please note: when funds are allocated to the UK this is to the general benefit of all IRC Programmes and the wider sector.",

The proposed project seeks to challenge harmful social norms including Female Genital Mutilation and Child Early and Forced Marriage and to increase womens social and economic empowerment through interventions at the individual, household, community and societal levels. Successful implementation of these interventions will result in reduction in harmful practices, increased value of women and girls and will contribute towards greater voice, choice and control for Somali women and girls over their bodies and futures (Project Impact). This will be achieved transforming social norms to support gender equality in Somalia (Outcome) through three key outcome areas: 1) Enhanced legal and policy environment for greater equality of women and girls; 2) Improved knowledge and attitudes of men, women, girls and boys on gender discriminatory social norms; and 3) Increased social and economic empowerment of women and girls. IRC will be working in Galkayo (South), Hobyo, Hawal-wadag, Karaan.",

Forthe other 50% the programme focuses on the specific needs and participation of young men. 2) It focuses both on the supply and the demand in the labourmarket, and tries to link enterprises and job-seeking youths. 3) And it aims to change policies and develop an enabling environment: advocacy for enabling policies and having role models advocate for youth participation in decision making and at the labour market.\nThe most important goal of \"Work in Progress!\" is to improve the skills of young people and their economic prospects by creating jobs and stimulating entrepreneurship. The three major outcomes are as followed: 1) More young men and women have found paid jobs or are running their own enterprises. By improving their employability skills, improvetheir access to information, to exchange platforms to link them to business, accelerators and incubators, and financial investments. 2) Local SMEs see business grow resulting in newly created positions for youth.

        "description": "Access to justice in Somaliland is a complex issue. Different justice systems work parallel to each other and the awareness of the population which route to justice to take is very low, particularly in rural areas. Government institutions and formal justice providers are primarily based in urban areas in Somaliland. Rural areas have therefore little to no access, making the informal system, Xeer, often the only one to deal with cases. This places women and youth in difficult situations as they do not form part of the elders group. Legal representation in the formal system is dire. Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs) also face considerable challenges including but not limited to social, economic legal problems, shelter, inaccessibility to land, property, security, health and education. Therefore, with the proposed action this consortium seeks to contribute to increased access to fair and effective justice in Somaliland that adequately deals with community members# grievances, in particular those faced by women, youth, IDPs and minorities",

To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue.

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly. A totalof 3.500 households will benefit from better information and a improved programming as a result.'",

Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships.

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly. A totalof 3.500 households will benefit from better information and a improved programming as a result.'",

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly. A totalof 3.500 households will benefit from better information and a improved programming as a result.'",

        "description": "# Solarization of two existing water sources   in Baki and Saylac districts of Awdal benefiting more than 10,000 people and their livestock. Awdal is one of the regions affected by COVID19 as it connects Somaliland to Djibouti. The majority of people are dependent pity trades, small scale irrigation, and livestock, most of these activities have been affected, and communities reported a reduction of income. Existing water supply sources are mainly powered by a diesel generator that are purchased from the tariffs collected from the users. Associated water tariffs are sky rocking as access to diesel has reduced as restrictions are imposed on public transport. Out of the many strategic water sources, two sources are selected, supplying water for villages affected by COVID19 in Somaliland. Oxfam will install a solar system for these wells, and the action will reduce the cost of water tariff and increase community use of water for different purposes include handwashing.\n# Build the capacity of the WASH committees managing the solarizedse water sources by providing necessary tools and training them on both technical skill and financial management. This action will be led by the ministry of water department of scheme management. As we mobilize for the two sources an additional two boreholes within the sameareas will also be invited for the training. These will help to maximize use of expert time, cover nearby villages with capacity building plan and increase value for money by targeting more with same budget.\n# Support Somaliland Ministry of Water Development to ministry of water to finalize   the design and construction for WASH facilities to be shared with all WASH Cluster members in Somaliland. The national WASH cluster has prioritized this action as per the request from ministry and Oxfam will contribute for this action. The budget will be used to cover some of the consultancy fees or provide expertise to help them finalize the work.\n# Provide safeprogramming training for WaSH committees, district administrations, women groups other key stakeholders including traditional leaders    .\n# Protection awareness raising including community discussions on protection impact to address stigma and promotion of the call centre hotline   (already operational) to increase access to covid19 services for affected communities    .\n# Government capacity building/strengthen social safety net system in Somaliland : we will build the capacity of the government to be able to lead and coordinate Somaliland safety net program. Somalia launched safety net project called bahnano at Mogadishu but this has not been cascaded to Somaliland and Puntland. The government staff responsible for this are unable to run safety net due to their limited capacity. The project will target technical staff from the government and create enabling environment in the form of institutional capacity building including training of key staff, support implementation of beneficiaries selection and running coordination mechanisms smoothly.  Oxfam Somalia is implementing social safety net activity under GFFO top up. Under this activity the project aims improving supports to HHs in urban areas particularly COVID19 affected poorest or most vulnerable to prevent them to fall to poverty and destitution trap, manage COVID19 economic and social shocks and advance their lives <(>&<)> livelihoods. The government capacity in Somaliland on social safety net is to grow and as part of appeal fund, Oxfam will contribute to strengthening/establishing social protection system that leads COVID19 response project. Oxfam will partner with Somaliland Ministry of Employment, Social and Family as socialprotection responsible government body. Somaliland government capacity is yet to grow and this project will address this gap while also coordinating with other implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to be able to lead social assistance and provide at scale in the future to its society as a right. The project creates an opportunity for governments to become the standard responders to large scale crises.",

The unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 30 is 67% - one of the highest rates in the world. Among young women, it is even estimated at 74%. Youth in Somaliland are not just the future ofthe country, they are also the majority.\nWith 67% of the youth being out of work, the high unemployment rate forthe youth remains abig challenge in Somaliland, and this rate is even higher for young women. The unemployment rate for young women in the country is estimated to be 74%. Due to the insecurity over the last two decade and stagnant economic growth, jobs have not been created at a rate that is able to match the growth of the youth population.\nWomen often face stiff competition during business pitching/competitions and often shy away to compete with their fellow men or observe stigmatization. This conceptwill bridge this gap by specifically earmarking this Women in Tech competition for young women tech savvies to compete among each other.\nTo achieve a long lasting and sustainable economic and social transformation in the country, we must empower young women, create opportunities for prosperity and provide them with the necessary tools and resources.\nHence Innovate Ventures (IV) in partnership and collaboration with Oxfam aim to support, accelerate and grow the Somali women startup scene and accelerate the growth of women startups in technology to help them create employment opportunities, and improve the investment climate in the country",

        "description": "Somalia, a fragile State that is emerging from decades of civil war, is currently experiencing an unprecedented situation mainly caused by climate change, Covid-19 and locust infestation, which exacerbated the long-term existed challenges within the country including widespread vulnerability and marginalization, insecurity and government with poor institutional capacity to deliver and advocate for basic humanitarian needs of local communities, combination of the above mentioned challenges contributed to negative socio-economic impact on Somali communities and resulted in the displacement of affected populations (mainly rural) and formation of IDP sites alongside main towns.\nOther challenges encountered by Somalia and Somaliland communities include lack of coping capacity to climate change and widespread dependency created by Humanitarian Aid due to the absence of government\u2019s role that affects the livelihood of entire communities rather than building their long-term resilience. It's evident that the Humanitarian Aid Dependency has largely affected the productivity of the Somali population. However, there's need to exhaust to what extent these will be addressed by our research questions for the Participatory Action Research (PAR) on Aid Humanitarian Aid dependency.\nIn 2019, nine Somali NGOs founded the Nexus platform that aims to shape the future in Somalia and Somaliland, by creating an enabling environment for Somali NGOs to have a leading role in the humanitarian system that puts the agency and self-reliance of communities at the center, through delivering a combination of Humanitarian Aid, Development, and Peace interventions. The Nexus coalition is led by nine Somali NGOs \u2013 African Development Solutions (ADESO), Centre for Peace and Democracy (CPD), Gargaar Relief and Development Organization (GREDO), Horn of Africa Voluntary Youth Committee (HAVOYOCO), KAALO, Save Somali Women and Children (SSWC), Social-Life and Agriculture Development Organisation (SADO), Taakulo Somaliland Community (TASCO), and WASDA. Two INGOs \u2013 Oxfam and Save the Children International were invited to join as international partners to support with critical investments.\nSo far the platform developed and applied its strategy andtheory of change whilst Humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, Somalia Nexus consortium aims to focus interventions that are in line with its pillars, including Community-driven and working across the Triple Nexusof Development, Humanitarian Aid, Peace-building and conflict-resolution, as well as strengthening the capacity of Somali Civil Society <(>&<)> Government institutions. In addition, special considerations will be given concerning practicality and implementation methodology including presence, scaleof the need, duration and coordination with other stakeholders.\nThe day-to-day activities of theplatform are performed by the Secretariat supported by the Steering committee who are also responsible for resource mobilization, organizing coordination meetings, fund management and drafting policies and guidelines\nIn 2021, the Nexus platform aims to implement efforts to support its members and government institutions in both Somalia and Somaliland, through development of Community-driven Development manuals, conducting Participatory Action Research that finds durable solutions on climate related challenges in both pastoral and agro-pastoral communities, conducting PAR that aims to address the level and scope of dependency created by Unconditional Cash disbursement to local rural communities as well as supporting Somalia and Somaliland governments to develop standardized Cash Transfer model with clear guidelines.\nSocial inclusion, protection and Covid-19 protocols will be maintained and mainstreamed in project interventions.",

        "description": "COVID19 disease has been identified in China and later declared as a global pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. In Somalia and Somaliland, the first case of the disease was reported in March 2020, and since then, the government authorities implemented measures including movement restrictions, banning all community gathering, closing schools and other religious facilities. Somalia has over three million internally displaced communities (OCHA, Somalia) and over 79% of Somalis are living either below or near the internationalpoverty line (NDP-9, Somalia). The majority of IDPs live in overcrowded settlements with weakened infrastructure, insufficient access to WASH facilities and inaccessible health services. Since later last year, the locust manifestation and floods destroyed majority posture and farmland deteriorating the already weakened communities.\nSomalia is one of the worst prepared countries in the world to contain the disease. WHO recommends the use of personal protective equipment, frequent handwashing and social distance to contain COVID19. Oxfam Somalia works with communities to promote these critical measures and raise awareness of communities on COVID19. Thissupport requires a close engagement with communities and health volunteers. However, since the first COVID19 case was declared in Somalia, we have limited our community contact and tried to see possible options to provide Real-time support to our communities. This included using a mobile-based application, Well Beyond, to provide COVID19 prevention and containment training. This trail was found to be effective and efficient. We are now proposing the scale up the same approach to expand to include other training including hygiene promotions, WASHCO training, WASH <(>&<)> Protection related training.\nCOVID19 has changed our traditional ways of living, working and our regular ways of implementing programs. For ownership and sustainability, it is critical to ensure communities' involvement in program design and implementation. In COVID19 environment, this can only be possible by using technologies to deliver training, information and collect feedback.\nWe wish to deploy critically needed information into the Oxfam Somalia regions of work through the Well Beyond App. This life-saving mobile technology sends interactive COVID-19 and Sanitation and Hygiene training material tothe community based health voluneteers. The technology will fill knowledge gap between COVID-19 recommendations and the tools and knowledge available in the remote, rural places. It serve by providing vital training material, guidance on handwashing stations, surface hygiene, sanitation and real-time chat support, and other tools to help communities prevent the spread of COVID-19. At the sametime, Oxfam Somalia will be able to track training completions and collect data on the solution\u2019s success. This will allow the Oxfam field team to continuously interact with our beneficiaries and community health volunteers.\n\nThe UN Economic Commission for Africaprojected more than hundreds of thousands of Africans could lose their lives due to COVID-19. The Somali government, in alignment with the WHO, emphasizes that basic, preventative measures by individuals and communities remain the most powerful tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but delivering this critical information has been a challenge, as the movement within countries is very limited, and social distancing guidelines prohibit large group trainings in person. The Well Beyond App will allow us to provide this crucial guidance to our CHVs and support to our communities, even though we aren\u2019t physically able to be there.",

Accountability is \u201cthe process of using power responsibly, taking account of, and being held accountable by different stakeholders, and primarily those who are affected by the exercise of such power\u201d . It is the right to be heard, and the duty to respond.\n\nHowever, anecdotal information indicates that where CBFCMs initiatives and experiences exist in Oxfam, many are still disjointed, some are uncoordinated, and largely undocumented. In many places, they are non-existent, or if they are, not all of them are fully functional. The design of Oxfam\u2019s CBFCMs by Affiliates, Country Offices and in part Partners has not always ensured community involvement, in most cases resulting in not fit for purpose mechanisms. Also different affiliates still approach the issue of CBFCMs differently with different emphasis, approaches, tools and resources, therefore lacking a standardised coordinated approach.\n\nAlthough Oxfam prides itself for encouraging communities we work with to speak out and report PSEA and child protection concerns and incidents concerning them,recent reports in some countries like DRC, Ethiopia, and Uganda not only attests to the limited awareness at community level on SEAand child protection risks and reporting mechanisms, but has also led to an increase in attention to ensure that SEA and child abuse and exploitation by humanitarian and development organisations like Oxfam are addressed through investment in preventive approaches but also responding to reports of abuse and exploitation when these incidents are reported.\nOxfam has two responsibilities for accountability in the programmes it manages, holding a responsibility for mutual accountability with its partners (as do the partners) and also holding a shared or joint accountability (with its partners) to the communities affected by its programmes.

        "description": "The eastern regions in Somaliland and especially Saanag and Sool regions continue to suffer from recurrent drought. This situation has increased the vulnerability of the communities as they have lost most of their livestock which was their main source oflivelihood. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two regions also continue to experience occasional inter clan fighting which isoften triggered by competition for available pasture and water resources. Drilling of the a boreholes will not only contribute to providing important water sources that can support the water needs of the communities during drought and harsh climatic conditions, but also contribute to reducing risk factors leading to conflict. It will offer an opportunity to the benefiting communities to have a chance for better access to potable water, reduce the incidents water related diseases and increase access for water for practicing frequent handwashing to prevent COVID-19.\nObjectives;\n\u2022 Provide sustainable water source for 5000 people and over 10,000 livestockheads in Sanaag Region.\nGroundwater Feasibility Study:\nA groundwater feasibility study will be conducted in three selected villagesof Sanaag region. the study will follow three approach method,\n1. Remote Sensing: Desk review using latest satellite imageries to selected best possible locations. This phase will focus on finding regional fractures carrying water from highland of Ethiopia to thelowland of Sanaag regions and from Sanaag mountains to low land areas.\n2. Geophysical Study: ground truthing work will be conducting using latest start of art geophysical technology at least three locations with spacing of 1000 -1500m. This location are those selected in first phase of the study work. Government and community engagement will be conducted to understand the local geology, possible impact of drilling on environment and stability of the communities.\nDrilling of the borehole\nBased on the groundwater feasibility study, the drilling work will be advertised through the local media. In order to avoid failures resulted from improper use of drilling equipment and selection of drilling method, the contractor will receive full copy of the study report and will be given a briefing on the drilling technology and technique recommended by the study team. Then, a payment by result approach will be used to contract drilling companies i.e. Oxfam/Taakulo will only pay if the borehole has water with discharge of above 2liter per second. Failureto get a contractor willing to commence drilling with such conduction, further meeting will be help between Oxfam and Taakulo to discuss best possible approach to increase value for money.\nSupervision and Monitoring:\nIn drilling works supervision and monitoring progress is critical step. Oxfam/Taakulo will have a site supervisor equipped with necessary materials for supervision including TDS Sensor to record water quality at each 1 meter, mud funnel to record the drilling mud viscosity and deeper to follow the depth of the drilling. The supervisor will provide daily update to both Oxfam/Taakulo team and will ensure all decision that affect drilling performance is consulted and agreed before action. TDS level will be recorded in monitoring tool provided and the result will be used for deciding the borehole casing arrangement. All materials that will be used for drilling will be inspected by the drilling supervisor and approve. In case a specialized chemical will be used for the drilling; the supervisor will request for all safety related certificate prior use of such chemicals.\nPost Drilling Construction:\nThis action will be decided right after the drilling is completed. Provision of submersible pump with cable and riser pipes, and construction of generator house, water distribution system for both animal and human and storage facilities will be included under this phase. Other grants, including ECHO 2021 and/or other internal grants will be used to finance this critical activity. Incase the borehole salinity is above an acceptable regional level i.e. 2500ppm, provision of desalination unit will be considered.",

To date, the country remains divided by various political and clan factions and strong anti-governement elements who are benefiting from the availability remnants or war (ERW) such as landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) thereby significantly weakening the overall stability and security in Somalia. This project seeks to reduce the impact of landmines, unsecured ammunition stockpiles, UXO and other ERW have at regional level. Phase one will target Northern Somalia (Somaliland) where large clearance efforts are coming to an end in the next three years and where, until clerarance is completed, accidents will continue to affect rural communities. HALO will deploy four manual clerance teams and one mechanical team to clear 616,000m2 from 1 Setember 2016 to 31 December 2018. Phase two will take place in Southern Somalia where government credibility has been gradualy increasing and where making concrete steps to restore stability can significantly foster state's legitimacy. International funding for HMA in Somalia is contributing to the multilateral effort to stabilise Southern Somalia by addressing factors leading Somali populations to migrate to Europe in search of better futures. HALO\u2019s work in Southern Somalia began in 2015, and a process of slow, steady development is being undertaken to minimize risks to the programme.",

        "description": "1. Early married/adolescent mothers/ adolescent girls who have dropped out: Low to no expectation that these girls will enroll or re-enroll in school. Girls themselves are reluctant to enroll/re-enroll they are embarrassed to enter school in a class with younger children. At mid line, 81% of caregivers stated age as an important deciding factor as to whether a child should attend school. Intensive accelerated learning classes will be key to enabling these girls to increase their learning level and to engage/re-engage with school amongst girls their own age. Nuanced messaging through BCC campaigns will raise the community support for girls of all ages to prioritize schooling. 2. Disabled girls: Low to no expectation that these girls will enrol in school. For those who are enrolled they are not expected to achieve at the same level as their peers. The teacher training module will be developed focusing on basic approaches to inclusive education, enabling teachers to better engage with disabled children in the classroom. Additionally, disabled girls will be targeted for bursary support. 3. IDPs, refugees, returnees Girls may have fled a conflict situation; violence and upheaval may have a negative impact on psychosocial wellbeing. Due to limited mobility, girls miss school and fall behind. These factors can lead to a general expectation, of the girl and her parents, that girls will not progress and succeed in school. Girls in these groups who are extremely poor will be identified for bursary support ensuring economic barriers do not prevent attendance. Additionally, psycho social support from trained teacher mentors will aid an increase in girls\u2019 well being. 4. Orphans, minorities and other girls from poor households Girls are often expected to leave school early, if they enrol at all, to look after siblings and contribute to family income, with school-going costs understandably a lower priority. Bursary support will help enable girls from poor households to attend school, despite the economic challenges they face. 5.Children of lower learning ability/demonstrating low performance in the classroom The percentage of caregivers stating that a child\u2019s ability should be an important factor determining whether a child should attend school reduced from 88% to 43%. Specifically designed messages promoted through BCC activities will increase community support for children of all abilities to attend school. Remedial classes will help those children keep up with the learning levels of their peers.",

As well as threatening species with extinction, IWT destroys vital ecosystems. IWT also fosters corruption, feeds insecurity, and undermines good governance and the rule of law. The UK government is committed to tackling illegal trade of wildlife products. Defra manages the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, which is a competitive grants scheme with the objective of tackling illegal wildlife trade and, in doing so, contributing to sustainable development in developing countries. Projects funded under the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund address one, or more, of the following themes: \u2022 Developing sustainable livelihoods to benefit people directly affected by IWT \u2022 Strengthening law enforcement \u2022 Ensuring effective legal frameworks \u2022 Reducing demand for IWT products Over \u00a323 million has been committed to 75 projects since the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund was established in 2013; five projects were awarded in 2014 (via applications to the Darwin Initiative), fourteen in 2015, fifteen in 2016, thirteen in 2017, fourteen in 2018 and in the latest round in 2019. This round of funding includes the following projects (details of which can be found at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/811381/iwt-project-list-2019.pdf)): IWT062, IWT063, IWT064, IWT065, IWT066, IWT067, IWT068, IWT069, IWT070, IWT071, IWT072, IWT073, IWT074, IWT075.",

        "description": "6.3 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance across Somalia and Somaliland, with 2.6 million internally displaced and an estimated 1 million displaced in nearby countries. Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises. Although specifically tackled in the Somali context here \u2013 climate shocks and conflict are global causes of ongoing humanitarian crises, making the Nexus Platform\u2019s approach pertinent to challenges at the triple nexus in parallel circumstances. Comprised of nine local NGOs (footprint 30m USD), Oxfam andSave the Children International and entirely locally led, the platform is operational across every region of Somalia and Somaliland. The platform is built upon principles of South-to-South learning and civil society strengthening, whereby expertise is openly exchanged between member organizations to build a consortium that is more than the sum of its parts. Humanitarian response is central tothe platform\u2019s nascent phase. The platform envisions both multisectoral humanitarian response and the development of an Anticipatory Response Mechanism \u2013 utilisingthe platform\u2019s breadth of local access to trigger pre-emptive early action. The platform urgently needs \u2013 and is invested in developing \u2013 a model for its humanitarian programme areas through a PoC process which will allow the platform to rethink conventional humanitarian approaches that are particularly open to question in contexts such as Somalia. The process used to develop this model will be additionally adapted for the development of the platform\u2019s ways of working in the development and peace spheres:whilst humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, programs exemplifying locally-led decision making are planned in community development, government and civil society strengthening, women\u2019s empowerment and other areas across the triple nexus and these will require their own guiding PoC processes.",

        "description": "In this part of the world where displacement and utmost poverty are prevalent with no properly\nfunctioning health systems, it is hard to imagine how adversely impactful a COVID-19 outbreak will be.\nPeople are already extremely vulnerable to bear yet another distressing crisis. While all countries need to\nrespond to COVID-19, countries with existing humanitarian crisis coupled with weak governance are\nparticularly vulnerable. When COVID-19 affects countries with protracted humanitarian crises like\nSomalia/land, vulnerable populations, particularly women headed households, the disabled and the\nelderly living in overcrowded camps or informal urban settlements will be highly vulnerable to the disease\nand its social and economic impacts unless support is given on preventative measures.The number of\npeople in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia, around 5.2 million currently, will likely sharply\nincrease in the event of COVID-19 outbreak making the already fragile situation much worse. The Locust\ninfestation is another evolving crisis andif not addressed will also have significant impact on the food\nsecurity and livelihoods of the people.\nCOVID-19 crisis will have a different and far-reaching impact on poor people, especially the vulnerable.\nAnyone can be exposed to the virus but the poor are most vulnerable as they lack financial and social\nprotections. Overcrowded IDP settlements and poor urban slums are also going to be the places where\ndisease can spread easily and quickly. To effectively address the urgent and acute humanitarian dimension\nof the crisis, we need to frame that within our understanding of how inequality plays out. Women will be\nas susceptible to getting infected by the virus but their need for support is greater because, as in any crisis,\nwomen including elderly women, bear the greater responsibility of caring for the family and making both\nends meet. Women#s multiple burdens of needing to contribute to the household income while also taking\ncare of the young, theelderly and the sick mean they have the longest days, the shortest rest and the\nhighest stress, making them easy targets of disease.\nContainment measures and their economic fallout are likely to hurt more than the disease itself, and for\nlonger. Restrictions on movement and market access will affect many households# income and coping\nstrategies in Somalia/land, including households who were relatively well off before the pandemic. As well\nas short term support we need to consider howto provide support to those affected over the longer term.",

        "description": "This project addresses the need for locally trained female teachers and teaching assistants in Galgaduud region of Somalia, which until seven years ago had no tradition of education. This organisation has already opened eight schools and runs four literacy campaigns, but the difficulties of recruiting and retaining teachers are immense. There are very few trained teachers from the area, and teachers brought in from elsewhere tend to stay for only short periods, and are exclusively male. There is a severe shortage of trained teachers in Somalia, and very few women have had the opportunity to train up to a professional standard. This particular project provides teacher training through a two year certificate course run by a local university but based in schools. This means female student teachers can live at home, making accessing the training easier. Because they are drawn from the local area, they are less likely to leave the region. The impact will be long term and educationally significant.",

        "description": "In Puntland pastoralism, fishing and trading, are the three main economic activities. They are highly complementary and interdependent, and constitute the basis of the present economy. However, poverty rate in Somalia is amongst the highest in the world. It affects 60% of the population in urban households and over 95% of the population in rural households. \nPuntland is host to an estimated 149,000 IDPs, refugees and asylum seekers and insecurity is the major cause of displacement, followed by drought and the lack of livelihood opportunities. Access to land and water continue to be the primary challenges for host communities and IDP, as well as forced relocation for IDP. Limited livelihoods make it difficult for Somalis to cope with environmental or political shocks. For children, Somalia has been characterized as one of the most challenging countries to grow up in. Only 29% of the children in Somalia attend primary school, and only 7% of the secondary school-age population attends secondary school. Poverty is one of the main reasons why children are sent out to work instead of going to school. In addition, about 33% of girls compared to 21% of boys had to work at home instead of attending school.\nThe partner, Forum for African Women Educationists &ndash; Somalia Chapter (FAWESOM), will implement the project in Dangorayo District, Nugaal Region, Puntland Stateand will work in;\nDecent Work: Collection of data and development of Somalia country profiles for decent work in fragile contexts; Advocacy on development of coherent labour laws;&nbsp; Advocacy for guidelines on abolishment of child labour; Training and advocacy on establishment of cooperatives and unions. \nWomen Economic Empowerment: Mapping of market needs and opportunities for women; Value chain analysis and private sector development for increased employment opportunities, specifically targeting women; Support to income generating activities, in particular targeting women, youth and IDPs; Entrepreneurship support, in particular for women and youth\nThe actors with the most significant impact on the programme and also those that will be most affected by the programme, include right holders (women, men, youth, IDP and other marginalized groups) CSOs, government bodies, private sector, religious and traditional leaders, local businesses/private sector.",

        "description": "In summary, this project proposes to contribute to three core aspects of Camp Coordination and Camp Management in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District, including leading essential coordination functions, developing and maintaining camp infrastructures that have been devastated by recent flooding.establishing/Rehabilitating/Enhancing drainage systems in IDP sites through incentivized workdays carried out by site-level site maintenance committees, and promoting humanitarian accountability through the operation of feedback and complaint mechanisms. Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money.

        "description": "Displacement, cramped living conditions and other related stressors following flooding all serve to exacerbate tensions and increase violence in the home and in communities, with women and girls most at risk. With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries. Approximately 50 (20 girls and women) will be engaged in GBV safety audit and action planning in their communities. 4,000 (1,220girls,1,260 women, 800 boys and 720 men) will be reached through door to door community outreach and over 25,000 reached through GBV radio advocacy and awareness creation. 450 dignity kits and 250 emergency support kits and 2000 sanitary kits will be distributed. Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management. Through the two WGSS, a total of 800(400 women and girls) will be reached through weekly GBV prevention and response sessions.",

        "description": "In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region. There were more than 5 accidents with fatalities and casualties in the Danyiile district alone this year which includes children and persons with no knowledge of Explosive ordinances.\n\nIn Afgooye about 191,143 persons standing as 100% of the population severity level no 3 described as degrading which puts them highly in need of protection against the explosive substances. Of these 56,000 are IDPs from the floods and other natural calamities while 135,431 are host communities according to the data recently shared by the protection cluster on HNO.\n\nExplosive ordinances contamination presents a barrier to development, and encumber livelihood activities particularly it affected IDPs, returnees, animal herders, and the rural poor families.",

These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.     Increased availability of legal services for post flood HLP issues.\n\nNoFYL is currently an SPMS partner leading data collections in Kismayo, Afgoye and Mogadishu (Deynille amp Kaxda districts).",

In order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in the affected areas and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called 'Kobo Tool box' to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with 'Do No Harm' principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $145 (80% or $116 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $29 as the second installment) per HH will be provided for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . A predetermined beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . These criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use M and E tools that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. This action shall deliver urgent humanitarian flood response assistance in the form of cash for NFIs and ESKs to 1,350 HHs (8,100 individuals) in district Belet Weyne.\n\nTo ensure that the assistance provided is used for intended purposes, NRC s will coordinate all components of this action with the community to ensure thorough sensitization and beneficiary participation  for individuals and the community at large .A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash and while also assess the impact of the response, generate and document lessons learned for dissemination to multiple stakeholders.",

The villages are home to pastoralists and agrarian communities.  Other villages that are affected by the floods include Athale, Haji Ali, Mahaday, Sabuni, Congo, Grasweyn and Adow uul. According to OCHA updates 1 on Deyr Season Floods Update, as of 4 November 2020, the flood in Jowhar affected 27,364 person living in Jowhar .The update also reported that on 3rd and 4th November 2020, flash floods cut the road linking Jowhar to Mogadishu at a location 10 km south of Jowhar.  The floods also affected the road to the airport. On 12th and 13th October 2020, heavy rains triggered flash floods in the riverine villages affecting about 3,600 people.  The Jowhar authorities reported that two children drowned as the result of the flash floods.The floods caused various impact to the WASH facilities the findings indicate that only less than 10% of the total affected population have access to safe water drinking water. Most of the infrastructure such as latrines have submerged and destroyed as the result of the floods. Sanitation is a serious issue due to the inadequate number of latrines in comparison to the population in need and many people are practice open defecation due to lack of sufficient latrines against the population. Lack of adequate and safe sanitation puts women, girls and at risk of physical violence and sexual assault as they relieve themselves in the open field.The water have been contaminated and not fit for human consumption leading to potential outbreaks of water-borne diseases and acute water diarrhea.Therefore, in order to fill the gaps Islamic relief Somalia with funding from OCHA is planning to fill the gaps by rehabilitating of 5 shallow wells, two 2 boreholes and construction of 200 flood latrines.The project aims to tackle the effects emanating from the floods by providing emergency WASH services in Jowhar district, Somalia. The intervention is in line with the WASH strategy. It will also link to recovery and resilience building of the communities by rehabilitating WASH infrastructure that will assist 16,500 direct beneficiaries affected by Hagaa floods in Jowhar .The project will install solar power systems to the two (02) boreholes that are to be  rehabilitated  in jowhar depending on the needs while the rehabilitation of five (05) shallow wells will be undertaken at Mahaday,gumeysta,congo,marerey and cali warabey. The shallow wells will be rehabilitated, protected and upgrading including the installation of Two (2) boreholes that will be rehabilitated will be connected to water piping system including construction of four (4) water kiosk from the main borehole, gender balanced water management committees will be formed and trained. Islamic Relief Somalia will provide emergency water trucking to 4,000 beneficiaries in the rural areas of Jowhar district Each beneficiary will receive water in accordance with sphere standard of (7.5 liters/ per person per day). Water through tricks will be delivered on daily through blanket system which ensured beneficiaries know the quantity and where water should be collected.The displaced population in Jowhar are at risk of contracting malaria, acute bloody or watery diarrhoea, measles and other sanitation related diseases, The project will construct 200 emergency pit latrines to reduce AWD cases and improve the sanitation services. The latrines will be designed in line with the protection guidelines and segregated according to the sex. 20 latrines will be designed to meet the special requirements of people with disability.The project will construct and install 10 COVID-19 hand washing stations in order to  prevent COVID-19.The IDPs and the host communities will benefit from hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and production of IEC materials.1500 HHs will receive hygiene kits.",

Moreover, the use of radio media will look to provide an additional layer of awareness and critical thinking related to community-based responses and prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society, and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites. AVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster\u2019s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster\u2019s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster\u2019s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group. SCC (separate proposal): Through joint collaboration, SCC will be working WASH partners to organize hygiene promotion activities supported by CCCM partners via mobilizing community members and certain targeted members of the IDP sites. When feasible, WASH partners will provide emergency WASH services to IDP sites (water supply, hygiene promotion-installation, of handwashing stations, and distribution of soap for handwashing to sites that do not have access to these services.

        "description": "According to OCHA flash floods report Since July, up to 166,379 people have been affected by flash floods in Afgooye, Marka and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle region when riverbanks broke along River Shabelle. The floods have displaced in Wanlaweyn alone more than 82,000 people, inundated homes, wells and schools and destroyed large swathes of farmland and crops The heavy deyr rains ave caused massive population displacement, damaged housing, property, infrastructure and farm lands in riverine areas in southern Somalia. WASH Cluster has reported critical gaps in Balcad, Marka and Wanlaweyn where no WASH assistance has been received despite high risk levels for AWD.\nThe main aim of this project is to provide lifesaving WASH services to most vulnerable and underserved communities living in floods affected areas in Wanlaweyn district of Lower Shabelle Region. A total of 17,000 flood affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally throughout the project period.\n\nSOYDA in collaboration with the local authority, partnership with main water vendors in rural villages in Wanlaweyn district, will provide emergency water voucher to the 6,400 (1408 men, 1,536 women, 1,728 boys and 1,728 girls) targeted beneficiaries including people with disabilities and marginalized communities in the targeted IDP camps, which they can redeem for water at the specified water vendors (water trucks). The action also includes to hire water truck of a capacity of 6,000 liters of safe water to the targeted locations. Each voucher can be used to redeem specified quantity of safe water of 7.5 liters per person per day for a period of 30 days. The project will build the capacity of 1q WASH Committees (composing 4 men and 3 women per Committee) shared equally men and women on operation and maintenance of developed water infrastructures shall be throughout the project implementation period, to ensure the sustainability of the developed water facilities after the project is faced out. SOYDA will make sure that men, women, girls and boys including people with disabilities and marginalized community have equal access to the rehabilitated/constructed WASH services. SOYDA will upgrade/rehabilitate two boreholes equipped with hybrid to improve its water quality and reduce its running cost, in order to receive the community their water needs at an affordable cost. SOYDA will replace the engine powered boreholes in to hybrid system and construct 8 water kiosks nearer to the IDP settlements supplied water through piping network to avoid the risk of rape against women and girls in Wanlaweyn district. The project will provide reliable and sustainable access to environmental sanitation through construction of 100 IDP latrines in Wanlaweyn district. The latrines will be gender separated and flood proof with lockable doors and hand washing basins. construction of latrines will be implemented through market-based programming. \n\nSOYDA will distribute 80 sanitation sets to 10 IDP camps, in order to improve the environmental sanitation of the targeted locations. The aim of the sanitation sets distribution is to carry out clean-up campaigns, in order to reduce the spread of AWD/cholera diseases and to improve the environmental sanitation of the target locations. SOYDA will conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns focusing hand washing with soap practices to 17,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, health facilities, and nutrition centers. SOYDA will also train 30 Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) shared equally men and women, selected from the target communities and IDPs, so that in their turn they can educate the entire population to change their behaviors. 1600 HP kits will be distributed to the most vulnerable and underserved communities in the target locations",

The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

        "description": "Merka communities face scarcity of safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods coupled with the effect of pandemic since march 2020. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management.

        "description": "The proposed integrated response aims to respond to the urgent needs of IDPs in Kaxda and Deynille through the implementation of Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM), WASH, Protection and Shelter/NFIs activities. NoFYL will implement a multi-cluster intervention around Protection and CCCM aiming at strengthening coordination structures, improving the coordination, community-led site maintenance activities to ensure the upkeep of sites, support governance structures to ensure community participation and self-management of sites and information management at a site level, sites improvement activities to minimize protection risks and ensure safety in sites. \nOn protection, the intervention is geared toward preventing and responding to eviction, monitoring of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant clusters to mobilize support for advocacy. The advocacy and campaigns will aim to ensure actors facilitate lawful eviction processes. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, local authorities on Housing, Land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). WASH intervention will be complemented by PAH through the distribution of complete kits of hygiene, capacity building of water committees and community hygiene promotion through community outreach and awareness campaigns, addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs. ESNFI intervention will be complemented by HINNA by improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and emergency shelter kits.\n\nAt the initial stages of project implementation, the partners will organize an inception meeting with different actors with the support of the relevant cluster Coordinators. Rapid service mapping of actors will also be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervention areas and avoid duplication. NoFYL field teams shall actively participate in coordination mechanisms in Kaxda and Deynille to ensure other actors are updated on NoFYL plans in targeted districts to avoid overlap. This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI, CCCM, Protection, and WASH support and complement activities undertaken under other ongoing projects. NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation. The synergy between the 3 sectoral partners will ensure sound management of the program, greater impact, efficiency, and more cost-effective operations.

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

        "description": "Evictions represent a unique protection challenge in Somalia with far-reaching consequences on physical security, dignity, and livelihood of victims. Bossosa is one of the epicenters of the problem as the region struggles to recover from the residual effects of the 2016-17 drought amid persistent insecurity, cyclic natural disasters, and widespread unlawful evictions. At the national level, Somalia is faced with the daunting prospect of rebuilding the country having been riven by more than two decades of conflict and lawlessness. Important strides are being made to address the issue but ongoing initiatives have been outmatched due to the prevalence of the problem, thus necessitating a more robust, integrated and coordinated program response. In the absence of an effective response to address protection challenges that are being exacerbated by eviction, displaced communities will remain at risk of continuing secondary displacements. Efforts to strengthen protection and contribute to durable solutions to displacement in Bossaso will be incomplete and/or undermined without addressing the issue of eviction concurrently and systematically. The project seeks to contribute towards ensuring that individuals affected by displacement receive support assistance to improve their tenure security situation and address post-eviction complications.\n\nThis action builds on NRC\u2019s hands on expertise in evictions prevention and response programming in Somalia, and targeting 37,198 individuals in Bossaso, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced communities at risk of eviction and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of log lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities aimed at reducing the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthening tenure security among displaced communities at highest risk of eviction, and consolidating the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include supporting the establishment of dedicated evictions prevention capacities at the municipality of Bossaso, replicating eviction programming best practices at the municipality, helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash, and strengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities. A parallel objective of the HLP Sub Cluster which this project will seek to advance is consolidating HLP capacity among national organization.\n\nA combination of deliverables will contribute toward the mitigation of protection risks exacerbated by evictions through integrated prevention and response initiatives ensuring that displaced communities have increased access to information and specialized services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights and supporting local mechanisms to address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion.",

To achieve this overarching goal, lifesaving response to most vulnerable communities living in underserved and hard to reach areas in Xudur district. Protection services are combined with tangible assistance packages to assist displacement affected communities to develop resilient capacities necessary to address protection issues affecting women and children. Implementation will follow a linear integration approach where NRC will work in close collaboration with other partners to complement broader humanitarian objectives in Xudur. Specific priorities include strengthening community protection mechanisms to create an overall enabling protective environment, informing humanitarian interventions through periodic protection analysis, fostering peaceful co-existence through dialogues, providing direct emergency protection assistance to persons in need, contributing to improved referral systems, facilitating physical and material safety through the distribution of dignity kits, solar lanterns and the rehabilitation of solar street lights in high-risk areas. A total of 15,428 individuals are targeted across the 18 IDP sites in Xudur.\n\nLocal authorities estimate that there are about 5,000 IDP HHs in Xudur, majority of whom arrived as result 2016-17 droughts and ongoing conflicts. According to joint assessments conducted by NRC, AVORD and NRC in March 2020, the humanitarian situation in Xudur is dire and require immediate attention. Generally, Xudur faces serious humanitarian challenges as the district cannot be easily accessed by humanitarian actors safe for a small radius of about 25kms from the main town. Al Shabaab operations remain high and the security situation is in unpredictable. The already congested IDP sites are receiving new influx on daily basis burdening the already fragile. Water, Protection, Shelter and security issues were the greatest needs among the IDPs and displacement affected communities. Almost 80% of the IDPs have lost their assets as well as means of livelihood such as farming and livestock and are unwilling to return their places of origins. Water supply and sanitation services are needed, only 1/3 of the population have access to the already overwhelmed sanitation services, while over 70% of go out for open deifications. Hygiene essentials and practices are absent. It is within this context that the current project was conceptualized.",

As elaborated in the attached teaming agreement, AVORD will take lead in the provision of Non-Food Items, emergency shelters and CCCM services in Xudur while DRC and NRC will undertake complementary WASH and Protection activities respectively. Tentative implementation arrangements have been endorsed by the three agencies with a commitment to coordinate closely and target a similar target group, hence maximizing impact and efficiency of this response.\n\nUnder the present proposal, AVORD will distribute NFIs on-Food Items (NFIs) to 4,700 IDP and host community households (estimated 28,200 persons) who live in extremely poor shelter conditions. The target group include 6,768 men, 9,024 women, 3,384 boys and 3,384 girls from the IDP community and 1,692 men, 2,256 women, 846 boys and 846 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 846 men, 1,128 women, 423 boys and 423 girls will be targeted based on disability. Each registered household will be provided with 1 NFI kit comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Lamp and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for 250 newly arrived IDPs and those living in the open. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years. The number of emergency shelters to be constructed under this project has been limited to 250 since the majority of IDPs reside in private land, making it difficult to secure enough space for the construction of a large number of shelters. However, it is anticipated that IDPs will be able to use the plastic sheets that will provided as part of the NFI kit to repair damages to their current shelters.\n\nWith regards to CCCM, AVORD will setup and strengthen camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and trigger system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of 2 culturally-appropriate multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping, site monitoring and safety audits will be undertaken in close coordination with NRC, DRC, the CCCM cluster and other humanitarian partners in the area to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. Site maintenance committees in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out.\n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with a clear criterion to prioritize the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. The effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain critical relief items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Where market conditions allow based on survey data, AVORD will adapt a Cash-based approach to implementation otherwise, an in-kind, direct distribution modality will be adapted. Disbursement of relief items will be made in close coordination with the shelter cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In each distribution, priority will be given to most vulnerable households in humanitarian emergency including the disabled, the chronically-ill, female headed households and families with the largest number of children under the age of 5. Full beneficiary details such as contact information will be captured throughout the process to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. Within 4 to 8 weeks of each distribution, a Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in the region and with other humanitarian partners including NRC and DRC with whom AVORD has signed a memorandum of cooperation, to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

They will be distributed to newly arrived IDPs, protracted IDPs and affected host who did not receive any assistance in 2019 or early 2020 and mainly affected by flood. The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) living in the IDP site reside in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that jeopardize their physical security, privacy, and from vagaries of nature and diseases. \n\nUnder this project, HAPEN will distribute 3954 NFIs and 3954 ESKs as in-kind to 9 IDP site in Gedo region Dollow: (Kabasa = 655, Qansahley = 550, Host 100), Luuq: Jazeera =314, Xero kowad= 470 and Boyle=420 Host =100), and Garbahrey: (Towfiq =270, Tula qorah =345, Hashi Weer =380, Tafta taag =250 and Host 100).\n\nBeneficiaries will be selected through a participatory process driven by a representative project and site management committees while ensuring marginalized groups interests are catered for and vulnerable approach, considering issues such as women-headed and child-headed households, orphans, disabled, the old among and new arrivals, protracted, and distribution.\n\nThe proposed intervention targets 3654 IDP HHs (21,924 IDP persons) and 300 IDP host HHs (1,800) in Dollow, Garbaharey and Luuq. The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. \n\nFollowing a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs. HAPEN will employ an owner-driven approach in the construction of emergency shelters by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process.\n\nProtection and GBV concerns will be factored during site selection and will be integrated in all aspects of the response. Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.\n\nOn monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. \n\nThe PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. \n\n3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM. COVID-19 preventative mechanisms will be adopted in CRFM and during distribution to minimize any occurrence of infections.\n\nThe desks will be manned by two personnel and the anticipated data to be collected include among others both compliments and complaints: the quality of the ESKs and NFIs, beneficiary selection processes, shortness of items distributed, delays and other unexpected feedback.

        "description": "This project is intended to address the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 persons) of newly conflict and flood affected population as well as the most vulnerable protracted IDP families for life-saving in both districts \u2013 Afgoye and Marka \u2013 Lower Shabelle region.  With the presence of the Somali National Army (SNA) and AMISOM, Al Shabab, and clan militia, the security situation in the region had become more volatile than it was before. Security operations carry out by SNA and AMISOM alongside the USA drone airstrike targeting Alshabaab Militia caused humanitarian consequences to the civilians in the region. Within March 2020, joint forces SNA/AMISOM took over Janale village as a strategic business center it is about 13KM to Marka district. As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. \nThus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need \u2013 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.\nAlthough markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. \nDuring the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it's quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.\nThe main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)).

        "description": "IDP communities in Bardera face cyclical scarcity to safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Bardera. During the most recent floods in October 2019, 90 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Bardera IDP communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. \n\nACTED will respond to this compounded risk by implementing a market-based project in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Bardera, including Bulo Ceesan, Bulo Garass, Liban, Xabalcadey, Horseed and Kulmiya IDP sites, and will serve 2634 households (15804 individuals). To ensure the sustainability of this action, ACTED will collaborate with the private sector to extend existing water networks to these communities and where necessary construct new water assets. Moreover, ACTED will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable IDP communities, whilst establishing relationships with the private sector for continued maintenance and operation of these assets.",

The project is framed around four sector areas, Shelter, WASH, Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) and Protection. NRC will intervene in the WASH sector, DRC in Protection sector while AVORD in Shelter and CCCM sectors to complement each other's activities. The project will be targeting the same locations and beneficiaries in various settlements in Xudur district.\n\n A pre-teaming agreement has been uploaded/attached to this proposal (see attached Annex-1) providing further details on the approach and rationale of the collaboration. In essence, the multi-cluster, multi-sector and multi-agency approach, will maximize assistance as different sectors and actors will be able to share critical information and inform immediate programming and re-design of programs. This approach will be useful to create synergies of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact. The interventions will support the targeted communities holistically and efficiently by providing well-tailored and packaged responses to address different needs of the people of concern. The integrated response is in line with SHF principles by prioritization direct implementation and supporting the integration of response across clusters. \n\n10 settlements will be targeted by all agencies (the name of these settlements are mentioned in attached Annex-3) and will reach 17,131 individuals (50% females) through WASH interventions that includes rehabilitation of existing productive shallow wells and installing them with complete Solar pumping system, construction of water storage facilities and distribution points. The project will improve sanitation and hygiene conditions of the target communities through construction of 450 family shared latrines with handwashing facilities, training of community based hygiene promoters to undertake awareness creation along with distribution of 1350 hygiene kits to displacement affected families. DRC will provide Protection assistance whereby AVORD will provide Shelter and CCCM assistance to the same beneficiaries. After the approval of the project, NRC and DRC will do joint needs assessment both in the district to select the most vulnerable settlements for interventions. Through this project, NRC will reach 17,131 individuals. Post Distribution, Monitoring (PDM) and post construction exercises will be carried out after 6 weeks of wash NFIs and construction of latrines to analyse the impact of the project.",

The response will provide comprehensive WASH services in  Eyl district, saving lives by meeting Sphere standards/Somalia WASH Cluster Strategic Operational Framework through gender-sensitive services, contributing to overall health and disease prevention of IDP and rural communities. The project targets floods, cyclone and conflict affected populations (Internally displaced persons, Pastoralists communities and host communities.)  The project is designed to meet the needs of PAWAN cyclone affected populations in Eyl district of Nugaal region, Puntland Somalia. The project aims to reach 15,000 (3,000men, 3,750 women, 3,750 boys and 4,500 girls)\nThe WASH response will reduce health risks through hygiene promotion campaigns in communities while using participatory approaches. Responses will prioritize needs of women, girls and vulnerable people, include environmental safeguards to prevent degradation from humanitarian operations and afford affected people dignity and choice through Cash and Vouchers Assistance (CVA). A total 1500 women and girls will be supported through restricted CVA for hygiene/dignity items ensuring that women and girls can access preferred items for MHM and incontinence. Gender-segregated latrines (120 with locks and hand washing facilities) will be constructed and will include units accessible for people with disabilities limiting open defecation. Immediate water access will be ensured through durable solutions such as rehabilitation  and  construction and expansion of 2 water supply and improved subsurface dams/ 5 berkards are put in place. Gender-balanced WASH committees(2) will be supported to maintain facilities. In regard t improving protection environment of vulnerable groups 885 solar lamps will be distributed to enhance access to facilities\nDelivery of services will  further prioritize inclusion, participation of and accountability to affected populations. Integrated response will provide holistic aid that can respond rapidly to emerging needs, and this multi-year response will increase communities\u2019 resilience to future shocks. The project will strengthen capacities through training of water committees, hygiene promoters and general hygiene awareness campaigns including environmental sanitation to influence behaviour change and achieve adoption of appropriate hygiene and sanitation practices. \nThe project will make deliberate effort to maintain a protective environment throughout its interventions so that girls and women in particular are not exposed to harm such as sexual and gender-based violence while accessing WASH services. Further, gender equity will be observed while implementing all project activities. Men, women, Boys and Girls will be treated equally with their different needs being targeted and support provided accordingly. Women will be fronted to participate in decision making structures like the community WASH committees where they will be involved in project monitoring efforts.\nNCA will work closely with the existing local administration and community structures such as religious leaders, clan and community elders, minorities\u2019 women group and youth networks, men, women, girls and boys from IDPs community to accommodate the most vulnerable communities and will ensure inclusiveness, accountability and transparency.",

        "description": "In Lower Juba region and across Somalia, there are multiple threats to the health and resilience of the population due to inadequate WASH facilities. For water supply, Afmadow population is dependent on a mix of unprotected surface water sources and protected groundwater sources. Surface water sources are seasonal and usually contaminated, while protected groundwater supplies are either difficult to access to due to distance and/or not affordable due the high costs of extraction and the dominance of private sector entrepreneurs in their operation, often resulting in rates that the lower income communities cannot afford to access a minimum quantity of water per person per day (Sphere).\nIn this context, ARC will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1) Rehabilitation and/or extension of 5 existing water infrastructures to provide reliable and sustained access to safe water based on identified strategic community water points to flood affected communities in Afmadow district. (2) Establishment of 5 gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women participation in WASH projects. (3) Installation of new and/or rehabilitation of 600 sanitation facilities that are lockable from inside, gender segregated, with hand washing facilities, disaster sensitive with appropriate disaster mitigation features designs. As part of ensuring protection mainstreaming, ARC will install solar light near communal sanitation facilities or if this is not feasible will provide with individual household\u2019s solar lamp/torch. (4) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution to enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness and enable good practices. Significant amount of the above proposed WASH activities will be implemented through Market Based Programming (MBP) approach as to strengthen local markets. \n The proposed WASH project will complement set of emergency Health, Protection and livelihood interventions currently ongoing in the targeted areas of Afmadow district through other funding to ensure a comprehensive approach to reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with diseases and hazards resulting from deficient sanitation conditions, the lack of access to safe water and low level of good hygiene practices. ARC\u2019s WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. Approximately 24,000 people (4,000 households) will benefit from this intervention. All ARC WASH programs are community led, and leverage stakeholder cooperation to ensure safe, equitable, and dignified access to WASH services for all. Under Health sector, ARC is supporting one MCH (Bosnia) in Dhobley and would start Outreach health services in Afmadow town targeting IDP sites with vulnerable individuals having difficult access to basic lifesaving health services. ARC would also provide un-conditional cash transfer to vulnerable groups in Dhobley for 3 months aiming to improve food security situation as well as the nutrition indicators. ARC\u2019s integrated approach combining the WASH intervention with health and nutrition components ensures greater impact in the area of operation. Adequate WASH improves the overall public health indicators, including the lower incidence of communicable diseases, reduced mother and child morbidity and stronger effects of nutrition interventions as a result of prevention of loss of valuable nutrients from diarrheal diseases.",

PAH, NoFYL and HINNA will implement a multi cluster intervention aiming at 1) CCCM: improving the coordination and information management at site level 2) WASH: addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs in this field 3) PROTECTION: mainstreaming protection through (a) preventing and response to eviction, including monitoring threats of evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant cluster to mobilize support for advocacy (b) To advocacy and campaigns that aim to ensure lawful eviction processes (c) Capacity development of settlement managers, local authorities in the field of housing, land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). 4) SHELTER: improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and construction of Transitional shelters.\nActivities will be implemented by PAH, NoFYL and HINNA in 2 districts (Kaxda and Deynile) of Banadir region. Activities will target the most undeserved areas of these districts that host mostly newly displaced IDPs due to drought and conflicts. Approximately 17,400 people (3,283 men, 6505 Boys, 9,710 girls and 4,886 women) including 3658 people with disability will directly benefit from this intervention. It will also benefit an entire community working in targeted IDP sites, including local authorities, clusters and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach and synergies enable the partners to concentrate services and expertise within the same location and same population, leading to a greater impact.\n\nMoreover, PAH acts as WASH Cluster co-lead at national cluster level, NoFYL is part of SRCs and member of CCCM and protection cluster, while HINNA is a member of shelter cluster in Banadir region. This allows to ensure a great capacity for project implementation and a strong understanding of the cluster strategy. Each partner will directly implement activities of their specialization sector. The coordination among partners will be done throughout an entire implementation process to ensure synergies and combine services delivery for all sectors. The partners will jointly conduct periodic monitoring activities to assess implementation of the project, collect feedback from beneficiaries and adjust implementation accordingly if needed. This will be done through harmonized tools that will be developed during the project kick-off meeting. Furthermore, NoFYL, while  providing protection services to IDPs, will also ensure that protection is mainstreamed throughout WASH activities conducted by PAH  as well as Shelter activities conducted by HINNA,  by providing relevant training and ensuring strong coordination.",

        "title": "Fighting TB in Somalia: public-private partnerships and inclusive communities",
        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB)  especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: d\nisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat  fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is th\ne low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case detect\nion rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and prisone\nrs)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of Soma\nliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of tu\nberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease stigm\na/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tubercul\nosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Cares Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results show\n that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health care\n for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that \neventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneousl\ny invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the \ntelephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proje\nct's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinics personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

Luglio 2019 ha segnato il livello pi\u00f9 basso di raccolti agricoli a partire dal 1995, il 70 sotto la media, con conseguenze umanitarie disastrose sulla popolazione. Le abbondanti piogge dell'ultimo mese hanno tuttavia provocato inondazioni nelle aree agricole, distruggendo sia gli insediamenti umani sia la produzione agricola Inoltre la mancanza di strutture igienico sanitarie di base ha causato il diffondersi del colera, della malaria e di altre malattie trasmissibili. Si stima che circa 5.4 milioni di Somali si trovino in condizione di insicurezza alimentare e necessitino di interventi urgenti per la sopravvivenza. L'intervento prevede attivit\u00e0 di emergenza anche volte al rafforzamento della resilienza con approccio DRR (Disasters Risk Reduction), di chi si trova in situazioni vulnerabili, aumentandone la capacit\u00e0 di fronteggiare futuri shock climatici, economici e sociali.",

        "description": "A locust invasion in Somalia is threatening livelihoods as crops and vegetation for livestock foraging suffer extensive damage. According to the Somaliland National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) localized damage has been observed in Somaliland, where locusts have occupied a total of 100,000ha of Somaliland\u2019s coastal region including Woqooyi Galbeed. This has affected1,087,264 people, of which 22,853 are in IDPs camps. SC has observed the impact of the locust invasion to be most severe in Hargeisa Maroodijeh with 8,000ha of rangeland and 3,000ha of crop land damaged. In addition, Agabar and Arbasiyo villages in Gabiley districts have also been hard-hit with 1,000ha of damaged land. The Woqooyi Galbeed region was already characterized by significant food security gaps which is exacerbated by the desert locust crisis. According to the FSNAU technical release 153,000 people are food insecure (IPC 3 or 4) including 12,054 in Gabiley district and 139,134 in Hargeisa district. An SC survey showed that pastoralists are skipping meals or selling their remaining livestock for low prices to purchase food. There is also an increasing trend of labor migration at the critical time of Gu seasonal preparation. Only few actors respond to the locust crisis in this area including SOS and World Vision. Response gaps affirmed by the Food Security Cluster (FSC) monthly dashboard show 150,000 people need urgent Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to protect access to food security. These include IDPs and pastoralists who have lost their livestock and have less than 6 goats. In addition to the locust crisis, Somalia is also at risk of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Somalia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 16th March 2020 and currently has 60 recorded cases including 5 in Somaliland and 2 in Woqooyi Galbeed. Given the rapid pace of the virus and lack of access to testing kits, there are concerns that the number of cases will rise rapidly.",

        "description": "Apart from the other layers of hazards existing in the target areas, COVID-19 had also impacted small scale farmers. It has been reported many farmers have abandoned their farming and sought an alternative source of income from the nearby towns. This has increased and exposed the farmers to the risk of COVID 19. \nA.\tFood security of poor farmers through revitalizing agricultural production in the targeted areas. Through cash for work, irrigation canal will be rehabilitated, and farm inputs will be supplied.  The rehabilitation work will be on excavating (desilting) of flood damaged canals.  This will improve the accessibility and availability of water for irrigation uses. Two canals with dimension of 2m width and 1m depth and 2km length will be rehabilitated. Each canal will provide water to 10 farms. In addition to this, the farmers will receive an improved seed such as maize, sesame, tomatoes and pumpkins.  Availing water and seeds to farmers will improve their farm activities and reduce the risk of seeking labour to unsafe environments. In doing this the farmers will start producing by themselves and subsequently able to both feed their families and sell their produce. The project will link to farmers to the existing potential markets through establishing a network between agriculture traders and target farmer groups.  This activity will be done for 15 days by 200 farmers at a rate of $5 per day. Each farm will be distributed with farm equipment\u2019s worth $200\n\nB.\tIncreased employment opportunity through VSLA and income generating activities:  As COVID 19 had mostly impacted poor and vulnerable people who were dependent on market activities such as labour, aid and family support. In the first phase, the project had transferred cash to maintain the minimum food basket for target households.  The cash had supported families to sustain their livelihoods in specific periods of the project. In order to move to an early socio-economic recovery, on the second phase, the project intends to transition from short term cash transfer to more sustainable income generating activities.  The project will introduce a village, saving and loans association approach (VSLA) to improve access to financial resources for poor households, targeting women in priority. The primary purpose of a VSLA is to provide simple savings and loan facilities and through these and other enabling activities empower women to manage resources and invest them for the benefit of their household. Loans can provide a form of self- insurance to members, supplemented by a saving fund which provides small but important income to members in distress. The VSLA system enables members of a self-selected group to voluntarily save money through purchasing shares. The savings are then invested in a loan fund from which members can borrow as well as meet their immediate needs such as food, water and health care or make further investments to diversify and increase their incomes. The project will support 15 VSLA groups of 15 \u2013 20 members with initial seed fund of 3000 USD for each group. The activity will start with community mobilization, selection of households to participate and group formation. While the methodology is simple, it depends on a very carefully structured system of training. Over seven sessions, groups learn to: form their associations; define a purpose; elect officials; design their system of savings, insurance and credit; and practice running savings and credit meetings. Once this process is completed, VSLAs can begin to save and to lend. They are supervised over a period of 12 months by field staffs who ensure procedures and systems work properly and that the groups can function independently thereafter;\n\nC.\tHealth: Strengthened capacity of existing health facilities and services to combat Covid-19. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to 3 health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections. Other activities also include procurement of medicines, community mobilization outreach and training of frontline health workers. IR will also work with the government hospitals and other unit of covid-19 task force in the preparation of covid roll-out. IR will support through advocacy and media outreach for people to accept and take the vaccines. This approach of advocacy, lobbying through media and electronic information sharing will enable the roll-out of vaccines. IR will also use its health facilities as centre for passing information to patients and their dependents to take up vaccines once its made available. Similarly, IR will by making available a vehicle and a driver support the ministry of health with logistics mainly in Balaad, Baidoa and Bandar districts.\n\nD.\tWASH: The project will expand water points in IDPs. In some IPDs for instance Dayniile district, the accessibility of water stands for handwashing is still very small. The water point will allow beneficiaries to easily access water points for handwashing in their proximity.  The expansion will include laying out of pipes and construction of fenced water points. The expansion will improve the sanitation and hygiene of IDP communities so that they can prevent from themselves the spread of COVID 19 pandemic. The water points will be placed in strategic position such as schools and health centres. Additionally, IR will construct water tanks, piping system, training of water committee with a view to make water available for covid-19 prevention. \n\nE.\tProtection: Since there is a prevailing reports of incidence of gender based violence, early marriage, the project will carry out an awareness sessions including training of women and men. These sessions will be in line with Islamic Relief Somalia safeguarding and protection principles.",

        "description": "The key objective is to implement preventative measures for vulnerable groups that have limited access to COVID-19 prevention and response actions. This is to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in urban IDP settings. The intervention will focus on the most vulnerable groups: older people \u2013 forming approximately 2.7 per cent of the population and the urban poor and IDPs about 75% of the population. Assessments shows these as most vulnerable who are heavily impacted by COVID-19 infection. For this response, IRS seeks to complement the efforts of the government and other humanitarian organisation in Somalia by reaching approximately 40,000 beneficiaries directly and up to 200,000 indirectly.\n1. Risk communication and community engagement. The proposed project will support preventative measures to combat the spread of COVID 19. This will include extensive awareness initiatives using multiple media channels to support preventative action of the government and communities. The information/ education and communication is designed to reach the population  through print, audio-visual media messages, SMS and community mobilisation using religious/community/group leaders and elders. Display monitors on COVID 19 risks and prevention in local language will be installed at strategic locations such as roundabouts, airports and community centres in IDP camps.\n2.  Health: Strengthen existing health facilities in the selected IDP camps to combat COVID 19 infection. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to seven health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will also set up and equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections.\n3. WASH: Reduce the spread of COVID 19 and decrease morbidity and mortality in the selected districts. The project improve hygiene practices, limiting infection IDP camps.24 hand-washing stations will be built in the IDP camps in Bondhere, Baidoa, Balcad, Gardho and Burtinle. Hygiene kits, containing bath soap, laundry soap, 2 jerry cans, and facemask, will be supplied to 3500 households. Special consideration will be given to female headed household and PWD. \n4. Livelihood: Improving livelihoods through unconditional cash transfer of USD 70 for 3 months to 333 households, and USD 70 cash assistance for 2 months to 333 households as livelihoods support. The beneficiaries will be selected using robust selection criteria that targets the most vulnerable and prioritise female headed household. The UCT will be done using mobile money transfer which has the benefit of increased security, convenience, privacy, speed, reduced operational/transaction costs and logistics for the beneficiaries and for Islamic relief. Somalia has large mobile network reach. The choice of money gives the beneficiaries the widest range of transactional capabilities and broad access to basic financial services (such as deposit, withdrawal, person-to-person transfers and e-money transactions with registered traders of goods and service providers). Islamic Relief used mobile money in drought/ flood emergency programme (including WFP Baxnaano programme). The lessons from previous experience which guide the choice of UCT include: \n-  Beneficiaries purchase a more diverse set of goods, had higher dietary diversity,\n- Beneficiaries depleted fewer assets and grew more types of crops, especially marginal cash crops grown by women.  They are able to o restock livelihood assets faster. The reasons for this can be attributed to the lower costs and greater privacy of receiving a cash transfer via the mobile transfer, as well as changes in intra-household decision-making.\n5. Establish complaint management and feedback mechanism to the affected population. Through this intervention, IR MEAL unit will ensure that project delivers responses as designed to the affected population. Through an established mechanism of complaints mechanism and feedback channels, the affected population will be made to understand and demand their rights until all is provided to their satisfaction. \n6. Build and establish DRR community champions for covid-19 preparedness, response and treatment. The established committee is trained on covid-19 risk reduction management. Their role is to ensure that community members are made aware of the impact of covid-19, where to seek treatment and how to enforce containment measures such as social distancing and use of mask and sanitisers as part of exposure reduction. \nIRS will lead the implementation. The project will build on existing IRS interventions in health WASH and livelihood sectors and maximise the impact and sustainability",

        "description": "Some 1.5 billion people, half of the world\u2019s poor, live in fragile settings where the government is unable or unwilling to fulfill its core responsibilities to protect and care for its citizens. In such fragile settings, often characterized by variable levels of violent conflict, perspectives for stability and sustainable inclusive development - key priorities of the Dutch Government - continue to be extremely bleak. Whereas each fragile setting is unique, a broad international consensus exists on the multiple and complex causes that need to be addressed for a transition out of fragility. Among these, establishing inclusive governance processes is considered essential. A key obstacle for achieving stability and sustainable development in fragile settings is the structural exclusion of segments of society from local, district level and national governance processes. Our theory of change (TOC) addresses this with a focus on inclusive governance processes, referring to the extent to which governance processes provide space to overcome the systematic exclusion of disadvantaged groups seeking to participate in decision making. Therefore this strategic partnership\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to inclusive and effective governance processes in fragile settings. Specific target and impact groups may vary country by country and will be determined on the basis of thorough analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of women in governance processes is key to stability and development in all countries and therefore crosscuts all program interventions.",

Special focus will be on gender sensitive interactive program production that informs the audiences and increase their participation in the public debate. -Free Press Unlimited will contribute to the set up of an enabling environment and regulatory framework that ensures fair and free media by technical assistance to journalist associations. Free Press Unlimited will continue its work with the Somalia Media Support Group (SMSG) where it advocates for ethical journalism and press freedom on a more institutional and political level. FPU will also continue its anti-sharuur (envelope journalism) campaign to improve public trust in ethical journalism. -hanks to its large network of partner radios FPU can connect Civil Society Organsations with people living in remote areas that normally cannot be reached due to security reasons. The aim is to improve the ability of civil society actors to lobby for the needs of the population and advocate with authorities to develop laws and policies to Somalia\u2019s societal development. -FPU will build the capacity and support the safety of those working/participating in our program through holistic security training (of trainers). To this end Free Press Unlimited will share and develop the best available knowledge, lessons, curricula and (digital and physical) tool kits on safety, risk mitigation and emergency protection for media workers and reporters.",

        "description": "Long-running conflict has destroyed the infrastructure of the Somali state and the country has one of the worst health indicators in the world. The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proj\nect's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinic?s personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

        "description": "The project builds on the previous TB intervention implemented by LSV. However in order to increase effectiveness totally new strategies will be applied.TB continues to be an essential health problem in Somalia. The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rathe\nr new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the privat\ne sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration \nwith the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and \nparticipation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB cult\nure services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to \nTB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO\n called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The \nproject will help the poorest of the poor. For example many cases are found among people who suffer from malnutrition.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

The legitimacy of the state however is still weak. Conflicts and violence remain a significant challenge\n. The biggest threat is still Al Shabaab but violent conflicts between clans and militias as well as organized crime are also common. The weak security situation hampers development efforts and attempts to address the difficult humanitarian situation.Finn \nChurch Aid (FCA) and the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers have been active in mediation and local-level democratisation and institution building in Somalia for several years. In 2017 an expert was seconded to the Ministry for Interior Fede\nral Affairs and Reconciliation (MoIFAR) at the request of the Somali government. The expert has held a key position in the team in charge of drafting the strategy for reconciliation. During the years 2018-2019 the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland ha\ns supported national and local-level reconciliation processes through FCA and the Network. The first phase of the project saw the development of a nation-wide National Reconciliation Framework based on consultations with state and civil society actors. In \nFebruary 2019 the draft was validated at a national conference in Mogadishu. Altogether 300 representatives from the federal government federal member states and civil society took part in the conference. The National Reconciliation Framework was approved \nby the Cabinet in in March 2019. It has become one of the key priorities of the Somali government and especially MoIFAR.The second phase of the project supports MoIFAR in the implementation of the national reconciliation process while advancing the partici\npation of women and youth in the process. The project also includes support to local-level reconciliation. Finland supports the second phase of the project with 461 384 euros. The project will be implemented over a period of 12 months in 2019-2020.",

        "title": "Fighting TB in Somalia: public-private partnerships and inclusive communities",
        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

Increase access to, utilisation and quality of health and nutrition services at community, primary and secondary health levels, especially for women, children and vulnerable populations and; 2. Strengthen the health system under the stewardship of the Somali Health Authorities (SHAs). The project\u2019s approach focuses on strengthening the SHAs\u2019 capacity at the regional, district and community levels to deliver the EPHS (core services 1-6). Lessons from Joint Health Nutrition Programme (JHNP) and other programmes, identified a critical management gap at the district level in Banadir. A core focus of the project\u2019s methodology is therefore to support the Regional health Officer (RHO) in Banadir to establish and develop a District Health Management Team (DHMT) in each of the 10-targeted districts. Having an operational management body at district level, within the SHA structure, will be an essential component of ensuring that the health facilities and community/female health workers (CHWs/FHWs), in their respective districts, are able to receive the technical, management and logistical support required for them to successfully deliver integrated, quality, health and nutrition services that the population can access. This is a structure and model that has been demonstrated to be successful in other health systems (e.g. in Kenya). The consortium will work closely with the RHO throughout the project to establish, develop and support the DHMTs.",

        "description": "The Daryeel Mobile Health Clinic ?project aims at providing preventive and basic health care services to rural areas outside of Afmadow town in Jubaland Somalia. The project is executed by the Finland-Somalia Association (FSA) with partner NGO SAHDA and th\ne Jubaland Ministry of Health. The project is a continuation of the Maternal and Child Health Services Clinic ?project that the FSA has ran since 2011 in Afmadow town. Based on an agreement with the Jubaland Ministry of Health the FSA has been asked to swi\ntch its foces to more remote villages through a mobile clinic. The mobile clinic is to start its operations in 2018 depending on permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland. With this application the project plan is to continue the Mobile He\nalth Clinic through 2019-2020 a total of three years.The main development problem that the project aims to solve is the poor access to preventive and basic health care in the Afmadow area in Jubaland Somalia. The project aims to take health services close \nto remote communities where it is difficult to get access to basic healthcare and where travelling is a challenge. By curing and providing basic health services in remote locations the project contrib-utes to creating a healthier community and society with\n people who are able to work for their own livelihoods. In this context the project contributes significantly to achieving the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals. The development impact that the project strives for is to increase the wellbeing of the commu\nnities in the project area and to decrease the number of diseases and illnesses.The mobile clinic concept includes three core outputs:1. Supporting existing healthcare by providing health services in suburbs nearby villages and towns2. Providing supportive\n services in first aid family reproductive services and interventions reducing infectious diseases in the target villages3. Reducing travelling for health services from the towns as well as building the competence of the local community in health particula\nrly by giving tools and knowledge to local midwives.",

This pilot project will serve as a business validation project and as a reference for the following clients and \nfinanciers who will need to be in quickly after the first project in order to grow the business. Because of the importance of the project the customers and the target have been selected with care and also the price of electricity and hence the portability \nof the project has been somewhat tinged to the normal target level in order to remain customer relationship good and stable.The main customer of the pilot project is Barbara Cafe Hargeisa's Deero Mall. The owner of the client is SLA's long-time acquaintanc\ne the owner of the customer business has also helped SLA in business development so it is expected that the customer relationship will be working. In addition electricity will be sold at least to the FlyDubai Hargeisa office (Emirates airline low cost airl\nine that also fly between Helsinki and Dubai) ans several other outlets in located in the same mall.The system itself is a 100 kW (DC) / 90 kW (AC) photovoltaic system (100 kWp panel power and 90 kW inverter power) with 221 kWh battery capacity (16 x 13.8 \nkWh BYD batteries). There is more demand for electricity in the mall but the size of the project is currently limited by a roof area that does not allow a larger number of solar panels. The investment cost of the entire physical system (iron) including log\nistics customs local transport installations etc. is approximately USD 206000. In addition the launch of the PPA business requires an enterprise resource planning system enabling remote reading control mobile payment etc. which will also cost USD 27000. Th\ne system generates about 178000 kWh of electricity annually of which approximately 70000 kWh is sold to Barbara Cafe and the remaining approximately 110000 kWh sold to other shopping mall users already discussed and because the price of electricity from ot\nher customers is remarkably high it is clear that all electricity can be sold. Negotiations for other PPAs are ongoing.",

However since the companies in fragile countries are rarely investment ready the trust between the investor and investee n\needs to be built gradually therefore FCA will as a first step provide technical Assistance (TA) to the target companies (based on their unique needs) to enable them improve their systems. The next step is to then identify the 'gazelles' SME's/companies tha\nt have shown potential in terms of both sustainability and resilience and process these companies for further financial support (investment). There are clear signs that development banks (e.g. AfDB IFC and IsDB) are open to providing TA funds for SME's in \nfragile countries and are only held back by a lack of trustworthy service providers. FCA will therefore tap into this funding by leveraging its country level infrastructure and expertise (e.g. 3 offices and over and over 25 employees in Somalia 5 Employees\n in Eritrea and 26 Employees in Jordan) to ensure sustainability of this project in the medium term with the SME's paying their way in the long term. Considering country specific activity;In Somalia Finnpartnership?s ?The Somalia Business Pilot project? is\n coming to an end and the FCA project could utilize and strengthen the already established business relations between Finnish and Somali companies and to promote business projects and investments in Somalia.

        "title": "Sustainable Access to clean Water,Hygiene and Sanitation to droughts affected communities in Sanaag and Sool region",
        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Northern Somalia in 2018 remains fragile due to residual impact of drought, Cyclone Sagar, conflict and ongoing displacement. While the risk of famine has reduced, humanitarian needs remain high, with extreme water and pasture shortages reported in rainfall deficit areas of Bari, Nugaal, Sool and Sanaag regions. Water scarcity in Sool and Sanaag regions has reached a precarious level, affecting the health of the most vulnerable people and causing occasional resource-based clan conflicts. With only a third of the population having access to improved sanitation, poor hygiene practices (including frequent open defecation) are prevalent, contributing to incidences of water-borne diseases. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve WASH service delivery at district level. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness. \n\nACTED will implement these activities in Taleex district of Sool region, and Erigavo and Dararweyne districts of Sanaag region, targeting a highly vulnerable and largely undeserved area. Approximately 15,000 people (2,500 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, or escalation of conflict, which may cause communities to flee to other areas.",

Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs and emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. As hygiene promoters will interact closely with students during hygiene promotion sessions and recreational activities, CISP will train this cadre on hygiene promotion, psycho-social support (PSS), and child protection and safeguarding. Specific Protection activities will include the mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, and awareness raising and training of community education committees (CEC) on child protection. CISP will also continue to engage with Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE) and train cluster partners and MoE staffs on safe schools contingency planning, DRR and emergency response. CISP will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, proposal development, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, CISP will provide cash grants to CECs. In return, CECs will contribute in-kind or cash to procure safe water and manage its distribution to students. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacity and improve school preparedness against armed attack and other natural disasters. Disability and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. CISP will coordinate enrollment drives through MoE and with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. CISP education department will utilize the existing synergies with CISP protection department to assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, and, as determined from the assessment results, targeted schools will develop appropriate action plans to address areas of concern. To measure the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, CISP will conduct an end line assessment. Through the CISP protection department engagement with CEC\u2019s and the regional Gender Focal Points (GFP\u2019s) of MoE, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

We will utilize existing vocational training\ncentres to deliver competency-based training programmes which respond to the\nneeds of Somali employers, as identified during the value chain study.\nBeneficiaries will be provided with certification upon the completion of the\ntraining.Identifying current and anticipating future\nskills needs is the first building block of relevant training and skills\nstrategies. Several methods are\nused to forecast future skills needs. These include: forecasting occupational\nand skills profiles; labour market information systems and employment services;\nengagement with the private sector; and assessments of the performance of\ntraining institutions and the employment outcomes of their trainees.There exist opportunities for more specific technical and vocational training and\nentrepreneurship training at various stages of value chains, particularly\nin input supply and production to promote the inclusion of youth. Lack of\nskills in particular crafts is one of the biggest problems which can be tackled\nthrough the provision of well-designed training courses to increase the\nproductivity of youth. Similarly, opportunities for business start-ups and\ngrowth of existing businesses can be facilitated through a comprehensive\nmanagement/training programme aimed at starting and improving businesses and\nproviding business development services (BDS).It should be noted that youth aspirations are different from what is\noffered in some sectors, in particular the farming sector. Regardless of the economic opportunities available in the farming\nsector, young Somali men and women are being utilized as labourers within\nfamily farms which youth are not interested in.Key to the project strategy will be making the agriculture sector\nattractive for youth who are not necessarily looking to be involved in farming. This will be achieved through the involvement of youth in the\nlivestock, input provision and processing stage of the value chains which will\nbe selected. This is because youth will be involved in agriculture when it\noffers real business opportunities. Farming will also be attractive for youth\nif it is technology driven. Enhancing timely access to market information and\ncommunication, production techniques, new technology and financing\nopportunities will modernise the farming sector and will take full advantage of\na generation of young Somalis who are more technologically inclined, more\neducated and more willing to taking higher entrepreneurial risks than their\nelders.It is important that skill development initiatives do not only focus\non hard, job-related skills, but also on \u201csoft skills\u201d that are deemed more and\nmore important by employers and are needed for the personal growth of youth. The \u2018Youth for Change' initiative of UNDP, UNICEF, and ILO has shown\nthat through psycho-social rehabilitation and skills development, youth can be\ndiscouraged from joining criminal and violent groups, can recuperate, and can\ngive something back to their families and communities. This is a process of\nempowerment that can lead to children going to school and youths taking up\nvocational training. It shows how such engagement with youth can promote social\ncohesion and peace. \u201cSoft skills\u201d like leadership, personal financial planning,\ncommunication and information technology will encourage development of positive\nattitudes needed for employment. Other useful life-skills include health\ninformation, civic engagement, protection of rights and political inclusion.\nPsycho-social counselling and support services are necessary for youth who have\nbeen victims of violence and need re-integration into society and will be\nmainstreamed within the life-skills package. Building on a Construction Sector Analysis conducted under the SECIL project, a one-stop youth centre will be\nestablished in Mogadishu focusing specifically on construction skills\ndevelopment and building material production combined with life skills\ntraining. In order to specifically target young women, the one stop youth\ncentre in Mogadishu will also provide hospitality training.The three satellite centres will\nbe linked to vocational training centres rehabilitated by ILO and will be\nlocated in other urban areas than Mogadishu and will provide life skills\ntraining only. The main One stop youth centre\nin Mogadishu and the three satellite centres; this centre will utilize an integrated approach to youth\ndevelopment by providing both young men and women with safe spaces in urban\nsettings where they can undergo specialized vocational training(in the case of\nMogadishu), meet and access information and resources critical to creating\nlivelihoods. The Centre will also offer young men and women a choice of various\narts, culture, recreation, and health services. Separate programmes and space\nfor young men and young women will be developed where needed. This component will\nbe expanded based on the needs identified by the city and the youth of\nMogadishu.Capacity of Benadir Regional\nAdministration (BRA) to implement youth projects and mainstream youth aspects\ninto local government projects and programmes, in particular the one stop\ncentre, will be strengthened through the establishment and training of a youth\nunit and a youth advisory board at BRA. The Role of the youth unit and youth\nadvisory board will be established by BRA and FGS but may include mainstreaming\nyouth issues at the local level, policy development (for local government),\norganisation of youth events, job fairs etc. Both, youth unit and youth\nadvisory board, will be a model for other urban areas to be replicated and\nscaled up in the second phase of the programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of capacity development, relevant government ministries and institutions will acquire\ninstitutional and technical capacity development on methods of collection,\nanalysis and storage of labour market and skills data. Their national statistics\ncentre (Minister of Planning and International Cooperation) along with the Ministry\nstatistical units, will be strengthened with technical assistance from a\ntechnical expert who will be seconded to the line ministries. This assistance\nwill improve labour market information analysis processes and institutional\ncapacity at the national and regional level. The development of a full-fledged labour\nmarket information system will take many years; however, the proposed programme\nwill begin to train ministries and institutions for better collection and\nanalysis of data relevant to developing appropriate skills training programmes\nfor youth employment. Furthermore, tools, equipment and operational support\nwill be provided to vocational training institutions and the one-stop youth\ncentre. Identifying, selecting and training teachers in the development of competency-based\ncurricula, and in the delivery and assessment of these training courses, will\nbe core activities for capacity development of technical vocational training\ninstitutions. Furthermore, training managers will be provided with mentoring\nsupport to ensure the sustainability of vocational training centres.",

        "description": "UNSOS is committed to reduce the environmental footprint of the mission\nin its host country, Somalia. It wants to improve the environmental performance\nof the mission by introducing sustainable design and operation (as much as the\nsituation in Somalia permits). This means addressing solid waste, wastewater,\nuse of energy and resource management as whole. UNSOS wants to achieve this by\nintroducing a systematic Environmental Management System (EMS) to each sector\nof the mission, which can be approved by an international organization of\nstandards (ISO) in the long-term. \n\n\n\nCurrently, UNSOS has a mission specific Environmental Policy (pending\napproval) that was drafted in reference to DPKO/DFS\nEnvironmental Policy for UN Field Missions, established in June 2009. The\npolicy defines environmental standards and objectives for UN field missions as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\u201cEach United\nNations field mission will take actions to integrate environmental measures\ninto its planning and operations in order to avoid and minimize the impact of\nactivities carried out by the mission and its staff on the environment and to\nprotect human health from such environmental impact. ?Such measures will be undertaken throughout all phases of a United\nNations field mission, including: Initial planning of the mission; setting up of logistic arrangements for the mission; maintenance and\noperations of the mission; closing of the mission.\u201d ?\n\n\n\nAn environmental policy (by itself) does not bring about a change in\npractices. Only the EMS is a guarantee that the Environmental Policy is\nactually implemented and that applicable standards are consistently met by the\norganisation during its operation. Only through the operationalization of a\npolicy will it be possible to minimise the environmental footprint of sector\nhubs and associated operations. Hence, the EMS means the operationalization of the environmental policy in place\nand to achieve set objectives and targets.\n\nThe Secretary General (SG) in his letter to the president of the Security Council dated 7 October\n2015 (S/2015/762 on the review of AMISOM and UNSOA) underlined that: \n\n\n\n\u201cThe impact on the environment of the United\nNations-supported activities in Somalia also remains a concern. The review\nnoted the absence of an environmental baseline study, dedicated environmental\nmanagement capacities and an African Union environmental policy to guide AMISOM\noperations, particularly with regard to wastewater management.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe strengthening of UNSOA and its conversion into UNSOS also includes\nthe development of capacities for adequate environmental management. \n\n\n\nThe Board of Auditors in its 2015 review of the operation of UNSOA formulated the following\nrecommendations: \n\n\n\nUNSOS is to develop a plan for undertaking and updating periodically\nenvironmental baseline studies of all Mission's locations in order to comply\nwith DPKO/DFS Policy on Environment for UN Field Missions.\n\nUNSOS is (a) develop a guideline of maintaining records of waste produce\nin the Mission; and (b) develop a database of waste produced in the Mission and\nupdate it accordingly. \n\nUNSOS is to develop effective mechanism such as action plan and effective\nmonitoring system for ensuring the Mission comply with the environmental policy\nrequirements.\n\n\n\nThe subsequent Security Council\nResolution (S/2015/840) stated the following:\n\n\n\n\u201cFurther requests the Secretary-General to consider the environmental impact\nof the UN fulfilling its mandated tasks, including carrying out an\nenvironmental baseline study and regular environmental impact assessments of\nthe operations of UNSOM and UNSOS.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll of the above mentioned elements point towards the fact that missions\nneed to take practical measures to obtain tangible results in order to meet the\nguidelines set forth in the DPKO/DFS Policy.",

        "title": "Youth Political Empowerment: Enabling Somali Young Women And Men To Meaningfully Engage In Governance, Peacebuilding And Reconciliation Efforts",
        "description": "In light of the context and gap\nanalysis, the proposed intervention seeks the support of the UN Peacebuilding\nFund to increase the inclusion of young men and women in state and\npeacebuilding processes in Somalia. More specifically, since Somalia is in the process\nof reestablishing legitimate State institutions and systems of governance at\nthe Federal Member State and District level, this intervention seeks to\ncapitalize on this in order to ensure these structures are including young men\nand women and take their priorities into account. With the passing of the Local\nGovernment Laws in South West and Jubbaland States in July 2017, both states\nhave launched their respective District Council formation processes. It is\nvital that these governance bodies have youth representation and address the\nneeds of young Somali men and women for these new institutions to be\nrepresentative and perceived as legitimate by their constituents. While other\ndonor funds are supporting stabilization and peacebuilding efforts at the community\nlevel, as well as the development of local government institutions and systems,\nthere is currently no intervention specifically promoting the inclusion of\nyoung men in women in state and peacebuilding processes in South West State and\nJubbaland. An investment of the Peacebuilding Fund to support such an\ninitiative is anticipated to have a dual catalytic effect by changing the\nattidudes of decision makers and their constituences in Kismayo, Baidoa and\nDollow in favor of youth inclusion and by improving the representativity of\ndistrict and state level governance structures. This expected outcome will have\na substantial impact of intergenerational relations, enabling young men and\nwomen to become key agents of change in the peace and statebuilding processes\nof Jubbaland and South West States. This proposal directly supports the\noutcomes of the current Peacebuilding Priority Plan for Somalia (2016-19) which\naims to strengthen the demand for and offer of good governance \u2013 rebuilding the\nsocial contract between Somali citizens and the Somali State. The proposed\nintervention therefore also directly contributes to the implementation of the\nFederal Government of Somalia\u2019s Wadajir Framework for Local Governance and to\nits Stabilization Strategy. The Youth\nPolitical Empowerment Programme\naims to provide young people and youth-led organisations, particularly young\nwomen\u2019s organisations, in Baidoa, Dollow and Kismayo with the tools and\nopportunities to meaningfully engage in decision-making, including the\nconstitutional review process as well as state-building and reconciliation\nefforts at the district level. The programme supports\nthe implementation of UNSC Resolution\n2250 (2015), which recognises the important and positive contribution of\nyouth to the promotion and maintenance of peace and security. The proposed\nintervention will enable marginalized youth in Somalia to engage in\nstate and peacebuilding efforts at the local and federal levels. This directly\nsupports the implementation of the UN Youth Strategy Principles which has\nidentified the political participation, empowerment, leadership,\nprotection of youth human rights, inter-generational collaboration as\npriorities. The programme also supports the ongoing efforts\nto develop a National Youth Policy for Somalia. The proposed intervention is\nalso aligned with the Federal Government of Somalia\u2019s National Development Plan\nwhich mainstreams youth as a cross-cutting issue throughout the nations\npriorities in order to contribute towards stability, economic prosperity and\nnational cohesion. The difficult security and\npolitical context in Somlia, calls for innovative ways to reach-out, engage,\nand mobilize youth.Therefore, the programme will facilitate the use of\ninnovative communication platforms including social media (Facebook, Twitter,\netc), radio podcasts, and web TV, to reach out to youth creating a channel for\nyoung women and men to express their visions for the future of Somalia. By\namplifying young people\u2019s voices, the programme will promote the exchange of ideas\namong peers and communities at large, challenging negative perceptions and\nfostering an intergenerational dialogue and trust. In view of the specific\nneeds of young women identified above, the programme will adopt a gender\nresponsive approach, mainstreaming gender issues in all activities and ensuring\nequal access to benefits for both women and men of the different age groups.\nThe programme will particularly ensure the participation of young women, as\nthey traditionally suffer double discrimination (age and gender). Based on a\nrealistic assessment of the Somali context and the challenges faced by Somali\nwomen, all capacity building workshops and councils will aim to have at least\n40% young women beneficiaries. After assessing the needs of young women\u2019s organizations,\nthe programme decided to employ a gender mixed approach to the different\ninitiatives, bringing young women and men together, enabling a collaborative\napproach, while sensitizing young men in the process.The programme will also provide\ntraining and strengthen the institutional capacity of the local administrations\nin Baidoa, Dollow and Kismayo to respond to the needs of young women and men.\nBy employing an area based approach to improve coordination amongst all levels\nof government. The programme provides a catalytic\nopportunity to build on recent peace and state-building gains and builds on\nrecommendations from the Security Council Resolution 2250 on youth, peace and\nsecurity and the National Youth Conference held in 2015, which identified the\nneed for dialogue platforms at the local and regional levels.The programme proposal was\ndeveloped in close consultation with Y-Peer Network, and other local youth\norganisations in the target areas. Prior to implementation, further\nmobilization of young women and youth organizations will take place. In August\n2017, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports employed their national radio\nprogramme \u201cAsk Your Friend\u201d to hold consultations with young women and men.\nOver 450 young people engaged through radio call-ins and emails. The findings\nfrom the radio survey highlighted that 55% of respondents emphasized there is a\ndire need for youth to meaningfully engage in peacebuilding. They also raised\nthe need for more efforts to minimize or respond to clan disputes, tackle\nillegal migration and prevent violent extremism. Moreover, 30% of the\nrespondents, underscored that youth-led community action should be prioritized\nwhile 15% of the respondents underscored the need for increased youth\nparticipation in political and governance decision-making processes.",

        "description": "UNDP and UN-Habitat are cooperating in the UN Joint Programme for Youth Employment, which \u2013 since its inception in October 2015 - has provided training and work opportunities to over 6,000 young women and men. This Action will build upon the successful model created, greatly contributing to and enhancing realistic livelihood opportunities for youth, with a strengthened focus on IDPs and returnees. This Action will significantly build on this work in the following ways:\u2022\tProviding youth in the targeted IDP communities with mentorship and entrepreneurship training;\u2022\tProviding safe spaces for IDP youth to learn and acquire the necessary skills to access the labour market for sectors that are immediately remunerative;\u2022\tEnabling IDPs to become more competitive in the lucrative sectors of the labour market.UNHCR has established a capacity building curriculum under the Protection Cluster focusing on protection and durable solutions for displaced populations, international humanitarian law, housing, land and property rights protection, including protection against forced evictions, as well as humanitarian negotiations. This Action will utilise the capacity building curriculum in the following ways:\u2022\tProviding eviction guidelines to authorities and law enforcement sectors explaining lawful evictions processes and their implementation;\u2022\tTraining of authorities on the protection of IDPs, durable solutions and protection of housing, land and property rights for IDPs and other vulnerable groups, notably against force evictions;\u2022\tConduct advocacy campaigns on IDP specific protection and durable solution-related challenges in the Mogadishu context.UNDP and UN-Habitat have been working on the Joint Programme for Local Governance (JPLG) since 2008. The Programme has facilitated strong, dynamic and organic links with government and non-state actors. UNDP and UN-Habitat\u2019s efforts in strengthening local governance will be replicated in this Action by:\u2022\tProviding capacity building training to the municipality which aims to create knowledge surrounding standards and systems necessary to support social protection programmes such as rental subsidy, low-cost housing, and relocation of IDPs;\u2022\tFormulating by-laws at the local municipal level.Potential Synergies(Please refer to the potential synergy table on the attached prodoc.)In September 2015, the Somalia Protection Cluster supported by UN-Habitat and UNHCR held the first ever Housing, Land and Property forum in Mogadishu bringing together Federal authorities, the municipality, UN and NGOs as well as donors to deliberate on more sustainable approaches to address forced evictions and support urban durable solutions. The outcomes of this forum and the relevant follow up processes also inform this proposal. Future Housing, Land and Property fora will further be used to support this Action.In December 2015, the DSRSG/RC/HC for Somalia launched the Somalia IDP Solutions Initiative advocated for by the Somalia Protection Cluster and supported by the three agencies participating in this joint action. This initiative was borne out of the need to urgently address the deteriorating situation of the IDPs and find durable solutions to protracted displacements. The Initiative seeks \u201cto complement still needed humanitarian assistance with development interventions to reverse the trend of protracted displacement and substantially reduce the number of IDPs in such displacement by facilitating and supporting durable solutions that bring them back into mainstream life and address underlying causes of their displacement and its protractedness.\u201d This initiative is led by the Federal Government of Somalia represented by H.E. Mohamed Arteh, Deputy Prime Minister, and the DSRSG/RC/HC. This action will actively and directly contribute towards the IDP Solutions Initiative",

The static facilities will be established in Ceelow and Caddow Uul locations  and Cadale districts respectively while the 4 outreach teams will serve 14 locations namely Bulo Axmed Cigow, Kulmis Weyn, Buurfuule and Xudur Ciise in Mahaday Ceelka Cusub, Cisiley and Sheikh Rooble Garas weyne, Cadan gabey and Ceel Xamar in Cadale Xanlay, Muki dheere Bari, Bulo Walaal and Caro faag in Balcad. WOCCA has engaged UNICEF for backstopping during training of the project staff, community health workers (CHWs) and mothers for the \u201cmothers MUAC approach\u201d, on nutrition screening and case identification, Integrated management of acute malnutrition(IMAM),Infant and young child feeding education (IYCF-E) and Nutrition, health and hygiene promotion (NHHP).The trained staff shall be deployed to the targeted locations, mobile and static OTPs where together with the trained mothers will screen children under 5 and PLWs. Children under 5 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) conditions and no medical complications will be enrolled to the static and mobile OTPs for treatment while the cases with medical complications will be referred by the mobile clinics and CHWs to the stabilization center (SC) in Waberi star village managed by WOCCA for nutrition and medical rehabilitation. Children under 5 and PLWs with MAM conditions will be referred to TSFP center managed by ARC. CHWs and Hygiene promoters will be trained on Nutrition, Health and Hygiene Promotion (NHHP), they will disseminate hygiene promotion messages to the communities to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera during the activities as they move around with the mobile Team. Mothers will be counseled individually and in groups by trained nutrition staff and Community Health Workers (CHWs) on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. The project will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MNPs) and Vitamin A supplements to pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of 5years through the static and mobile facilities. UNICEF has been supporting WOCCA with nutrition supplies and technical guidance on previous nutrition projects within the targeted locations and currently supporting our SHF funded project running in Daynille/Kaxda IDP camps and in Balcad district. Therefore, in this project WOCCA will still engage UNICEF to provide nutrition supplies and technical support for management of SAM cases. To enhance effective coordination, WOCCA will provide monthly activity updates with partners including Nutrition cluster both regional and Nairobi level, Other agencies working in the field who are doing other sector projects in the project sites will also be updated to avoid duplication and promote effective and efficient utilization humanitarian fund.",

The road to peace and development remains a long-term process, with\nsome regions being ahead of others. Currently, the most at-risk regions\ncorrelate with those that have remained marginal to development and\nhumanitarian interventions, including, inter\nalia, Middle and Lower Shabelle; Middle Juba, Galkayo District in Galmadug\nstate and parts of Bakool region. Longstanding clan grievances coupled with\nland and resource scarcity and political representation have led to al Shabaab\nexploiting the existing tensions making these regions fertile ground for\nconflict and displacement. \n\nThe\nproposed Action will primarily target the main urban centers where the\ndisplacement crises has been contributed to deepen the urban crises. Cities and\ntowns like Johwar and Beletweyne but also Dhusamareeb have a tremendous\ninfrastructure backlog. The floods in 2018 along the Shabelle River have caused\nadditional damage to urban infrastructure (see also Humanitarian Needs and\nResponse Plan 2019).\n\nThe\nprogramme will be aligned with and built on existing government priorities,\nplanning frameworks and strategies for both catalysing stability gains in the\ncountry, restoring state authority in recovered areas and finding lasting\nsolutions to displacement.

        "title": "Dhulka Nabaada (Land Of Peace): Land Reform In Somalia",
        "description": "After decades of insecurity and political instability, Somalia currently stands at a critical juncture for stabilization, peacebuilding and development. The prolonged conflict, in conjunction with the slow rise of political and state legitimacy, leaves the country with almost no functioning institutions and or rule of law. In 2012, the reestablishment of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), marked progress towards more permanent governance structure.Despite the considerable progress made in the last few years, the country still faces many challenges regarding political stability, peace and economic progress. One of those key challenges relates to land issues and how to address them in a systemic way in order to contribute to overall peacebuilding efforts.Land becomes intertwined with conflicts in various ways, primarily when dispossession takes place, or when rights to ownership, land use, access and transferability are consistently and arbitrarily violated. Any disruptive or forcefully imposed change on how groups and individuals connect to their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia has - resulted in various forms of organized violence and community disruption. Clan dynamics have also been a contributing factor to land conflict when there has been competition for the control of resources . With little to no effective state control of land or its administration, management and governance; armed groups and individuals can illegally acquire land, dispossess people, and forcibly evict the most vulnerable without due process. Those with access to social, economic and political power, coupled with the ability to use violence, have been able to illegally gain titles or control over land. The insecurity of tenure is also a significant barrier to the integration and economic development of displaced persons and communities. With the constant threat of forced evictions, displaced and vulnerable groups do not invest in the land, which impacts their ability to seek a livelihood.Political and socio-economic elites, and terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab, and the public at large including displaced populations are all current actors when it comes to land issues in Somalia. The State, due to political stagnation, insecurity and lack of institutional capacity has not been able to assert control over land management and governance or produce adequate land policies and legislation. An important role for the State will be to reclaim all public property and develop a cohesive land system that can produce policy or regulatory frameworks that govern land and land use in accordance with the rule of law. Elite groups with access to militia and financial resources are another actor whose unregulated actions disproportionately impact land markets and fuel land disputes and conflicts.Al-Shabaab remains a significant threat to the state and communities in many parts of the country and in most of the regions proposed for this programme. Different sources also assert that because of lack of trust in the formal justice system which is perceived as corrupt and clan based, people will prefer to go to Al-Shabaab courts to ensure protection of their land rights rather than to the formal court system. The public, including both host communities and displaced persons, is also another actor and the end-users this programme seeks to reach. Most often, the weakest and most vulnerable groups, they often face legal uncertainty, lack of protection and consistence violations to their housing, land and property rights.Another contributing factor to the land conflict dynamic in Somalia, which has only become more pronounced in recent years is migration and displacement. Due to years of conflict and natural disasters, millions of Somalis have been displaced and dispossessed of their land. Recent trends of returning refugees from neighboring countries and those who have been in a state of protracted displacement has resulted in large communities of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vulnerable groups living in informal settlements with little to no access to tenure security. Because of the current trends, it is predicted that this dynamic will continue, and programs must account for the reality that not only will rapid urbanization rates require urban resilience measures, but also promoting social cohesion is vital to peacebuilding initiatives. Protective measures for vulnerable groups through safeguarding basic human rights and enhancing security of tenure is not only important for land tenure purposes, but it also facilitates reintegration and economic development that can help stabilize and develop the region.Land disputes and conflict have disproportionate impacts on different groups within society. Women and youth are amongst the most disenfranchised when it comes to equal access to land use and ownership. With little formal recognition of rights to land and a male dominated customary land adjudication process, the rights of women are often periphery in land discussions. Ownership of land for Somali women is often linked to male relatives for greater protection. Such a reliance however limits their agency and poses a significant disadvantage to women-headed households. This programme will work towards enhancing women\u2019s access to justice as end-users and encouraging their participation in land governance and adjudication systems.Youth make up much of the Somali population, approximately 81.5% of the population is under the age of 35 . Despite the high number, this does not translate into proportionate political or social representation. They face numerous systemic barriers and require targeted advocacy to ensure that their rights are enforced. This project will benefit from, and work collaboratively with the PBF-funded Youth Political Empowerment project currently being implemented in Jubbaland and South West State. This program will aim to incorporate and integrate youth and their experiences, it will encourage their participation and ensure protection mechanisms are in place for them. Other vulnerable groups, including clan minorities are also marginalized when it comes to land access and rights. Using a human right centered approach to land management and supporting governments to standardize and promote land rights is key to a fair and equitable land reform process. By encouraging the participation of women and youth in land dispute resolution mechanisms we can begin to appropriately reflect the diversity of the communities in judicial and quasi-judicial processes.This project intersects on each of the five strategic priority areas from the UN Strategic Framework, and will directly support the realization of three of them:1. Supporting institutions to improve Peace, Security, Justice, the Rule of Law and Safety of Somalis 2. Strengthening accountability and supporting institutions that protect3. Strengthening resilience of Somali institutions, society and population8By enabling governments to address land conflicts in a meaningful way, this project will establish land dispute resolution mechanisms to enhance access to justice, improve security and contribute to overall peace and adherence to rule of law. To ensure full national ownership this project hopes to create enabling dynamics that allow national, state and local governments to take the lead and institutionalize these efforts. This project will not only contribute to the UN\u2019s strategic priorities, but also supports and aligns with several of the pillars of the Somali National Development Plan9 and the priority areas for each region. By working to improve land governance at local and national levels, this project contributes to enhancing Rule of Law, building effective and efficient institutions, supporting economic growth and safeguarding gender and human rights. Supporting customary and formal legal mechanisms that can address land disputes will work towards re-establishing the rule of law. A focus on land governance and management will also help build effective and efficient institutions that are better able to serve the public needs.The project is aiming at capacitating approximately 500 direct beneficiaries (local authorities and community members) to information management system to register land, as well as approximately a total of 200,000 indirect beneficiaries (50,000 per target location) benefiting from improved justice mechanism and land information management systems.",

        "description": "The proposed project studies war induced rapid urbanization processes in Somalia from the viewpoint of the most vulnerable in-migrants, people who were internally displaced (IDPs) in the cause of the on-going war. It investigates security perceptions and practices of IDPs in four cities of Somalia (including Puntland) and Somaliland and thereby focus on the capacities that vulnerable populations develop to cope with the effects of violence and displacement and to mitigate their vulnerability. Grounded in the everyday (Lefebvre, 1971 2016, De Certeau, 1984; Felski, 1999) and bridging urban and security studies, the project foregrounds people's own understandings of security, which risks and threats they identify, however narrow or broadly defined, and how these risks impede on their daily life (Crawford   Hutchinson 2015). In particular, the research asks: What does security mean and on which security arrangements do urban IDPs rely in the everyday? How do social, political, economic and environmental factors shape dynamics of everyday security? What continuities and change characterize security arrangements and everyday security in the course of migration to the city? With photo-voice, the project additionally proposes a methodology that gives 'voice' to people who are usually overheard or silenced, without however relying solely on their verbal capacities.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve the living conditions and\nlivelihood opportunities of displaced communities in Hargeisa through the\nprovision of durable shelter with secure land tenure, settlement\ninfrastructure, basic services, and skills training.A long-term, unresolved issue for the politically stabilized and\nsteadily growing city of Hargeisa\nis the large number of IDP families residing on former government land and in\npublic buildings. The local government has been trying to address this problem\nby identifying land for resettlement, but lacks the financial and technical\ncapacity to address the pressing housing situation and to find lasting\nsolutions. UN-HABITAT, with previous funding from the Government of Japan, has\nassisted the municipality by providing low-cost housing, improved services, skills\ntraining and livelihood opportunities to returnees and IDPs at the Ayaha-II\nsettlement area, on the southern fringe of Hargeisa.\n\nThe interventions carried out under this project respond to the\ncontinuous need to improve living standards and provide durable solutions for\nreintegration and resettlement of displaced communities in Hargeisa. In\nparticular, the project aims to reduce tensions between IDPs and host\ncommunities and incorporates issues of protection, and spatial and\nsocio-economic integration through permanent resettlement and improvement of\nlivelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable groups (women and youth).\n\nIn particular, the proposed project will target the resettlement and\nprovision of durable shelter for 350 returnee   IDP families in Hargeisa\noriginating from congested urban IDP settlements like the \u201cState House Area\u201d, a\nlarge piece of former government land in the central part of the city, which is\noccupied by an estimated number of 3,000 people. The location of the project activities\nwill be the new AYAHA-III settlement site (neighbouring the Ayaha-II area,\nwhich was the target of previous UN-HABITAT shelter activities). The site was\nformally approved for permanent re-settlement of IDPs by the Municipality already\nin 2010 and the re-settlement process has already begun in late 2011. The\nbeneficiary selection for permanent shelter under this project will undergo a\nlocally driven process to assure a fair selection.",

        "title": "Hargeisa Urban Water Supply Upgrading Project (Huwsup)",
        "description": "The overall objective of the project is to improve access to safe and affordable water and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable households in urban and peri-urban areas of Hargeisa city, through expanded supply of drinking water from sustainable water sources, and associated creation of employment opportunities.\nThe project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). \nThe specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: \ni. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; \nii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and \niii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.\nThe overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. \nAs requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. \nWhile the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:\nii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield\niii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. \niv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)\n\n\n\n\n[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project \u201cRehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System\u201d (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)",

It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). \nThe specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: \ni. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; \nii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and \niii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.\nThe overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. \nAs requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. \nWhile the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:\nii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield\niii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. \niv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)\n\n\n\n\n[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project \u201cRehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System\u201d (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)",

        "description": "It\nis clear that there is an urgent need to address the challenges that Somalia\nfaces regarding the lack of functioning economic infrastructure, service\nprovision, loss of social cohesion and chances for positive interactions among\nthe communities as well as the serious lack of sustainable economic\nopportunities for marginalized and vulnerable groups, especially women and\nyouth. \n\nIn\nMogadishu, where informal urbanization is advancing fast, priority should be\ngiven to public spaces, particularly those focused around economic\ninfrastructure and trading hubs, as a critical city component for economic\ngrowth, and as a driver of social cohesion where different collectivities can\nmeet and interact. The creation of such spaces for common use has the potential\nnot only to improve living conditions and public well-being, but also act as a\ncatalyst for the development of economic activity, private sector development,\nsustainable livelihood opportunities and job creation for the increasingly\npresent urban poor. The systematic and holistic development of public spaces is\na major element contributing to ensuring the development of the local economy\nand ensuring that growth is inclusive. \n\n\n\nMany previous and on-going\nprojects in Somalia have focussed on cash-for-work programmes and short-term\nemployment opportunities. UN-Habitat's extensive expertise in the fields of\nsustainable employment creation in Somalia, as well as upgrading public spaces\nand creating respective management systems, puts the organisation in an unique\nposition to significantly contribute to filling the current gap in Mogadishu's\neconomy and social wellness. The project aims to create public places that also\nserve as economic hubs for the generation of sustainable job opportunities, whilst\nalso contributing to the fostering of people-to people contacts and therefore\ncreating an optimal urban environment. This will in turn enhance the quality of\nlife of Mogadishu's residents, in particular for the urban poor, youth, women,\nand persons with disabilities.",

        "description": "The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote\nimprovements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace\nconsolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall\nobjective to be realised, a number of agents\nwill have to\npromote change that\ncan alter the\nstatus quo in\na direction that\nfosters a stronger, more\nresponsive and accountable\ncompact between the\nstate and its\ncitizens in the\nprovision of service delivery.\nDespite progress the\ncurrent context is\nstill characterised by\nlimited trust in\ngovernment structures at both central and local levels, which in turn\nmeans that their legitimacy is often contested.\nThis can increase the\nrisk of a\nreturn to instability\nand conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where\nradical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus\na need\nto consolidate and\nenlarge the space\nfor non-state actors\nin the rest\nof Somalia and\nto restore a healthy and accountable state citizen\nnexus. \n\n\n\nTo achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the\nprogramme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing\nstrategies: \n\n\n\n1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for\nfunctional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance\nthe role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a\nmeans to improve local service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 1 will focus on policy\nand legal frameworks across Somalia\nand is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on\ndecentralization in Somaliland and\nPuntland. These provide an incomplete\naccount of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local\ngovernment, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for\nimplementation. These issues need to be\nclarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and\ndistricts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; \n\n\n\n2. Improving local government capacity for\nequitable service delivery.\n\n\n\nOutcome 2 aims to address the\nweak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a\ncomprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements\nof local administration. It also seeks\nto improve coordination between\ndistricts and the\ncentre in planning\nand programming to ensure\nbetter consistency and use\nof resources. A third output is concerned with increasing\nlocally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;\nand, \n\n\n\n1.\nImproving\nand expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,\nresponsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nOutcome 3 focuses on improving\nthe delivery of local services. This is\nto be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line\ndepartments, engaging more\ndirectly with non-state\nproviders, and enhancing\nthe accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another\nelement relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private\ninvestment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. \n\n\n\nIn all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the\nparamount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment\nand leadership. Without these ingredients,\nthe prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek\nsupport and political commitment at the highest\nlevels of Government,\nand sustain commitments\nalready established in\nPhase I with\nthe Vice Presidents of Somaliland and Puntland nominated as Champions\nfor Local Governance.",

        "title": "Support The Efforts Of The Un-Habitat Global Programme On Public Space",
        "description": "UN-Habitat\nhas worked with the issue of public space for 15 years or more. However, at the\n23rd Governing Council of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States\nasked UN-Habitat to place a larger focus on public space and how it can\ncontribute to sustainable urban development (Resolution 23/4 on Sustainable\nUrban Development through Access to Public Spaces). Specifically, UN-Habitat is\nmandated:\n\nTo advance the agenda on place-making and\n     public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and international\n     approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\n     UN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces\n     and the quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange,\n     cooperation and research between partners working in this fieldTo develop a policy approach on the role\n     that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of our rapidly urbanizing\n     world, to disseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a\n     plan for ensuring its application internationally;To assist in coordinating UN-Habitat partners in\ndisseminating knowledge to existing sustainable urban development processes at\nall government levels.Globally,\nthe growing attention to\npublic space informed the 23rd Session of the Governing Council of\nThe United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in 2011, where\nmember states mandated UN-Habitat to consolidate agency-wide work on public\nspace, to develop and promote public space policy, coordination, disseminate\nknowledge and directly assist cities in public space initiatives.[1]\n\n\nAgainst this\nbackdrop, UN-Habitat established in 2012, a Global Programme on Public Space\nnow working in 30 cities. The world secretariat of the United Cities and Local\nGovernments (UCLG) has created a Strategic Planning Committee chaired by the\ncities of Porto Alegre and Durban with a strategic focus on global advocacy,\nestablishing regional networks of cities working on public space, supporting\nlearning exchanges, tool development and documenting good practices in\npartnership with UN-Habitat. The Italian Institute of Urbanism (INU) has been\ninstrumental in developing the Charter on Public Space as well as hosting the\npublic space biennale.\n\nAnother great\nmilestone which has been achieved is the adoption of the 2016-2030 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals which adopted a Goal 11 \u2018Build cities and human settlements\ninclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\u2019 One of the proposed targets set\nout is \u201cby 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible,\ngreen and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and\npersons with disabilities\u201d.\n\nThe adoption of\nthe SDG 11.7 by the General Assembly in September 2015, constituted the most\nsignificant attention ever to public space in the global policy arena. However, continued support for SDG 11,\nand in particular public space Target 11.7, will be even more important to\nensure adequate means of implementation and a sound monitoring framework that\nwill be necessary to catalyse action on public space as a contribution to\nsustainable cities and human settlements. This will require that cities invest\nin public space and in the spirit of the new urban agenda cities and local\ngovernments should take an integrated, trans-disciplinary approach by working\nin partnership with a range of stakeholders and organizations, including civil\nsociety, academia and the private sector to ensure inclusive, safe and\naccessible public spaces for all.\n\nIn 2013-15, the Future of\nPlaces (FoP) initiative significantly contributed to raising awareness around\nthe public space agenda on a global level. The FoP is a multi-stakeholder\ninitiative which was established by Ax:son Johnson Foundation, UN-Habitat and\nProject for Public Spaces (PPS) bringing together a large and diverse network\nof stakeholders around the issues of public space through a series of annual\nconferences (2013 in Stockholm, 2014 in Buenos Aires and 2015 in Stockholm\nagain). The Future of Places gathered leading global thinkers, academia,\ndecision-makers, practitioners, other UN Agencies, media, communities and\nprivate sector that subscribe to the transformative power that good quality\npublic spaces can have in a city. All together the network represents about\n1,500 individuals from 700 organisations, from 275 cities, across 100 countries. The success of this initiative has shown the\ncommitment of a wide range of actors with a stake in public space, as well as\nhighlighted the global importance of this theme. In a short time it has created\na global movement for public space (10.000 followers on twitter) contributing\nactively to highlighting its benefits and putting it on the global development\nagenda.UN-Habitat has worked in\nthe area of public space for over 15 years. However, at the 23rd Governing\nCouncil of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States asked UN-Habitat to\nplace a larger focus on public space and how it can contribute to sustainable\nurban development. Specifically, UN-Habitat is mandated: \n\n\n\na) To advance the agenda on\nplace-making and public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and\ninternational approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of\nUN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces and\nthe quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange, cooperation\nand research between partners working in this field; \n\n\n\nb) To develop a policy\napproach on the role that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of\nour rapidly urbanizing world, to\ndisseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a plan for\nensuring its application internationally;\n\nc) To assist in coordinating\nUN-Habitat partners in disseminating knowledge to existing sustainable\nurban development processes at all\ngovernment levels.\n\nThe project is\nalso aligned with the UN-Habitat Strategic Plan 2014-2019 and specifically to Sub-programme\n2: urban planning and design and expected\naccomplishment 2: integrated and\nparticipatory urban plans and public space for compact, inclusive and\nconnected cities.\n\nFor example, the project links with the\nfollowing UN-Habitat interventions:\n\n\u00b7\nUrban\nBasic Services: Sustainable Urban Transport in East African Cities (SUSTRAN)\nProgramme\n\n\u00b7\nParticipatory\nSlum Upgrading Programme (PSUP) \n\n\u00b7\nMunicipal\nSpatial Support Programme (MuSPP)\n\n\u00b7\nThe\nSafer Cities Programme\n\nUN\nHabitat is also a knowledge leader in the public space arena, developing tools\nand guidelines as well as contributing to global thinking through the Habitat\nIII issue papers, policy units, amongst others. Moreover, UN-Habitat has commenced several partnerships on the global\nbut also on the regional level focusing on issues related to public space. Therefore, UN-Habitat is perfectly\nplaced to take advantage of the opportunities presented by SDG11.7 on public\nspace and continue working on public space for the next four years.",

        "title": "Achieving Local Solutions To Displacement Crises In Somalia: A Human Security Approach To Durable Solutions",
        "description": "Human\nmobility should be considered in conjunction with the spatial repercussions\nthat population movements have on the locations affected by displacement. Over\nthe course of more than two decades of conflict, access to land, security of\ntenure and more broadly settlement\nhave become central issues affecting Somalia\u2019s security and stability going\nforwards; influencing the country\u2019s trajectory towards recovery and development\nin future; and ultimately playing a key role in establishing the foundations\nfor human security for displaced populations, returnees, other mobile groups\nand their hosts. \n\n\n\nIssues\nrelated to land tenure in Somalia are inextricably linked to voluntary and\nforced migration. Land is central to many different economic, social, cultural,\nenvironmental and political goals, making tenure security vital for peace and\nstability. Yet, land becomes a conflict driver when forms of dispossession take\nplace, or when rights to land use, access and transferability are violated. Any\ndisruptive or forcefully imposed change in how groups and individuals connect\nwith their land usually produces contentions, which may \u2013 and in Somalia did -\nresult in forms of organised violence. Conflict, natural disasters or rapid\nsocial and economic transformations (e.g. state formation, industrialization\nand urbanisation) trigger migrations that separate populations from their\nbelongings, assets, livelihoods and the cultural landmarks they identify with.\nHaving in place fair mechanisms to protect formal and customary rights to\naccess, use and transferability of land and regulate land use and allocation is\nessential to prevent outbreaks of conflict and violence.\n\n\n\nRegarding movements\nand dispossessions produced by conflict and natural disasters, in Somalia the\nnumber of internally displaced has almost tripled over the past ten years. The\nurban dimension of internal displacement is evident and corroborated by the\ntrends in rural to urban migration which has, over the past ten years, averaged\nrates of 4.1-4.5%. The relevance of cities in strengthening security,\nresponding to large population influxes and consolidating peace dividends is\nunquestionable. Yet, city expansion in major urban centres in Somalia is\nlargely unplanned and unregulated and land is arbitrarily redistributed.\nIncreased commercial interests have triggered large-scale investments, as well\nas construction works for commercial and residential structures. However, the\ntrickle-down effect of this renewed commercial interest is extremely limited.\nVulnerable populations hardly ever are in the position to harness the benefits\nof this rapid transformation. Displaced persons, returnees urban dwellers and\nurban poor are caught in a negative feedback loop, whereby the lack of\nregulation, good governance and law enforcement, exacerbates insecure access to\nland, exposure to violent land disputes and forcible eviction, as well as\nexclusion from public service delivery. This vulnerability and marginalization\ncontributes to pervasive fragility and conflict, In sum, nascent formal\ninstitutions are unequipped to equitably re-establish tenure units, and\ncustomary rights are often arbitrary and not accessible to \u201cidentity-defined\u201d\nstrangers - this would be the case of returnees and migrants who cannot access,\ncontrol and transfer land customary rights on the same grounds as local\ncommunities.\n\n\n\nThe recent\nannouncement by the government of Kenya expressing intention to repatriate\nSomali refugees has raised the already prominent issue to a critical level in\nsome areas. In the absence of a well-established legislative framework and law\nenforcement procedures for land, context appropriate, consensus based, and\nequitable solutions to land remain key establishing foundations for sustainable\nrecovery and stability. Conversely, the failure to address land issues,\nsecurity of tenure and sustainable housing could result in instability,\nconflict and the destitution of affected groups. \n\n\n\nThe multidimensional\naspect of community driven responses to instability and conflict mitigation\nrelated to mobility and housing, land and property as well as urban planning\nrequires a multi-agency approach, through which each agency will capitalize on\nits own experience and expertise. The International Organization for Migration\n(IOM) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) have the\nexpertise and mandates to support these locally owned processes in addressing\nmobility/displacement and space/urban planning. IOM, as the leading agency on\nmobility and migration, will utilize its experience in supporting community\ndriven approaches to respond to drivers of displacement and mitigate disputes\nrelated to mobility and movements, while UN-HABITAT, as the leading agency for\nurban planning and addressing issues related to space, including land, will\nemploy its expertise in supporting locally driven approaches to promote\nparticipatory urban planning, participatory settlement upgrading, resolve land disputes and map conflicts and\ndispute resolution mechanisms related to housing, land and property.\n\n\n\nGiven the scale of\nSomalia\u2019s population movements summarized above, geographic targeting through a\nfirst phase of support needs to be carefully considered and the following\ncriteria are used to prioritize targeting for this project. Firstly, areas\nimpacted by the return of Somalis from Dadaab refugee camp are prioritized for\nthis intervention. Whilst the number of IDPs by far exceeds the number of those\nreturning from Dadaab, the former are living in protracted situations of\ndisplacement and the latter will return over a short space of time. This\njustification is therefore based on the time critical impact that returns will\nhave in existing fragile contexts and the accompanying need to provide support\nat social, infrastructural and legislative levels. The second criterion is to\ntarget those areas highly impacted by internal displacement particularly those\nnot currently covered by existing interventions. When combined with the first\ntargeting, of areas being impacted by return, the following areas become an\nobvious priority. \n\n\n\n\n \n  \n  Location\n  \n  \n  Estimated IDP population\n  \n  \n  Estimated No. of returns based on intention\n  surveys[1]\n  \n  \n  Returnees from Dadaab to date\n  \n \n \n  \n  Kismayo\n  \n  \n  57,240[2] \n  \n  \n  39,723\n  \n  \n  4,873\n  \n \n \n  \n  Afmadow\n  \n  \n  54,984[3]\n  \n  \n  \n  2,085\n  \n  \n  1,347\n  \n \n \n  \n  Garbaharey\n  \n  \n  3,325\n  \n  \n  58\n  \n  \n  133\n  \n \n \n  \n  Baardheere\n  \n  \n  18,000\n  \n  \n  1,600\n  \n  \n  2,005\n  \n \n \n  \n  Bu\u2019ale\n  \n  \n  12,000\n  \n  \n  3,966\n  \n  \n  1,536\n  \n \n \n  \n  Sakow\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  2,181\n  \n  \n  2,004\n  \n \n \n  \n  Jamame\n  \n  \n  7,000\n  \n  \n  193\n  \n  \n  764\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nFor the funding from\nthe Human Security Trust Fund, the interventions will focus on Kismayo and\nAfmadow, while additional co-funding from other sources (Peacebuilding Fund,\netc.) will focus on other locations within Jubaland. Members of the joint\nprogramme currently have either an existing operational footprint or will\nexpand to these locations in the coming months which also supports the\nfeasibility of supporting interventions there.\nFurthermore, all of the above referenced locations have been identified as\npriority by the Federal Government Ministry of Interior and are therefore in\nline with government\u2019s current focus for the types of interventions proposed.",

        "description": "Support to the UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) country programme continues Finland's strong contribution for the development of Somalia's reproductive maternal and child health care services. UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

It builds on ongoing work to promote employment, decent work and income opportunities in Somalia. The project strategy draws on the findings of the review of the DWCP of Somalia (2014-2016), which among other issues, has pointed to the need for tailored capacity development interventions to enable workers and employers organizations to deliver services to their members and effectively engage in social dialogue. The project interventions will focus on: (i) addressing the youth employment challenges; (ii) creating a strong connection between humanitarian and development support; (iii) building on employment-intensive investment strategies; and (iv) integrating direct employment creation and skills and enterprise development for increased employability. The project is expected to provide opportunities for the ILO to leverage resources, expertise and synergies at the country level, notably through cooperation and collaboration within the UN system as well as with development partners. This project contributes to the country\u2019s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG targets 1.5 (Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters) and 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services).",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict. The funds received under DFID are to support activities under Outcome 2, in addition these activities are under \u2018Outcome 3: Sustainable local government investment vehicles are identified, designed and operated\u2019, in the Local Investment for Transformation in Somalia (LIFT-Somali) agreement with UNCDF.",

To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three out\nputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Local health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

        "description": "This Joint FGS-UN Programme aims to capitalise on recent security, governance and reconciliation achievements by expanding employment opportunities for young men and women, mainly in newly recovered areas. The programme recognizes the centrality of youth in fostering stability in the country and outlines specific interventions that can be taken within the next 24 months to begin to generate decent work opportunities for young people that will serve as positive alternatives to participation in violence and conflict. This will also contribute to the revitalization of the local economy. The programme will tackle youth at risk, unemployed and underemployed youth. The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months. The programme will initially be tailored for the first 24 months as per the Compact deadline (see also Table 1): \u2022 1: Improved long-term potential for growth, productivity and employment of at least three value chains in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector. \u2022 2: Equip 10,000 youth with basic literacy, numeracy and life-skills and sector-specific vocational and business training to enhance their employability to access sustainable job opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential. \u2022 3: Create 30,000 short-term jobs created through cash-for-work projects to rehabilitate productive infrastructure in target locations, mainly in newly recovered areas.",

This project seeks to unlock the potential of Somalia\u2019s renewable energy sector. Expanding energy access in the country has the potential to increase the productivity and competitiveness of Somali businesses, contribute to alleviating poverty (both of which could lead to increased investment), improve health and education outcomes, and bolster security. Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment gives women the independence, confidence, and ability to transform their lives. There is a direct correlation between improvements in health, education, peace, and security and the eventual success of women entrepreneurs to catalyse change within their regions, clans, towns, and families. Developing women\u2019s economic empowerment and renewable energy is critical in building wealth, creating jobs, and unleashing the potential for innovation that attracts investment and helps every nation develop.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

Older girls are likely to be already married. (2) Girls who have never enrolled in school, extremely vulnerable to early marriage or already adolescent wives and mothers. Most are involved in casual work and have limited time and interest to pursue regular education options. , the project will work with the government, communities and education providers to offer three tailored pathways for girls to access quality education over a period of 4 years: - An 11-month alternative basic education (ABE) course will enable young adolescents (girls and boys) who dropped out or have never been to school to reach a Grade 4 level, become fluent readers and fully numerate, and acquire basic life skills (financial literacy, leadership skills, communication and negotiation).",

        "description": "Access to good quality health care is largely problematic in Somalia due to prolonged war and political instability. About 26% of Somalia\u00b4s population live a nomadic life, and this significant group of about 4 million people is believed to have even less access to modern health care and health promotion than the rest of the population.This project aims to build up a network of knowledgeable researchers in Somalia, Kenya and Sweden to, together with representatives of the nomadic population and the Ministry of Health, build up a knowledge bank on nomadic health and health care access. The project will also develop a research application for deeper analysis of 1) central health problems to the nomad population, 2) obstacles to access health care, and 3) design and test interventions to create better access to both emergency care and elective care under the special living conditions of the nomadic population.The University of Gothenburg, KEMRI (Wellcome Trust funded health research program in Kenya) and Benadir University in Somalia are initiating this work but intend to join more partners over the next two years. During the project, three major workshops will be conducted in the relatively safe Hargeisa, Somaliland, and the database will be built by Benadir University.",

        "description": "Omprogrammerade medel f\u00f6r att bek\u00e4mpa covid-19\nDetta beslut \u00e4r ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till avtal med R\u00e4dda Barnens Riksf\u00f6rbund i Sverige (RBS) om bidrag till Programmet \"RBS humanit\u00e4ra arbete 2017-2019\". Programmet syftar till att m\u00f6ta barns humanit\u00e4ra behov och att skydda barn mot v\u00e5ld och f\u00f6rsummelse i humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer. Speciellt fokus i Programmet \u00e4r \"barn i v\u00e4pnade konflikter\". \n\nRBS \u00e4r en del av R\u00e4dda Barnen globalt (Save the Children International, SCI) som tillsammans har expertis f\u00f6r att svara p\u00e5 uppkomna krissituationer r\u00f6rande skydd av barn i n\u00e4ra samarbete med lokala partners. RBS \u00e4r en av f\u00e5 samarbetsparter till Sida som har ett fokus p\u00e5 skydd av barn och f\u00f6rankring av barns r\u00e4ttigheter i humanit\u00e4ra kriser. \n\nRBS \u00e4r en av Sidas tio-talet partnerorganisationer f\u00f6r humanit\u00e4rt bist\u00e5nd sedan 2013, d\u00e5 ett stort antal organisationer utv\u00e4rderades i syfte att ing\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre ramavtal med Sida f\u00f6r humanit\u00e4rt st\u00f6d. Sida utf\u00f6r \u00e5rligen en humanit\u00e4r allokeringsprocess som sedan ligger till grund f\u00f6r vilka organisationer, landprojekt och tematiska-/kapacitetsst\u00e4rkande projekt som ska beviljas finansiellt st\u00f6d. I enlighet med denna process, bed\u00f6mer Sida det relevant att under 2018 st\u00f6dja RBS humanit\u00e4ra Program i 6 l\u00e4nder, och att bidra med RRM-medel (Rapid Response Mechanism), samt st\u00f6dja ett antal tematiska-/kapacitetsst\u00e4rkande omr\u00e5den.\n\nSida har i huvudsak goda erfarenheter fr\u00e5n tidigare samarbete med RBS och dess humanit\u00e4ra insatser. Sida baserar detta p\u00e5 resultaten fr\u00e5n en extern utv\u00e4rdering (SIPU 2016), RBS resultatrapportering, samt Sidas f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljningar (som genomf\u00f6rts i 27 l\u00e4nder) under 2017. RBS har ocks\u00e5 minskat sin responstid f\u00f6r att svara p\u00e5 akuta krissituationer med drygt 50% (fr\u00e5n flera veckor till maximalt 4-7 dagar) under 2017. Detta har gjort att RBS kommer in snabbare \u00e4n ett flertal andra humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rer i kriser. Genom att slussa Sidas RRM-medel, efter godk\u00e4nnande av Sida, genom SCIs globala katastroffond, har detta blivit m\u00f6jligt, f\u00f6rst p\u00e5 pilotbasis under 2017, och fr\u00e5n 2018 p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt.\n\nUnder 2013 slutf\u00f6rdes en omstrukturering av R\u00e4dda Barnens organisation internationellt. Omorganisationens genomf\u00f6rande globalt har tagit tid och i vissa kontexter p\u00e5g\u00e5r den fortfarande. Den har f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat R\u00e4dda Barnens globala organisationsstruktur och styrning med syfte att harmonisera organisationens processer och system f\u00f6r att standardisera och kvalitetss\u00e4kra planering, programuppf\u00f6ljning, personals\u00e4kerhet, finansiell kontroll med mera. Viss finjustering med att synkronisera systemen inom organisationen globalt forts\u00e4tter, bl.a. inom RBS, under 2017-2019.\n\nSidas relevansbed\u00f6mning av de landspecifika projekten f\u00f6r 2018 och de tv\u00e5 fler\u00e5riga st\u00f6den f\u00f6r 2018 och 2019 baseras, som tidigare sagts, p\u00e5 en global behovsbed\u00f6mning som g\u00f6rs \u00e5rligen av Sida/HUM. Samtliga projekt har ocks\u00e5 granskats av relevanta geografiska handl\u00e4ggare p\u00e5 Sida/HUM samt av relevanta ambassader. Sida bed\u00f6mer att RBS i huvudsak uppn\u00e5r Sidas krav avseende f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntade resultat, men att RBS bl.a. beh\u00f6ver forts\u00e4tta f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra sin rapportering (inklusive resultatramverk med m\u00e4tbara m\u00e5l och tydlig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringsteori) till Sida f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en b\u00e4ttre resultatanalys. Under 2018 f\u00f6resl\u00e5r RBS ocks\u00e5 att forts\u00e4tta fokusera p\u00e5 vidareutveckling av kvalitetss\u00e4kring och uppf\u00f6ljning av landkontorens genomf\u00f6rande av insatserna. RBS kommer ocks\u00e5 att f\u00f6lja innovationsfonden, HIFs (Humanitarian Innovation Fund), arbete n\u00e4rmare under \u00e5ret. HIF kommer att p\u00e5b\u00f6rja aktiviteter igen med Sida-finansiering under 2018. Under 2017 utbetalades inga Sida-medel till HIF d\u00e5 resultaten fr\u00e5n en utv\u00e4rdering och revision av tidigare samarbete inv\u00e4ntades.

        "description": "Food insecurity is often both a cause and a consequence of humanitarian crisis. The ability of populations affected, or at risk, to maintain a reasonable supply of food and other agricultural production is a major component of saving lives and building resilience in many parts of the World, in particular in the Sahel and Horn of Africa. In the FAO Strategic Framework there is a specific Strategic Objective 5 \"Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crisis\" and most of the work done by the FAO Emergency and Rehabilitation Division (TCE) in support of the Humanitarian Response Plans is related to this strategic objective. FAO/TCE is the main channel for Sidas support to FAOs emergency activities.\nA new agreement was planned and negotiated with FAO/TCE for the period 2017-2019 and signed in March 2017.

        "title": "SRC Agreement 2017-2019",
        "description": "On January 27, 2017 the Swedish Red Cross (SRC) submitted an application to Sida for the above-mentioned program with an initial budget of 167.5 MSEK for 2017, 16 MSEK for 2018 and 16 MSK for 2019. The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises, and their capacity to recover afterwards, and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.\n\nFunds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments, after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017, following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 4,5 MSEK to13,5 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with, and Sida's approval of, additional applications for these contexts, and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. \n\nThe SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida's support to national societies, the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon, DR Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. \n\nThe SRC\u2019s strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC \u2013 is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC\u2019s new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does, however, put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation\u2019s application 2017-2019. Several programmes with a long-term development focus have been removed in the application for funding from Sida, and new initiatives with a sharper humanitarian focus have been included, such as Yemen and Cameroon (programme targeting CAR refugees). It will be important to follow up on this positive direction towards a strengthened humanitarian relevance to the Sida-funded projects to ensure its continuation.\n\nSupport planned for 2017 includes long-term programs in various fields such as health, disaster prevention, resilience, sanitation, organizational development, volunteer development and planning, monitoring, evaluation and results (PMER). The support also includes regional support to the IFRC\u2019s different cluster- and regional offices in Africa, Asia and MENA. Thematic- and capacity enhancement support will in 2017 focus on disaster reduction, volunteering in conflict and disaster, water and sanitation, health, and gender and diversity. Through support in the form of Sida's Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), the SRC will also be able to respond to rapid onsets of disasters. \n\nThe program proposal for 2017 includes:\nWEST- AND CENTRAL AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 1,3 MSEK\nCAMEROON: 2 MSEK\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nEAST- AND SOUTH AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 2,1 MSEK\nEAST AFRICA CLUSTER (Nairobi): 2,5 MSEK\nSOMALIA: 4 MSEK \nSOUTH SUDAN: 13,5 MSEK\nSUDAN: 4 MSEK\nASIA PACIFIC REGIONAL SUPPORT: 5,8 MSEK\nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nBANGLADESH: 6 MSEK\nDPRK: 4,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \nMENA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 4,3 MSEK\nIRAQ: 7 MSEK\nPALESTINE: 3 MSEK\nSYRIA INCLUDING Lebanon och Jordan: 30 MSEK \nYEMEN: 4,5 MSEK \nUKRAINE: 5 MSEK\nCAPACITY- OCH METHOD SUPPORT: 7,9 MSEK \nRRM-SUPPORT: 40 MSEK\nSUPPORT FOR THE DREF: 500 000 SEK \nSPECIAL INTERVENTIONS/ICRC DELEGATES: 3,6 MSEK\n\nThe program proposal for 2018 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nThe program proposal for 2019 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nOut of Sida's initial support for 2017 totalling 167.5 MSEK, 61.4 % (103.5 MSEK) will be channelled to the IFRC and 2.6 % (4,5 MSEK) to the ICRC. Approximately 5.5 % (9.3 MSEK) consists of projects that the SRC supports in consortia and where funds are allocated through partner NS such as British, Australian and Danish Red Cross. Approximately 8.9 % (15.0 MSEK) will be channelled directly to NS (e.g., DRC and Palestinian RC, further contributions go to a number of NS for the management of SRC delegates in-country costs). Approximately 21.6 % (36.3 MSEK) out of the total budget goes directly to the SRC, of which 14.8 % (25 MSEK) for staff costs (technical delegates and program officers) and 7 % to operational support costs (11.3 MSEK).",

LPI applying for support from Sida / Embassy in Nairobi for the program of which Sweden is funding 44% of the total budget 80 356 743 SEK. LPI has applied for EU funding through their call for proposals that are taking place during March 2017. LPI is applying for funding together with the Somali partner Somali Peace Line (SPL). LPI is currently investigating other potential donors. LPI has adjusted the current planning for 2017 to fit with the proposed support from Sida (and EU funds for CRM Phase II). The program is currently underfunded by 26%.\n\nThe head of the development cooperation with Somalia hereby makes a decision to divert from the requirement of bringing the appraisal for assessment in the Embassy common quality assurance committee QAC. Although the proposed budget exceeds the amount of 20MSEK that requires the intervention to be assessed in the embassy Committee, it is hereby decided to divert from this requirement based on Sida's good record of cooperation with LPI from the support of its Somalia program as well as global programs, as well as the time-pressured situation where funding to address the drought situation and famine should be given priority. The proposal, has however been taken up for discussion in the Somali Section's internal committee where it was assessed as highly relevant and with the recommendation that a decision to be taken on support.\n\nDue to the fact that Sweden's strategy for development cooperation with Somalia expires after 2017 and a new strategy is planned for the periode between 2018-2021, Sida is restricted to commit to funding for years beyond 2019. Consequently, Sida and LPI will enter into agreement for the period 2017-2019 with the option to extend the agreement with addition of funds for the year 2020.\n\nThe proposal also includes an integrated component of emergency aid to the ongoing and severe drought that hit the country in 2016 and continues to pose a threat in 2017. According to LPI, this response, with activities such as the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, job creation efforts, health nutritional packages, cholera prevention, hygiene training, food ration and the distribution of food parcels, knowledge about basic health program and services, strengthening social cohesion etc., constitutes a prerequisite to conduct the comprehensive peace building work in the areas that are the hardest hit by the drought. This initiative will run for three months and be reported separately (narrative, financial) in the first half-year reporting. LPI will forward 5,4MSEK to ZamZam Foundation (ZZF) for implementation of their drought response between April to June 2017.

        "description": "New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis is an intervention for the continued support of MSEK 475 to the \"UN Multi-Partnership Trust Fund\" (MPTF) for Somalia in 2018-2019. In Decision 2016-002435, dated 30 June 2015, Sida decided to support MPTF 2015-2017 with an amount of 140 MSEK. Following the decision 52/16 from November 2016, an additional 33 MSEK was added and an additional  55 MSEK through decision 14/17, dated April 24, 2017 and finally 10 MSEK was added in Dwecember 2017 through decision 58/2017. Sida assess that the MPTF and the joint programs that Sweden contributes to delivers results despite some challenges that comes with implementation of programmes in a difficult context.\n\nSomalia is one of the poorest countries in the world and is characterized by inequality. Recurrent humanitarian crises and armed conflicts pose challenging to the development of the country. Furthermore, Somalia is affected by climate change and recurring periods of drought. 2.3 million people have insecure food supplies and there are over one million internally displaced persons. Of a population of about 12 million, over 70% are poor and more than 40% live in extreme poverty. One of seven children dies before their first birthday; one of eighteen women die in childbirth; and only one in three persons have access to safe drinking water. Over 70% of Somalia's population is under thirty years and lack employment opportunities which leave many of them with few prospects for the future. Women are structurally discriminated and gender based violence is widespread. Somalia has the highest incidence of female genital mutilation in the world. Women also lack access to justice that can protect their interests. The lack of a formal and effective legal justice system in most parts of the country has led to extensive impunity. In 2017, Somalia was ranked as the most corrupt country in the world according to Transparency International.\n\nHowever, a relatively peaceful political process for state building has begun. The increasing international support in recent years has contributed to progress in many areas. The implementation of the indirect parliamentary election held in the fall of 2016 with increased political representation of women in addition to the presidential elections in February 2017 followed by a peaceful change of power are particularly positive signs.\n\nThe MPTF was established in 2015 with Sweden as one of the first donors. The fund currently manages a total of USD 200 million. The two biggest donors are the EU followed by UK. So far, Sweden has contributed with 238 MSEK during the period and is thereby the third largest donor to the fund. During the period 2015-2017, Sweden has supported the central political processes (elections, constitution, parliament and the new federal state formation), the development of the judiciary, job creation for young people, and public administration. Furthermore, Sweden has provided support to the UN's core functions to enable effective implementation in a challenging context like Somalia. In addition, pilot support for the fund's so-called \"national window\", to use Somalia\u2019s own country systems have been successfully supported to a prison rehabilitation facility, supplementing the above-mentioned legal aid program. Despite challenges on an overall level, it is Sida's assessment that these programs together deliver results.\n\nMoreover, Sida assess that the MPTF is now fully established and that the programmes that are funded are implemented satisfactory. The international community has made significant commitments. Somalia has developed a National Development Plan (NDP) for Somalia 2017-2019. In addition, a Security Pact was adopted at the Somalia Conference held in May 2017 in London. The Security Pact sets out the roadmap for a Comprehensive Approach to Security, CAS. Hence, the UN has developed its own strategic plan (UNSF) for Somalia that reflects both the NDP and CAS. The MPTF is the main funding mechanism for UN support the implementation on the UNSF.\n\nSida assess that the MPTF continues to be relevant and appropriate mechanism to deliver support. Based on Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Somalia and the new Strategy to come, Sida proposes that the continued support to the MPTF shall be earmarked for the following thematic areas and for the programs decided in the framework of these:\n1. Including policies, governance and federal state building, as well as reconciliation\n2. Human rights, women, peace and security\n3. Economic recovery and resilience\n4. Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights\n\nWithin the area of Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights, 140 MSEK will be earmarked to UNFPA\u2019s country programme for Somalia 2018-2020. For more information on the assessment of UNFPA as a strategic partner to Sida in Somalia, pleas se decision 28/2017, dated 2017-06-22. In addition, 60 MSEK shall be earmarked for the so-called \"Enablers Program\", which includes support for the UN Risk Management Unit, the UN department for Security, and the Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO), which is considered to be crucial for implementation of all development efforts in Somalia. \n\nHowever, the MPTF is not only a financing mechanism but also constitutes a platform for donor coordination in a broader sense since it includes the major actors such as the EU, UK, US, NO, DE, and DK. At the same time, there is a trend that the EU and the UK are launching new bilateral programs in certain areas, while other donors such as DE will expand their support in favor of the MPTF. The MPTF is an important and a key instrument for cooperation between the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia to realize the overall development goals of sustainable peace and development in Somalia.\n\nThe MPTF will harmonize and align the significant resources that are channeled through the UN in Somalia and as such it is foreseen to a more effective international support for Somalia. If the international community, the FSG and other stakeholders cooperate to reduce the risks, it is Sida's assessment that objectives will be reached to a reasonable extent despite the complex context and the many challenges it entails.\n\nThe draft agreement follows that between the UNDP and Sida agreed template for the current form of cooperation. The new standard Standard Administrative Arrangement, SAA will regulate Sweden's contribution to the MPTF. The SAA will be signed by Sida and UNDP as the administrative agent. A Terms of Reference for the MPTF as well as a Memorandum of Understanding between all implementation UN partners are attached. Sida\u2019s conditions in the contribution management rule are thereby fulfilled. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement has been signed between the Government of Somalia and UNDP as an administrative agent.",

        "description": "Somalia is ranked bottom in global indicators on gender inequality, maternal, reproductive and neonatal health and survival. One in 22 women dies every year due to pregnancy or childbirth related complications.  Neonatal deaths in children (i.e. deaths in children during the first 28 days of life) occur at a higher rate in Somalia than in any other country in the world (UNICEF 2016). Fertility in women is high with an average of 6.6 children per woman. At the same time, the incidence of gender-related violence among women including child marriages and forced marriage (more than 45 percent of girls under 18 years and one in 10 girls under 15 have been forced to marriages) and female gender mutilation (about 98 percent) are still high in the country. Women and girls have limited ability, if at all, to decide over their own bodies such when and whom to marry and when and how many children she wants and desires. Family planning still remains a difficult subject to openly discuss. Women seek these services in secrecy. \n\nUNFPA has after engagement by the embassy submitted a request to Sida for continued support to UNFPA:s country program document for the period 2011-2015, which has been formally extended until 31 December 2017. Focus for the CPD is on four key areas: 1) reproductive, maternal and neonatal health; 2) gender equality, with a special attention on SGBV; FGM and early marriage; 3) population data and statistiks; and 4) youh. Sweden has given support to UNFPA since 2014 within the framework of the previous joint health and nutrition program (JHNP) which ended in April 2017. Within the framework of JHNP, UNFPA has contributed to several important results, including: 1) training, quality assurance and registration of midwives; 2) maternal health services for pregnant women including increased access to modern contraception; 3) advocacy and community engagement in preventing female genital mutilation, child marriages, and violence against women; and 4) legal support towards for FGM and SGBV bill, both approved and adopted in Puntland region of Somalia while in federal government and in Somaliland the bills are awaiting parliament approval. UNFPA's work has a clear ownership of the Somali government and its federal administrations.\n\nIn addition to Sweden, UNFPA recieved new funding during 2017 from Finland, UK, Japan and Italy. Swedens longer-term support to UNFPA Somalia operations will be aligned with the new UNFPA Country Program Document (CPD) for the period 2018-2020, which is expected to be endorsed on the September board meeting in New York, and which will be part of the Swedens support to the UN Multi Partner Trust Fund Phase II which will be assessed during late autumn 2017.",

        "description": "Every year, tens of thousands of boys and girls are recruited and used by armed groups worldwide. This is happening despite international agreements to end the use of children under the age of 18 in armed conflicts. The issue was highlighted further through Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 in Agenda 2030 that among other things calls for immediate and effective measures to eradicate the worst forms of child labour, including the recruitment and use of childsoldiers. Despite these commitments, children are used in armed conflicts and countries are experiencing enormous challenges in convincing fighting parties to release children and find ways to reintegrate them into society. \n\nChildren who are released have often gone through traumatic experiences and are sometimes imprisoned or stigmatized by communities who see them as a continued threat. UNICEF works closely with its partners to avoid that children are separated from their families and has, through advocacy with armed groups since 2016, assisted with the release of 22 500 children out of which 11 300 children have been reintegrated with their communities. Among the activities are psychosocial support, support to continued education and activities that increase social cohesion and peacebuilding. \n\nIn situations of protracted conflicts, there are often gaps in financing when emergency aid through humanitarian assistance often needs to focus on more urgent needs and where development cooperation yet has not been established. Support to the release and reintegration of children formerly associated with armed groups needs extended funding to be sustainable. In order to build resilience against re-recruitment and strengthen young boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 engagement and participation in peacebuilding in support of social cohesion, the gaps that occur between humanitarian and development aid need to be bridged. UNICEF works to bridge this gap through \u2018The New Way of Working\u2019 and has identified the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Somalia as three countries where more than 50% of the children that have been released from armed groups yet are to receive support to socio-economic reintegration programmes. Sida\u2019s support therefore aims at bridging this gap within the three country contexts in order to assist UNICEF in its work to release and reintegrate children in a more sustainable way. \nThe long-term goal of the intervention is \u201cTo contribute to ending and preventing grave violations committed against children in armed conflict, including the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups, and to supporting the release and reintegration of these children\u201d.",

        "title": "UNCDF LMF-Booster 2019-2022",
        "description": "The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) is the UN\u2019s capital investment agency for the world\u2019s 47 Least Developed Countries (LDCs). UNCDF uses its capital mandate to help LDCs pursue inclusive growth through financing inclusive financial systems and by facilitating access to capital for e.g. climate resilence investments. UNCDF is affiliated to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and is included by their processes, policies and regulations.\n\nThe UNCDF activities are performed through two main pillars: Financial Inclusion and Local Development Finance. A third, method-based pillar called the LDC Investement Platform (LDCIP) has recently been established to provide alternative financial instruments such as loans and guarantees, utilizing the UNCDF's previously given mandate. This development is significant for the contribution, as UNCDF's ecosystem approach, utilizing blended finance i.e. a mix of different forms of financial instruments as well as partners, make them unique. It also makes UNCDF a strategic partner for Sida within the field of innovative financing in relation to both economically and environmentally sustainable development, working for economic transformation in LDCs. \n\nThe UNCDF, together with local partners, identifies and developes a financial product or service, e.g. an innovation related to micro-credits or climate finance. UNCDF contributes to the development of the product through technical assistance, grants, loans, a guarantee, or a mixture of instruments. From that point, other actors, such as banks or a local authority, can take the product further and scale it up. The model means that UNCDF together with local actors identifies bankable projects (1), the project receives grants and/or TA to further develop the innovation (2), UNCDF extends a loan/guarantee (3),  and finally UNCDF refers the project for co-investment or to a commercial actor (4). This approach takes its point of departure from the assumption that UNCDF acts as a front runner that can pave the way for other actors with bigger potential for upscaling, through UNCDF taking risks that commercial or public actors would not be willing to do, inspiring a behavioral and systems change. By doing so, UNCDF is in a position for building a pipeline of investment-ready projects that have been de-risked and can financed and upscaled by commercial or public capital. \n\nThe Contribution includes The Last Mile Finance Trust Fund (LMFTF) which includes the finance mechanism The Booster Fund as well as the programme Better than Cash Alliance (BtCA) which is hosted by UNCDF. The total sum of the intervention is 189 million SEK to be disbursed during the period 2019-2021, including an annual contribution of 8 million SEK to BtCA.\n\nThrough LMFTF, UNCDF acts to make  financial products such as savings, credits, insurance, payments and remittances available for the excluded and un-banked as well as to small and medium sized companies to a reasonable cost in a sustainable way. The fund's activities are performed through approximately 10 programs within 5 thematic areas (Green Economy, Food Security/Nutrition, Economic Empowerment for Women/Youth, Infrastructure and Financial Inclusion/Innovation) The programs have strong connections within these thematic areas but also between these. The programs are typically active in a number of countries, combined with a normative frame.\n\nWithin the framework of LMFTF there are multiple programs:\n- CleanStart, a program with the goal of providing 500 000 people with clean energy solutions (e.g. solar panels, mini grids, clean cooking stoves) through investments\n- Making Access Possible, an initiative to support financial inclusion through analysis and road mapping\n- DF+, which creates digital financial solutions for innovations which contribute to the SDGs \n- MicroLead, a global initiative that challenges financial service actors to develop, test and upscale deposit services for people with low incomes, especially rural women\n- The Finance for Food Security, which works for food security and against malnutrition through encouraging local, gender sensitive investments to fill the gaps of the local food system\n- IELD, which works with central and local governments to build capacity for gender responsive economic policy and seeks to identify hindrances for female participation in economic activity \n- Municipal Investments Finance, which supports municipalities in inproving the access to finance services, focusing on secondary cities within LDCs, as opposed to merely capital cities. \n\nThe Booster Fund is a mechanism under LMFTF through which UNCDF contributes with capital as well as technical assistance to both the private and public sector, with the purpose of strengthening their capacities for planning, budgeting and financing small scale infrastructure contributing to strengthened resilience in relation to climate change. Sida is the only finansier of this mechanism but programs under The Booster Fund is funded at bilateral level. The goal is to reduce poverty by \"boosting\" structural transformation of local economic systems by building environmental resilience and sustainability. Through the Booster Fund, UNCDF has through technical assistance and grants built a pipeline of projects ready for investments and upscaling.\n\nProgrammes within the Booster Fund (also par of the overall LMFTF umbrella):\n- Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL), which works with integrating climate adaption in local governments' planning and budgeting\n- EcoBonds, seeking to emit bonds on a municipal level for investments contributing to resilience\n- Local Finance Initiative (LFI), which seeks to establish local development units within the central administration of Tanzania and Uganda, supporting local development investments\n- CleanStart, a program with the goal of providing 500 000 people with clean energy solutions through investments\n\nThe third component, an independent program that is hosted by UNCDF \u2013 Better than Cash Alliance (BtCA) \u2013 is an alliance of countries and multi-national companies active in the digitalisation of payments. The purpose of BtCA is to enable digital payment solutions in order to build an including digital economy that contributes to the SDGs.\n\nTo exemplify UNCDF's work, in Bangladesh a UNCDF project developed models for participatory decision making on climate adaptive and resilient investments in local infrastructure. Successful pilot projects lead to the national government giving their support to the project, funding it and propelling the program to the degree that it was not possible for UNCDF to further house the project. In the third phase now running the entire country is covered by this support, where UNCDF's technical assistance ensures a focus on poverty, gender equality, and auditing, and helps strengthen administrative systems for monitoring and evaluation. In this case, UNCDF managed to leverage their funds so that eventually the World Bank took up the project, contributing a funding total of 72 times the original funding by UNCDF. This is illustrative of how UNCDF can lead systems change at a local and national level. \n\nAs an example of BtCA's work the government of Ethiopia has requested the Alliance to support the development of the National Digital Payments Strategy in order to accelerate the government\u2019s plans to digitize payments and the economy.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, the final goal of the intervention is to create including, equal and resilient financial markets and local financial systems that are more efficient in their ability to strengthen poor people, SMEs and local governments in the least developed countries.",

Organisationens huvudmandat ligger inom livr\u00e4ddande insatser som syftar till att utrota f\u00f6rekomsten av hunger genom att f\u00f6rebygga, uppt\u00e4cka och behandla undern\u00e4ring, samt att bem\u00f6ta de underliggande orsakerna till hunger.  \n\nAAH bed\u00f6ms av Sida ha en viktig expertis och kompetens inom den humanit\u00e4ra verksamheten att arbeta med fr\u00e5gor kring nutrition och sektorer i dess n\u00e4ra anslutning s\u00e5som livsmedelsf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten och sanitet samt h\u00e4lsa. AAH arbetar med de mest utsatta grupperna i m\u00e5nga av de stora humanit\u00e4ra kriserna.

Sida har goda erfarenheter av AAH:s f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att snabbt svara p\u00e5 behov till f\u00f6ljd av pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt eskalerande kriser.\n\nAAH:s merv\u00e4rde som humanit\u00e4r partnerorganisation till Sida ligger i organisationens huvudmandat inom omr\u00e5det f\u00f6r nutrition, vilket kan p\u00e5visas genom att AAH: \n\nA.\tHar etablerad n\u00e4rvaro i majoriteten av v\u00e4rldens humanit\u00e4ra kriser. Med tre regionala kontor, 50 landkontor och totalt 8 000 medarbetare har AAH f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna, samt kapaciteten, att bist\u00e5 m\u00e4nniskor som \u00e4r i behov av st\u00f6d. \n\nB.\tTack vare sin etablerade n\u00e4rvaro, snabbt kan n\u00e5 ut till m\u00e4nniskor vid pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra kriser.

AAH:s snabba responskapacitet kunde bland annat ses i insatser som svarade upp mot humanit\u00e4ra behov kopplade till evakueringen av Mosul, Irak, 2017 samt vid den hastigt eskalerande flyktingstr\u00f6mmen fr\u00e5n Norra Rakhine, Myanmar, till Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, under slutet av 2017. \n\nC.\tVid implementeringen av insatser ofta anv\u00e4nder sig av en integrerad ansats, d\u00e4r undern\u00e4ringsproblematiken per kontext analyseras grundligt f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla en effektiv humanit\u00e4r respons. Insatser som syftar till att minska f\u00f6rekomsten av undern\u00e4ring, integrerar ofta, ut\u00f6ver medicinsk behandling med n\u00e4ringstillskott, komponenter inom livsmedelf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten, sanitet och h\u00e4lsa samt psykosocialt st\u00f6d.

Allokeringsprocessen utmynnar i att de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utv\u00e4ljs, vilket bland annat baseras p\u00e5 organisationernas relevans och effektivitet enligt iakttagelser fr\u00e5n tidigare f\u00e4ltuppf\u00f6ljning. Det nu aktuella st\u00f6det till Action Against Hunger (AAH) baseras p\u00e5 Sidas humanit\u00e4ra allokeringsprocess, som f\u00e4rdigst\u00e4lldes under slutet av 2017. \n\nAktuell insats bygger vidare p\u00e5 tidigare \u00e5rs st\u00f6d till AAH, som tidigare gick under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF). Sidas \u00e5rliga st\u00f6d till AAH bef\u00e4stes 2014 d\u00e5 ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett tre\u00e5rigt avtal, signerades. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6regicks av en djupdykande utv\u00e4rdering, vilken bland annat framlyfte AAH:s goda expertis och renomm\u00e9 inom nutritionsomr\u00e5det. Det tre\u00e5riga avtalet f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngdes senare f\u00f6r att \u00e4ven inkludera 2017. Ett nytt tre\u00e5rigt avtal (2018-2020) f\u00f6resl\u00e5s nu f\u00f6r att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra en fortsatt strategisk ansats i relation och partnerskap med AAH.

Detta \u00e4r en st\u00f6dform som ger AAH m\u00f6jlighet att flexibelt allokera st\u00f6det till ej f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda humanit\u00e4ra behov inom l\u00e4nderna. Detta under f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttning att insatserna faller inom l\u00e4ndernas respektive FN-ledda humanit\u00e4ra responsplaner samt de programdokument AAH har inkommit med till Sida. \n\n3.\tRAPID RESPONSE MECHANISM. Av den initiala allokeringen utg\u00f6r 35 miljoner kronor st\u00f6d i form av modellen Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), vilket ger AAH flexibilitet att snabbt tillskjuta medel till nya insatser som syftar till att besvara pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, och f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra behov.

AAH har sedan dess vuxit kontinuerligt, och utg\u00f6r i dag en av de st\u00f6rsta humanit\u00e4ra akt\u00f6rerna inom sitt huvudmandat; det vill s\u00e4ga, nutrition och mats\u00e4kerhet. Action Against Hunger gick tidigare under namnet Action Contre La Faim (ACF), men valde att byta namn f\u00f6r att s\u00e4tta en mer internationell pr\u00e4gel p\u00e5 organisationen.\n\nUnder 1990-talet utvecklade AAH ett internationellt n\u00e4tverk, vars styrelse i dag best\u00e5r av medlemmarna AAH Frankrike (Sidas avtalspartner), AAH Indien, AAH Kanada, AAH Spanien, AAH Storbritannien och AAH USA. AAH:s internationella n\u00e4tverk delar en strategisk plan, och medlemmarna har gemensamt framtagit en rad principer, som till exempel neutralitet, transparens och icke-diskriminering, vilka de alla lyder under. Tillsammans har de ocks\u00e5 utarbetat ett gemensamt f\u00f6rh\u00e5llningss\u00e4tt till bland annat anti-korruptionsfr\u00e5gor. P\u00e5 medlemsniv\u00e5 har detta \u00f6versatts till separata anti-korruptionspolicys samt uppf\u00f6randekoder (code of conducts), som tillsammans med sina annex fastst\u00e4ller n\u00e4tverksmedlemmarnas nolltolerans mot sexuella \u00f6vergrepp och maktmissbruk.

Med tre regionala kontor, 50 landkontor och totalt 8 000 medarbetare har AAH f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna, samt kapaciteten, att bist\u00e5 m\u00e4nniskor som \u00e4r i behov av st\u00f6d. \n\nB.\tTack vare sin etablerade n\u00e4rvaro, snabbt kan n\u00e5 ut till m\u00e4nniskor vid pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna, eller kraftigt f\u00f6rv\u00e4rrade, humanit\u00e4ra kriser. AAH har, genom redan anst\u00e4lld personal, m\u00f6jlighet att vid humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer snabbt uts\u00e4nda personal, med gedigen erfarenhet av liknande krissituationer, som st\u00f6d till ber\u00f6rda landkontor. AAH:s snabba responskapacitet kunde bland annat ses i insatser som svarade upp mot humanit\u00e4ra behov kopplade till evakueringen av Mosul, Irak, 2017 samt vid den hastigt eskalerande flyktingstr\u00f6mmen fr\u00e5n Norra Rakhine, Myanmar, till Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, under slutet av 2017. \n\nC.\tVid implementeringen av insatser ofta anv\u00e4nder sig av en integrerad ansats, d\u00e4r undern\u00e4ringsproblematiken per kontext analyseras grundligt f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla en effektiv humanit\u00e4r respons. Insatser som syftar till att minska f\u00f6rekomsten av undern\u00e4ring, integrerar ofta, ut\u00f6ver medicinsk behandling med n\u00e4ringstillskott, komponenter inom livsmedelf\u00f6rs\u00f6rjning, vatten, sanitet och h\u00e4lsa samt psykosocialt st\u00f6d. P\u00e5 s\u00e5 vis kan mer l\u00e5ngsiktiga och h\u00e5llbara l\u00f6sningar n\u00e5s. \n\nAAH:s n\u00e4tverksmedlemmar \u00e4r i regel direktimplementerande. Samtidigt har de f\u00f6r avsikt att, inom ramen f\u00f6r Grand Bargains lokaliseringsagenda, senast 2020 implementera 20 % av sina insatser genom lokala partnerorganisationer. AAH \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 en viktig partnerorganisation till FN, d\u00e4r AAH implementerar insatser med finansiellt och materiellt st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n bland annat UNICEF. \n\nSida \u00e4r f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande, fr\u00e5nsett FN och EU, AAH:s tredje st\u00f6rsta givare, efter USA och Storbritannien. F\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna bed\u00f6ms d\u00e4rmed goda att framgent bygga vidare p\u00e5 en redan etablerad dialog, d\u00e4r Sida har m\u00f6jlighet att lyfta fr\u00e5gor som \u00e4r av stor vikt f\u00f6r Sida.\n\nUnder de f\u00f6rsta tre \u00e5ren (2014-2016) av Sidas tidigare strategiska partnerskapsavtal med AAH, har bland annat f\u00f6ljande resultat uppn\u00e5tts genom Sidas finansiering: \n\nUNDERN\u00c4RING \nDrygt 250 000 akut undern\u00e4rda barn har mottagit behandling i form av n\u00e4ringstillskott. \n\nH\u00c4LSA\nN\u00e4rmare 120 000 m\u00e4nniskor p\u00e5verkade av humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer har en f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till h\u00e4lsokliniker. \u00d6ver 40 000 barn mellan 6 m\u00e5nader till 15 \u00e5r har vaccinerats mot m\u00e4sslingen. \n\nVATTEN OCH SANITET\nCirka 855 000 m\u00e4nniskor p\u00e5verkade av humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer har f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till rent vatten. \n\nMAT\nN\u00e4stan 50 000 m\u00e4nniskor p\u00e5verkade av humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer har mottagit st\u00f6d i form av mat. \n\nF\u00d6RS\u00d6RJNINGSM\u00d6JLIGHETER\n78 000 hush\u00e5ll/m\u00e4nniskor p\u00e5verkade av humanit\u00e4ra krissituationer har mottagit st\u00f6d som syftar till att st\u00e4rka deras f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjningsm\u00f6jligheter. \n\nSom specifikt landexempel kan Jemen omn\u00e4mnas, d\u00e4r AAH under ett ett\u00e5rigt projekt, vilket avslutades i april 2017, s\u00e4kerst\u00e4llde att \u00f6ver 38 000 m\u00e4nniskor fick f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till rent vatten.  \n\n**********\n\nSida bed\u00f6mer att samtliga medel f\u00f6r 2018 ska utbetalas omg\u00e5ende.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga.

V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5.

Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn.

Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur.

AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker.

Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation.

Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r.

F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur.

AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker.

Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare.

Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia.

Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur.

AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker.

Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat st\u00f6d till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015\u2013002435 och 2018\u2013001376). AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker. V\u00e4rldsbankens strategi har tv\u00e5 fokusomr\u00e5den (1) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster och (2) f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkta ekonomiska m\u00f6jlighet och motst\u00e5ndskraft. Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi. V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia.

V\u00e4rldsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas f\u00f6rslag till ny finansiering uppg\u00e5r till st\u00f6d under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt st\u00f6d till nuvarande MPF-program p\u00e5 75 miljoner kronor f\u00f6r 2018. Beroende p\u00e5 om och n\u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken lyckas s\u00e4kra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om V\u00e4rldsbanken justerar nuvarande planer f\u00f6r resultat inom h\u00e4lsoomr\u00e5det i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att \u00f6verv\u00e4ga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.\n\nF\u00f6r att reglera Sidas insats till V\u00e4rldsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) f\u00f6r Somalia 2018\u20132021, anv\u00e4nder Sida och V\u00e4rldsbanken den avtalsmall som \u00f6verenskommits i december 2016 av r\u00e5dgivande gruppen om Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. Det \u00e4r viktigt f\u00f6r Sida att anv\u00e4nda den nya mallen eftersom den tydligg\u00f6r mycket av det reformarbete som V\u00e4rldsbanken tillsammans med andra givare bedrivit i CGOP. \n\nI f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till den tidigare beslutade mallen har f\u00f6ljande till\u00e4gg gjorts i den nya mallen (se beslut nr 2016-004174): \n- Information om resultatramverk och budget ska finnas p\u00e5 V\u00e4rldsbankens webbsida.\n- V\u00e4rldsbanken ska f\u00f6rebygga, vidta \u00e5tg\u00e4rder avseende samt informera om korruption.\n- Givare har r\u00e4tt att inneh\u00e5lla medel vid avtalsbrott.\n- Avtalets sekretessklausul f\u00e5r inte strida mot givares lagstigningen om offentlighet och sekretess. \n\nEnligt \u00f6verenskommelsen fr\u00e5n december 2016 ska den nya avtalsmallen anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r nya fonder eller n\u00e4r alla givare \u00e4r \u00f6verens om att \u00f6verg\u00e5 till den nya avtalsmallen. Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r. D\u00e4remot kommer den externa rapporteringen fortfarande vara en konsoliderad MPF rapport. Detta till trots, bed\u00f6mer Sida att den nya avtalsmallen b\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndas d\u00e5 den b\u00e4ttre \u00f6verensst\u00e4mmer svensk lagstiftning och Sidas arbetss\u00e4tt. Sida avser \u00e4ven att f\u00f6ra en dialog med \u00f6vriga givare om en \u00f6verg\u00e5ng till MPF Phase 2. F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Sverige och andra givare har beg\u00e4rt till\u00e4mpning av den nya mallen f\u00f6r nya bidrag till Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPF). \n\nF\u00f6r att tillgodose Sveriges beg\u00e4ran har V\u00e4rldsbanken beslutat att \u00f6ppna en ny fond, the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund Phase 2. V\u00e4rldsbanken har p\u00e5talat att det f\u00f6r banken kommer att inneb\u00e4ra \u00f6kad intern administration och viss effektivitetsf\u00f6rlust under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r.

F\u00f6rhoppningsvis kan den ursprungliga fonden fasas ur om \u00f6vriga givare ansluter sig till MPF Phase 2. D\u00e4rmed skulle den \u00f6kade administrationen och effektivitetsf\u00f6rlusten begr\u00e4nsas till en \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsperiod. \n\nV\u00e4rldsbanken \u00e4r \u00f6vergripande ansvarig f\u00f6r genomf\u00f6randet men modaliteten i sig inneb\u00e4r att 80-85% av MPF-projekten kommer att genomf\u00f6ras av mottagande parter. Det betyder att stora delar av finansieringen till MPF kommer att kanaliseras genom den federala regeringen i Somalia och federala medlemsstater. Riskerna med att anv\u00e4nda de nationella systemen i Somalia betraktas som h\u00f6ga. Att dessa anv\u00e4nds maximerar dock effektiviteten av st\u00f6det och kan dessutom st\u00e4rka regeringens legitimitet och st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n offentligheten genom f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt ansvarsutkr\u00e4vande mellan staten och dess medborgare. V\u00e4rldsbanken har inte ett landskontor i Mogadishu \u00e4nnu men \u00f6kar gradvis sin n\u00e4rvaro i Somalia. \u00c4ven om bankens n\u00e4rvaro i landet \u00e4r begr\u00e4nsad, har V\u00e4rldsbanken ett n\u00e4ra samarbete med de somaliska myndigheterna, b\u00e5de p\u00e5 nationell och subnationell niv\u00e5. V\u00e4rldsbanken uppdrar \u00e5t en s.k. third-Party Monitoring Agent att st\u00f6dja och \u00f6vervaka bankens projekt som del av riskidentifiering och riskhantering. Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbankens f\u00f6rsta strategi f\u00f6r Somalia p\u00e5 30 \u00e5r och signalerar ett f\u00f6rnyat f\u00f6rtroende hos V\u00e4rldsbanken avseende Somalias \u00e5tagande f\u00f6r landets utveckling. V\u00e4rldsbankens CPF finansieras f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande av 10 givare genom st\u00f6d till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) f\u00f6r implementering. Sverige \u00e4r fj\u00e4rde st\u00f6rsta bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten inneb\u00e4r en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket \u00e4ven \u00e4r den finansieringsform som f\u00f6redras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF \u00e4r en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inr\u00e4ttats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och \u00e5teruppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av V\u00e4rldsbanken i n\u00e4ra samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga v\u00e4l i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar v\u00e4l den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att \u00e5terspegla planens samtliga \u00e5tta pelare. Sida bed\u00f6mer att MPF har en h\u00f6g grad av nationellt \u00e4gandeskap och \u00e4r v\u00e4l anpassad till \u00f6vriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som f\u00f6rvaltare av fonden \u00e4r V\u00e4rldsbanken \u00f6vergripande ansvarig, vilket inneb\u00e4r att tillg\u00e4ngliga medel liksom vidaref\u00f6rmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. \n\nMPF har ett specifikt fokus p\u00e5 st\u00f6d till statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, socioekonomisk \u00e5terh\u00e4mtning och h\u00e5llbar utveckling j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med FN:s Somaliafond som \u00e4r mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar p\u00e5 rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur.

AfDB-fonden b\u00f6rjade 2017 men Sida ger inte st\u00f6d till denna. \n\nDet \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let med CPF 2019-2022 \u00e4r att l\u00e4gga grunden f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt. Fokus \u00e4r p\u00e5 prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5ller landets nuvarande s.k. \"dual development trap\", vilken best\u00e5r av en l\u00e5g grad av tillit som f\u00f6rst\u00e4rks av utbredd s\u00e5rbarhet till f\u00f6ljd av \u00e5terkommande chocker.

Det f\u00f6rsta fokusomr\u00e5det kommer att inneb\u00e4ra fortsatt st\u00f6d till p\u00e5g\u00e5ende satsningar inklusive nytt fokus p\u00e5 finanspolitiskt utrymme och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till samt kvalitet p\u00e5 viktiga samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas p\u00e5 reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursf\u00f6rdelning, tillg\u00e5ng till grundl\u00e4ggande sociala tj\u00e4nster och resiliens. Det andra fokusomr\u00e5det syftar till att st\u00e4rka landets ekonomiska motst\u00e5ndskraft som grund f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillv\u00e4xt genom att f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningarna f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagande och \u00f6kade m\u00f6jligheter f\u00f6r marknadstilltr\u00e4de, \u00f6kad tillg\u00e5ng till kapital f\u00f6r finansiell inkludering, \u00f6kad grad av digitalisering, samt f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad tillg\u00e5ng till vatten och f\u00f6rnybar energi.

Denna funktion kan \u00e4ven anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge riktat st\u00f6d till regeringen i syfte att bygga upp och st\u00e4rka deras offentliga finansiella management system. Det \u00e4r Sidas bed\u00f6mning att V\u00e4rldsbanken har de rutiner, resurser och kompetens som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att s\u00e4kerst\u00e4lla god intern finansiell uppf\u00f6ljning och kontroll. \n\nSomalia har gjort stora framsteg inom reformering av statens k\u00e4rnfunktioner, s\u00e5som inr\u00e4ttandet av Somalia Financial Management Information System; funktionaliteter f\u00f6r allokering av skatteint\u00e4kter mellan den federala regeringen och de federala medlemsstaterna liksom en f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt Centralbank. Hittills har regeringen framg\u00e5ngsrikt genomf\u00f6rt tv\u00e5 Staff Monitored Programs (SMP I och II) och inlett ett tredje SMP. Somalia anses idag vara ber\u00e4ttigad till skuldsanering inom HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country) initiativet givet landets oh\u00e5llbara skuldniv\u00e5er. MPF visar ett bra \u201dtrack record\u201d och resultat som indikerar att det finns positiva orsakssamband mellan MPF-programmen och de framsteg som Somalia har gjort sedan etableringen av fonden. MPF-portf\u00f6ljen har bidragit till viktiga reformer s\u00e5som makroekonomisk stabilitet och att bygga \u201dtrack record\u201d f\u00f6r dialog om skuldl\u00e4ttnad. Det finns evidens att potentiell tillg\u00e5ng till IFI-finansiering (International Financial Institutions) p\u00e5 relativt kort sikt och eventuell skuldl\u00e4ttnad p\u00e5 l\u00e4ngre sikt skapar starka incitament f\u00f6r reformering, s\u00e4rskilt inom ett lands offentliga finansiella f\u00f6rvaltning. MPF-st\u00f6d f\u00f6r privatsektorutveckling har varit avg\u00f6rande f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsreformering och \u00f6kad grad av engagemang fr\u00e5n den privata sektorn. Utvecklingen av den somaliska privata sektorn \u00e4r n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r Somalias fred och v\u00e4lst\u00e5nd och regeringen liksom givarna beh\u00f6ver arbeta n\u00e4ra tillsammans med den privata sektorn f\u00f6r prioriteringar att st\u00e4rka ekonomiska tillv\u00e4xt. Utmaningarna f\u00f6r Somalia \u00e4r fortfarande omfattande p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga omr\u00e5den, s\u00e5som st\u00e4rkande av makroekonomiska f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar, genomf\u00f6rande av viktiga \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r att \u00f6ka landets skatteint\u00e4kter, genomf\u00f6rande av prioriterade lagar, etablerande av politisk konsensus om en federal modell och f\u00f6rst\u00e4rkt kapacitet hos nationell f\u00f6rvaltning.\n\n\u00d6vergripande riskbed\u00f6mning:\nV\u00e5ld och v\u00e4pnad konflikt samt politisk instabilitet \u00e4r n\u00e5gra av de st\u00f6rsta hindren f\u00f6r ekonomisk och social utveckling i Somalia. Bortsett fr\u00e5n politisk instabilitet och stor s\u00e4kerhetsutmaning, befinner sig Somalia i en sv\u00e5r humanit\u00e4r situation. Klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och \u00e5terkommande perioder av torka p\u00e5verkar befolkningen g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng och motst\u00e5ndskraften \u00e4r l\u00e5g efter \u00e5rtionden av konflikt och instabilitet.

Det finns inget s\u00e5dant initiativ f\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande i Somalia. Etablering av ett effektivt HMIS \u00e4r inkluderat i WHO:s sex grundl\u00e4ggande byggstenar f\u00f6r h\u00e4lso- och sjukv\u00e5rdssystem. Nuvarande fragmentering och brist p\u00e5 data och information g\u00f6r det sv\u00e5rt om inte om\u00f6jligt f\u00f6r Somaliska h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdsakt\u00f6rer att kostnadseffektivt planera, hantera och leverera kvalitetsh\u00e4lsov\u00e5rd \u00f6ver hela landet. Insatsen skall implementeras av SPIDER (Swedish Program for ICT in Developing Regions). SPIDER grundades 2004 p\u00e5 Sidas initiativ och \u00e4r idag ett oberoende centrum f\u00f6r expertis inom ICT f\u00f6r utveckling vid Stockholms Universitet. Sida har sedan etableringen av SPIDER fortsatt att tillhandah\u00e5lla ett fler\u00e5rigt icke-\u00f6ronm\u00e4rkt/k\u00e4rnst\u00f6d till SPIDER i till\u00e4gg till specifika projekt st\u00f6d. SPIDER fungerar som den svenska operativa motparten och r\u00e5dgivaren f\u00f6r ett antal Sida ICT f\u00f6r utveckling (ICT4D) projekt i Sida prioriterade l\u00e4nder. SPIDER mobiliserar ett n\u00e4tverk av svenska och internationella experter p\u00e5 informations- och kommunikationsteknik f\u00f6r utveckling f\u00f6r att hj\u00e4lpa utvecklingsl\u00e4nder anv\u00e4nda ICT som ett verktyg f\u00f6r att effektivt och strategiskt driva utvecklings- och fattigdomsminskningsm\u00e5l - i detta fall, h\u00e4lsa.\n\nF\u00f6r denna insats, f\u00f6resl\u00e5r SPIDER en initial 12-m\u00e5naders start-fas under vilken SPIDER kommer att genomf\u00f6ra granskning av nuvarande data och informationssituationen och kapaciteten i Somalia, analys av regionala behov, inklusive bed\u00f6mning av h\u00e4lsosystemet i de tv\u00e5 utvalda regionerna (Galmudug och Puntland ), rekrytering och utstationering av projektpersonal och kartl\u00e4ggning av relevanta akt\u00f6rer. De tv\u00e5 utvalda regionerna best\u00e4mdes av SPIDER i samr\u00e5d med det federala h\u00e4lsoministeriet i Somalia. De tv\u00e5 utvalda regionerna \u00e5terspeglar det nuvarande h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdssystemet i Somalia. Galmudug-regionen representerar ett av de svagaste h\u00e4lsosystemen med begr\u00e4nsad kapacitet och r\u00e4ckvidd. Galumudug-regionen kontrolleras ocks\u00e5 delvis av Al-Shabaab som g\u00f6r det sv\u00e5rt att f\u00e5 tillg\u00e5ng till kritisk m\u00f6dra-och barnh\u00e4lsov\u00e5rd. Puntland regionen \u00e5 andra sidan har ett av de mest utvecklade h\u00e4lsosystemen inom Somalias federala regering. Regionen \u00e4r ganska stabil och h\u00e4lsoministeriet har erfarenhet j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med Galmudug. SPIDER f\u00f6resl\u00e5r vidare att skapa ett centralt nav f\u00f6r datalagring och hantering i Mogadishu.\n\nSammanfattningsvis syftar projektet till att utforma, uppr\u00e4tta och leverera ett HMIS som \u00e4r l\u00e4mpligt f\u00f6r Somalias infrastruktur och folkh\u00e4lsobehov. Utvecklingen av HMIS \u00e4r en viktig fr\u00e5ga f\u00f6r den federala regeringen och prioriteringen \u00e4r inkluderad i den nationella h\u00e4lsostrategin.",

De Globla riktlinjerna som \u00e4r obligatoriska att f\u00f6lja f\u00f6r samtliga fonder lanserades av OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef (ERC) i februari 2015. Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och st\u00e4rkts p\u00e5 ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen st\u00e4rker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppf\u00f6ljning p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5).  \n\nGivare har en r\u00e5dgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen \u201dAdvisory Board (AB)\u201d samt det globala r\u00e5dgivande forumet \u201dPooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, som b\u00e5da sk\u00f6ts av OCHA.

Sida har dessutom sedan 2013 etablerat rutiner f\u00f6r regulj\u00e4r uppf\u00f6ljning av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna samt st\u00e4rkt l\u00e4nken mellan projektuppf\u00f6ljningen i f\u00e4lt och konkreta dialogfr\u00e5gor som f\u00f6rs p\u00e5 global niv\u00e5. Under 2017 f\u00f6ljde Sida upp 16 av 18 landfonder (ej Centralafrikanska republiken och Jemen). \n\nSveriges roll i CBPFs/humanit\u00e4ra landfonder (tidigare kallade CHFer och ERFer)\nSverige har sedan uppr\u00e4ttandet av den f\u00f6rsta CBPFen (1997 i Angola) varit en p\u00e5drivande kraft i st\u00e4rkandet av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna. Det svenska finansiella och politiska st\u00f6det till fonderna har ytterligare st\u00e4rkts med \u00e5ren, d\u00e5 fr\u00e5gan om lokal f\u00f6rankring samt humanit\u00e4r samordning blivit centrala i \u201dStrategin f\u00f6r Sveriges humanit\u00e4ra bist\u00e5nd genom Styrelsen f\u00f6r internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (Sida) 2017-2020\u201d. \u00c5r 2015 f\u00f6rst\u00e4rktes denna position ytterligare genom en internationell h\u00f6gniv\u00e5 panel om humanit\u00e4r finansiering som tillsats av FNs Generalsekreterare och i vilken utrikesminister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m deltog. En av panelens huvudrekommendationer var att \u00f6ka st\u00f6det till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna i syfte att effektivisera det humanit\u00e4ra systemet.\n\nVal av CBPFer f\u00f6r Sida st\u00f6d har skett p\u00e5 basis av Sidas behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess. I vilken humanit\u00e4ra kriser i v\u00e4rlden analyseras utifr\u00e5n de humanit\u00e4ra principerna, i synnerhet opartiskhets principen. Sedan f\u00f6resl\u00e5s de mest relevanta partners f\u00f6r st\u00f6d i respektive kris. Den planerade insatsen att st\u00f6dja FNs humanit\u00e4ra landfonder \u00e4r avst\u00e4mt med UD inom ramen f\u00f6r HUMSAM och \u00e4r i linje med 2018 \u00e5rs humanit\u00e4ra allokering. Sverige \u00e4r idag globalt den tredje st\u00f6rsta givaren till CBPFerna. \n\nSida kommer att inom ramen f\u00f6r denna beredning ing\u00e5 avtal med tv\u00e5 parter, d\u00e5 fonderna formellt administreras av OCHA respektive Multi Partner Trust Fund Office/United Nations Development Programme (MPTFO/UNDP). \n\nAvtalet 2018 med OCHA g\u00e4ller elva humanit\u00e4ra landfonder som inbegrips i ett och samma avtal och som f\u00f6ljer samma format som tidigare \u00e5rs avtal med OCHA. \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Etiopien (35 MSEK), Irak (15 MSEK), Jemen (50 MSEK), Myanmar (10 MSEK), Pakistan (23 MSEK), Syrien (20 MSEK), Jordanien/Syrenkrisen (20 MSEK), Libanon/Syrienkrisen (15 MSEK),Turkiet/Syrienkrisen (25 MSEK) Palestina (15 MSEK) och Nigeria (20 MSEK). \n\nLandf\u00f6rdelningen f\u00f6r avtalet 2018 med MPTFO/UNDP \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: Afghanistan (60 MSEK), Central Afrikanska Republiken (12 MSEK), Demokratiska Republiken Kongo (80 MSEK), Syd Sudan (48 MSEK), Sudan (57 MSEK), samt Somalia (35 MSEK). \n\nSida f\u00f6resl\u00e5s besluta om ytterligare finansiering 2018 med 540 000 000 SEK (varav 24 MSEK beslutats om tidigare) i ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till nuvarande avtal med OCHA samt ett till\u00e4ggsavtal med MPTFO/UNDP till sammanlagt sjutton landfonder. Sida bed\u00f6mer att samtliga medel skall utbetalas i b\u00f6rjan p\u00e5 \u00e5ret f\u00f6r att p\u00e5 b\u00e4sta s\u00e4tt m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra planering och genomf\u00f6rande av humanit\u00e4ra insatser utan f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. \n\nGenom en enhetlig beredning som inbegriper alla sjutton fonder st\u00e4rks den humanit\u00e4ra enhets kapacitet att arbeta mer systematiskt med de sjutton fonderna. Fr\u00e4mst genom j\u00e4mf\u00f6rande landanalyser samt en sammanh\u00e5llen uppf\u00f6ljningsstruktur, i vilken ambassader och den humanit\u00e4ra enheten ing\u00e5r. En annan f\u00f6rdel med sammanslagningen av beredningen \u00e4r att ambassaderna kan frig\u00f6ra ytterligare resurser till fortl\u00f6pande uppf\u00f6ljning av fondernas effektivitet i f\u00e4lt, samt att Sida kan fokusera ytterligare p\u00e5 strategiska fr\u00e5gor inom ramen f\u00f6r de nationella r\u00e5dgivande styrgrupperna, \u201dAdvisory Boards\u201d. Det b\u00f6r \u00e4ven understrykas att arbetet med beredningen skett i n\u00e4ra samarbete med ber\u00f6rda ambassader. \n\nBed\u00f6mningspromemorian har skrivits p\u00e5 engelska med anledning av att engelskspr\u00e5kig personal i f\u00e4lt \u00e4r delaktig i beredning och uppf\u00f6ljning av insatsen, i enlighet med Generaldirekt\u00f6rens beslut om Sidas spr\u00e5kvalsmatris med till\u00e4mpningsanvisningar fr\u00e5n 1 mars 2013. En sammanslagning av tidigare sju snarlika beredningar \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 en del av Sidas f\u00f6renklingsagenda och frig\u00f6r tid f\u00f6r mer strategisk uppf\u00f6ljning och dialog.\n\nDetta \u00e4r ett kompletterande insatsbeslut i enlighet med 3.11.3 i Sidas insatshanteringsregel. Detta beslut bygger i stora delar vidare p\u00e5 den bed\u00f6mning som gjordes 2016 samt den uppdaterade bed\u00f6mning som beslutades om i februari 2017.

Detta regleras i de Globala riktlinjerna vilka \u00e4r obligatoriska f\u00f6r samtliga humanit\u00e4ra landfonder. De Globla riktlinjerna som \u00e4r obligatoriska att f\u00f6lja f\u00f6r samtliga fonder lanserades av OCHAs h\u00f6gsta chef (ERC) i februari 2015. Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och st\u00e4rkts p\u00e5 ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen st\u00e4rker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppf\u00f6ljning p\u00e5 projektniv\u00e5).  \n\nGivare har en r\u00e5dgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen \u201dAdvisory Board (AB)\u201d samt det globala r\u00e5dgivande forumet \u201dPooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, som b\u00e5da sk\u00f6ts av OCHA. Sida har en stark tradition att vara aktiv i b\u00e4gge sammanhangen genom ambassaderna och den humanit\u00e4ra enhetens fortl\u00f6pande arbete p\u00e5 nationell och global niv\u00e5. Sida har dessutom sedan 2013 etablerat rutiner f\u00f6r regulj\u00e4r uppf\u00f6ljning av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna samt st\u00e4rkt l\u00e4nken mellan projektuppf\u00f6ljningen i f\u00e4lt och konkreta dialogfr\u00e5gor som f\u00f6rs p\u00e5 global niv\u00e5. Under 2017 f\u00f6ljde Sida upp 16 av 18 landfonder (ej Centralafrikanska republiken och Jemen). \n\nSveriges roll i CBPFs/humanit\u00e4ra landfonder (tidigare kallade CHFer och ERFer)\nSverige har sedan uppr\u00e4ttandet av den f\u00f6rsta CBPFen (1997 i Angola) varit en p\u00e5drivande kraft i st\u00e4rkandet av de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna. Det svenska finansiella och politiska st\u00f6det till fonderna har ytterligare st\u00e4rkts med \u00e5ren, d\u00e5 fr\u00e5gan om lokal f\u00f6rankring samt humanit\u00e4r samordning blivit centrala i \u201dStrategin f\u00f6r Sveriges humanit\u00e4ra bist\u00e5nd genom Styrelsen f\u00f6r internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (Sida) 2017-2020\u201d. \u00c5r 2015 f\u00f6rst\u00e4rktes denna position ytterligare genom en internationell h\u00f6gniv\u00e5 panel om humanit\u00e4r finansiering som tillsats av FNs Generalsekreterare och i vilken utrikesminister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m deltog. En av panelens huvudrekommendationer var att \u00f6ka st\u00f6det till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna i syfte att effektivisera det humanit\u00e4ra systemet.\n\nVal av CBPFer f\u00f6r Sida st\u00f6d har skett p\u00e5 basis av Sidas behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess.

The rapid urbanization is caused by significant forced displacements from rural areas into urban areas driven by conflicts, insecurity, search for economic opportunities and cyclical environmental adversities such as drought and famine. This has a huge impact not only upon livelihood opportunities, peace and stability and resilience, but also shifting rural and pastoralist livelihood to urban economies. The urban influx raises many challenges for the provision of basic urban services including secure access to land for settlement of IDPs and existing vulnerable communities. Lack of effective land administration and planning systems and weak institutions has led to arbitrary distribution of land and has aggravated contestation over land, housing and basic services. Intense competition over land exacerbates forced evictions particularly among IDPs and urban poor.\n\nThe focus of this programme will be to promote inclusive employment opportunities for urban vulnerable populations, increase youth participation; integration of displacement affected households and to strengthen implementation of Durable Solutions and Youth development across Somalia. The programme will be implemented in Mogadishu, Kismayo, Baidoa and Dollow which are some of the majorly affected towns/cities.",

The rapid urbanization is caused by significant forced displacements from rural areas into urban areas driven by conflicts, insecurity, search for economic opportunities and cyclical environmental adversities such as drought and famine. This has a huge impact not only upon livelihood opportunities, peace and stability and resilience, but also shifting rural and pastoralist livelihood to urban economies. The urban influx raises many challenges for the provision of basic urban services including secure access to land for settlement of IDPs and existing vulnerable communities. Lack of effective land administration and planning systems and weak institutions has led to arbitrary distribution of land and has aggravated contestation over land, housing and basic services. Intense competition over land exacerbates forced evictions particularly among IDPs and urban poor.\n\nThe focus of this programme will be to promote inclusive employment opportunities for urban vulnerable populations, increase youth participation; integration of displacement affected households and to strengthen implementation of Durable Solutions and Youth development across Somalia. The programme will be implemented in Mogadishu, Kismayo, Baidoa and Dollow which are some of the majorly affected towns/cities.",

The programme is a follow-up phase of the \"IMS-Fojo Somalia Programme 2014-2018\" which amounted to a total figure of 57 MSEK.\n\nIn order to avoid an activity gap between the first and second phase, IMS/Fojo decided to start implementing the programme from 1st of January 2019 with temporary funding from IMS headquarter. This was done with the aspiration of Swedish funding for the second phase coming through during spring 2019. The Embassy will hence fund the activities retroactively, starting from 1st of January 2019. \n\nSweden is currently the only donor.",

        "description": "Somalia is one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with nearly 7 out of 10 people living in poverty. The poorest are widespread particularly among populations living in e.g. rural areas and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements. The humanitarian crisis in Somalia has for decades been one of the most complex and protracted emergencies in the world with climate-induced hazards (recurrent droughts and flashfloods), locust plagues and ongoing conflict. The country continues to be fragile with a population which frequently faces the predicament of too frequent shocks that do not allow ample time for recovery from local coping mechanisms.  \n\nClimatic changes which are likely to increase in both frequency and severity strongly impact on-going conflict dynamics, which in turn, significantly affect the livelihood of already vulnerable communities, especially through the effects on migration, forced displacement and loss of income generating resources/assets. The absence of livelihood options and the increase in poverty contribute to grievances, conflicts and susceptibility to shocks. The accumulation of household debt is a key vulnerability for those Somalis whose livelihoods are negatively impacted by repeated extreme patterns of climate shocks and intermittent conflict. Grievances that are linked to group affiliation are particularly serious risk factors as they affect conflicts on multiple severity levels.\n\nThe main objective of this contribution is to construct and contribute to the establishing a NEOC which will be the national hub for all emergency management planning and response, and the host the Federal Government (FG) level strategic response during a disaster situation in coordination and collaboration of the Federal Member States.",

        "description": "NRC is Norway\u2019s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida's Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC's capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida's humanitarian unit's annual budget appropriation which is substantial.\nThe objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: \"To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.\" It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.\nNRC\u2019s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.\u00a0Sida's Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC's method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).\nMore specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.\nAs an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:\u00a026% for Shelter and settlements,\u00a020% for\u00a0 Education,\u00a017% for Livelihoods and Food Security,\u00a014% for ICLA,\u00a09% for WASH,\u00a03% for Camp Management and\u00a011% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.\nThe good scores of NRC in ITAD's evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.\nDescribing NRC's activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC's work.\u00a0\nSHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC's expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in\u00a0protracted displacement situations.\nLIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life\u00a0and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten\u00a0livelihoods and individuals' and households' abilities to earn a living.\nICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one's rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC's lawyers.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to people to claim\u00a0and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative\u00a0dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity\u00a0documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge\u00a0around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face\u00a0particular obstacles in accessing their rights.\nEDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education\u00a0with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education\u00a0interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.\nCAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp\u00a0management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and\u00a0protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation\u00a0mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback\u00a0mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.\nWASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.\u00a0NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:\u00a0Provision of infrastructre for\u00a0water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.\nSida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida's funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.\u00a0\nRRM Allocation 2021\nIncluded in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC's capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida's funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.\nMethod- and capacity-building projects\nIncluded in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp; advocacy forums at the national level.\n- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it\u00a0focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the \u2018Safe Programming\u2019 framework defining minimum commitments for NRC's operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in 'refugee-like' situations.\n- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to\u00a0ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC's ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.\n- Sida's support to NRC's CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.\n-\u00a0NRC\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida's humanitarian unit and Sida's unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at\u00a0generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida's Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.\n- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.\u00a0NRC's active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida's support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC's commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.\n- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida's humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.",

Eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, progressively ensuring a world in which people at all times have sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life;\n2. Elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods;\n3. Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.\nBased on the global goals, FAO has formulated five strategic objectives:\n1. Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition\n2. Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable\n3. Reduce rural poverty\n4. Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems\n5. Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises\nThe Strategic Framework also includes a sixth, broad objective on technical quality, knowledge and services (including cross-cutting themes) that is designed to cover FAO\u2019s internal capability to deliver its strategic objectives. The objectives are in alignment with FAO\u2019s commitment to working in partnerships.\nIn humanitarian crises, FAO\u2019s main components are:\nTo help people to anticipate and prepare for crises; To respond fast to crises; To seek to reduce risks and address vulnerabilities.\nThe humanitarian operations are usually related to the 5th strategic objective which has the four following organizational outcomes (OO):\nOO1 - countries and regions have legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition;\nOO2 - countries and regions deliver regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food, and nutrition;\nOO3 - countries apply prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks for agriculture, food and nutrition;\nOO4 - countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition are prepared for, and manage effective responses.\nAt the next level in the FAO Strategic Framework, there are a number of outputs pertinent to humanitarian action, such as:\nOutput 4.1: Humanitarian action effectively protect lives and livelihoods of farmers, herders, Fishers, forest- and tree-dependent communities and marginal groups in times of crises.\nOutput 3.1: Strategies and related interventions improve the resilience of livelihoods systems at risk through prevention and mitigation efforts that minimize the potential impacts of disasters and crises on agriculture food and nutrition at national, subnational and community levels.\nOutput 2.2: Improved capacities of countries and communities to identify monitor and evaluate risks; conduct needs assessment and response analysis; and act on impending threats to agriculture, nutrition, food security and food safety (and related public health issues).\nOutput 3.3: Conflict-sensitive programmes on agriculture, food and nutrition reduce the risks of localized conflicts relating to access to grazing, forest and farming lands, fishing grounds, water, trees and other natural resources.\nAs Sida support FAO\u2019s operations through a variety of different projects in different contexts, this appraisal does not include an overarching results framework. In the annual follow up reading up to Sida\u2019s conclusion on performance all individual project reports will be analysed and assessed.",

        "description": "According to the project application the objective of the intervention is to promote high-level political dialogue processes as a means of contributing to improved peace and stability in Somalia. More specifically, to improve the political relationship between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and the Federal Member States (FMS); build the capacity of MoIFAR and FMS line Ministries in the implementation of the National Reconciliation Framework (NRF); and help resolve inter and intra-Federal Members States relations through dialogue. The Somalia National Reconciliation Framework/Plan will be used as a guiding document to holds all these elements together.\nThe project aims to continue building on and consolidating achievements made through Sweden\u2019s support to HD-facilitated work in Somalia to date. The project is based on three distinct but related dialogue streams or sub-objectives:\nPromote high-level dialogue between the FGS and FMS through the MoIFAR-led National Reconciliation Framework (NRF) implementation process that helps resolve political tensions between them and paves the way for consensus building on key issues including federalism, constitutional review, forthcoming election and security amongst other state building concerns. Facilitate capacity building and provision of technical advice by both local and international expertise to MoIFAR and FMS line ministries in the implementation of the NRF that informs and shapes the process while improving working relations between the FGS and FMS. Support dialogue processes for the FMS that helps them resolve inter and intra-state disputes that affects them helping in the building of more harmonious and mutually beneficial relationships.\nThese political dialogue processes in combination provide important building blocks for increased political stability in Somalia. The political developments in Somalia since the inception of the FGS have highlighted the importance of consultation and ownership by Somali leadership in order for the solutions to be sustained, achieve the necessary impact and stability on the ground. This project seeks to advance the objectives with the following activities:\nPromote high-level dialogue between the Federal Government of Somalia and the Federal Member States by: Continuing to work with senior representatives of MoIFAR at Federal and FMS levels as well as key advisors on reconciliation in the President/Prime Minister\u2019s office in reaching out to key high-level representatives to engage in the dialogue between the FGS and FMS; Working with MOIFAR using the NRF as an entry point in partnership with FBA and UN REFS to create an FGS-FMS inter-ministerial forum that will ultimately become the operational/implementation arm of the NRF process; Undertaking shuttle dialogue between key actors to develop strategies for getting buy-in and ownership of the top leadership at both the FGS and FMS level on the federal structure and other state building matters; Facilitating and convening dialogue between the FGS and FMS leadership in order to resolve conflict issues between them such as constitutional review, elections, federalism, security and agree on mechanisms to address any new arising matters; Providing technical advice and expertise in the dialogue processes as well as capacity building support for key stakeholders in thematic areas on economic, political and social issues such as resource and power-sharing, reconciliation and conflict resolution amongst others;\nExpected outcomes of objective 1:\nExpected outcomes of the 2021-2023 project: - Increased confidence amongst the parties\u2019, evidenced by their willingness and enthusiasm to participate in FGS-FMS dialogue;\n- Correspondence of action by FGS-FMS in relation to implementation of the Somalia National Reconciliation Framework and other national issues;   - Build consensus among the international community which supports this initiative on how best to support the FGS-FMS relationship building;\u00a0\n- Dialogue begins to improve the relationship between the FGS and FMS and helps to manage tensions on emerging issues;\u00a0\n- A forum is established that allows the FGS and FMS discuss and reach agreements on critical and long-standing critical issues that will determine the relationship between both the FGS and the FMS, going forward\nFacilitate capacity building and provision of technical advice by both local and international expertise to MoIFAR and FMS line ministries in the implementation of the National Reconciliation Framework by:\u00a0 Further consolidate the relationships established and effectively implement the resolutions reached in the course of the March 2020 HD-organized Study Tour to Rwanda to move forward the NRF implementation process;

Den humanit\u00e4ra samordnaren, som beslutar om insatser som finansieras genom fonden, kan d\u00e4rmed rikta finansiering till kritiska insatser inom HRP. \n\nDen humanit\u00e4ra samordnaren kan ocks\u00e5 n\u00e4r som helst rikta humanit\u00e4r finansiering till pl\u00f6tsligt uppkomna kriser eller snabbt f\u00f6rs\u00e4mrade kriser, genom den snabba finansieringsmekanismen \u201dEmergency Reserve Allocation\u201d.\nCBPFs har dessutom goda m\u00f6jligheter att n\u00e5 de akt\u00f6rer som har b\u00e4st f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar att genomf\u00f6ra effektiva insatser. De lokala akt\u00f6rerna har f\u00f6rutom den lokala expertisen som beh\u00f6vs ofta ocks\u00e5 tilltr\u00e4de till omr\u00e5den som inte \u00e4r tillg\u00e4ngliga f\u00f6r internationella akt\u00f6rer. Under 2020 f\u00f6rdelade CBPF 28 % av finansieringen direkt till lokala akt\u00f6rer och i vissa l\u00e4nder tilldelas lokala partners upp till 50 %. \n\nSida har bidragit till de humanit\u00e4ra landfonderna sedan den allra f\u00f6rsta fonden inr\u00e4ttades i Angola 1999. Sedan dess har Sida varit en av de st\u00f6rsta givarna till CBPF. Under 2020 fick CBPF\u2019s globalt 863 miljoner USD i finansiellt bidrag f\u00f6r att m\u00f6ta humanit\u00e4ra behov i 18 l\u00e4nder. \n\nCBPF\u2019s finansierar humanit\u00e4ra insatser som genomf\u00f6rs av FN, icke-statliga organisationer samt R\u00f6da korset / R\u00f6da halvm\u00e5nen. Under \u00e5ren har CBPF\u2019s \u00f6kat sin finansiering till lokala akt\u00f6rer. Idag uppg\u00e5r finansieringen till lokala akt\u00f6rer till 28% vilket \u00e4r en betydande \u00f6kning fr\u00e5n endast 11% \u00e5r 2014. \n\nCBPF\u2019s f\u00f6rvaltas lokalt av FN: s kontor f\u00f6r samordning av humanit\u00e4ra fr\u00e5gor (UN OCHA) under ledning av den humanit\u00e4ra samordnaren och i samr\u00e5d med det humanit\u00e4ra landteamet. Varje fond har en r\u00e5dgivande styrelse (Advisory Board, AB) som ger r\u00e5d om viktiga beslut och s\u00e4kerst\u00e4ller en effektiv f\u00f6rvaltning av fonderna. Den dagliga f\u00f6rvaltningen sk\u00f6ts av en chef f\u00f6r varje landfond samt operationell- och finansiell personal. P\u00e5 global niv\u00e5 finns arbetsgruppen \u201dPooled Funding Working Group (PFWG)\u201d, d\u00e4r nyckelintressenter s\u00e5 som givare, FN och NGOs finns representerade.

OPC \u00e4r f\u00f6rankrat i den internationella arbetarr\u00f6relsen i de specifika landkontexter d\u00e4r projekten genomf\u00f6rs via lokala partnerorganisationer. Organisationen bildades i sin nuvarande form 1992 som den svenska arbetarr\u00f6relsens samarbetsorganisation f\u00f6r internationell verksamhet och opinionsbildning. OPC \u00e4r en av Sidas strategiska partnerorganisationer (SPO) och har ett p\u00e5g\u00e5ende samarbete med Sida inom regeringens CSO-strategi 2016 - 2022. OPC har \u00e4ven ett flertal st\u00f6d fr\u00e5n andra samarbetsstrategier. Det \u00f6vergripande programm\u00e5let \u00e4r \"st\u00e4rka civila samh\u00e4llet och progressiv utveckling f\u00f6r demokrati, j\u00e4mlikhet och h\u00e5llbarhet.\" \n\nOPC arbetar integrerat med tre huvudomr\u00e5den inom det internationella utvecklingssamarbetet: \n- folkligt deltagande \n- fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete \n- partipolitisk organisering (st\u00f6ds ej inom CSO-strategin.) \n\nOPC samarbetar i sina projekt med 27 olika medlemsorganisationer (MO) tex ABF, LO och Unga \u00d6rnar. Ett projekt innefattar oftast \u00e4ven samarbete med en lokal organisation d.v.s. en partnerorganisation (PO).\n\nSidas bed\u00f6mning \u00e4r att OPC har en unik kompetens och l\u00e5ng praktisk erfarenhet av demokratiutveckling och fattigdomsbek\u00e4mpning i Sverige och internationellt. Med expertis i st\u00e4rkandet av r\u00e4ttigheter, organisering och fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete, utg\u00f6r OPC en v\u00e4rdefull partner i samarbetet med Sida. \n\nOPC har sju lokalkontor i Asien, S\u00f6dra Afrika och p\u00e5 V\u00e4stra Balkan. Kontoren best\u00e5r av 1-3 anst\u00e4llda. OPC arbetar n\u00e4ra sina partnerorganisationer och \u00e4r uppskattade i dessa partnerskap. OPC bygger sitt arbete kring internationell solidaritet och erbjuder sina samarbetspartner kontakter inom internationella n\u00e4tverk. OPC genomf\u00f6r kurser om bl.a. kvinnors r\u00e4ttigheter, organisationsfrihet samt st\u00e4rker marginaliserade grupper om hur de kan utkr\u00e4va sina r\u00e4ttigheter. De st\u00e4rker sina partnerorganisationers kapacitet s\u00e5 att dessa i sin tur effektivare ska kunna f\u00f6retr\u00e4da sina medlemmar. St\u00f6det ska leda till att partnerorganisationerna kan verka som demokratiska f\u00f6rebilder och p\u00e5verka or\u00e4ttvisa samh\u00e4llsstrukturer.\n\nOPC OCH SIDAS SAMARBETE\nUnder tidigare avtalsperioder och under den nu p\u00e5g\u00e5ende avtalsperioden har Sida konstaterat att OPC vidareutvecklats inom flera omr\u00e5den. Sida har bl.a. noterat att OPC st\u00e4rkt sina system f\u00f6r intern styrning och kontroll samt att programmen \u00e4r mer logiskt sammanh\u00e4ngande. Det \u00e4r framsteg som Sida ser mycket positivt p\u00e5. Samtidigt har Sida ocks\u00e5  bed\u00f6mt en del omr\u00e5den som mindre tillfredsst\u00e4llande, bl.a. bristande f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att f\u00f6lja upp avvikelse\u00e4renden och l\u00e5ngsam omst\u00e4llning fr\u00e5n projektst\u00f6d till k\u00e4rnst\u00f6d. Vad g\u00e4ller integreringen av de tematiska perspektiven s\u00e5 har tydliga framsteg gjorts men \u00e4n \u00e5terst\u00e5r mycket arbete, s\u00e4rskilt vad g\u00e4ller milj\u00f6 och klimat samt j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet.\n\nANS\u00d6KAN F\u00d6R 2020-2024\nDen h\u00e4r insatsen avses finansieras under \"CSO-strategin 2016-2022\" samt \"Myanmarstrategin 2018-2022.\" Ans\u00f6kan inkluderar flera program som ryms inom ett \u00f6vergripande program kopplat till CSO-strategin samt ett landprogram f\u00f6r Myanmar. Det \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5let f\u00f6r programmet \u00e4r att st\u00e4rka civila samh\u00e4llet och progressiv utveckling f\u00f6r demokrati, j\u00e4mlikhet och h\u00e5llbarhet. Ans\u00f6kan baserar sig p\u00e5 OPC:s internationella strategi 2020-2025. OPC:s f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringsteori utg\u00e5r fr\u00e5n fyra olika slags akt\u00f6rer: beslutsfattare, r\u00e4ttighetsb\u00e4rare, n\u00e4tverk/allianser och partnerorganisationer. Programmens fokus \u00e4r hur dessa akt\u00f6rer kan samverka f\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 progressiv utveckling.  \n\nVad OPC menar med \"progressiv utveckling\" kommer till uttryck i OPC:s fem politiska prioriteringar som \u00e4r f\u00f6ljande: \n1. Motverka hot mot demokrati och m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter\n2. St\u00e4rka j\u00e4mlikhet och arbetsvillkor - bygga nya allianser and arbeta f\u00f6r progressiv politik\n3. H\u00e5llbarhet utifr\u00e5n r\u00e4ttvis omst\u00e4llning - motverka klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar\n4. Fr\u00e4mja fred och dialog - minska v\u00e4pnad konflikt och social oro\n5. Mots\u00e4tta sig tillbakag\u00e5ngen - \u00f6kad j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet\n\nDessa fem prioriteringar \u00e4r utg\u00e5ngspunkten f\u00f6r programmen. OPC arbetar med beteende- och systemf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring inom de fem politiska prioriteringarna. Enligt OPC leder beteendef\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna till att samh\u00e4llen och system blir mer demokratiska, fredliga, m\u00e4nskliga r\u00e4ttigheter respekteras i h\u00f6gre grad och social och ekonomisk oj\u00e4mlikhet mellan m\u00e4nniskor minskar. F\u00f6r\u00e4ndringen gagnar de grupper som har minst resurser, s\u00e4mst m\u00f6jligheter, lever i st\u00f6rst os\u00e4kerhet och har minst makt, d.v.s. de allra fattigaste. \n\nOPC st\u00f6ttar sina partnerorganisationer i deras ambition att \u00e5stadkomma samh\u00e4llsf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring. Vissa av partnerorganisationerna arbetar direkt med de allra fattigaste t.ex. i Myanmar, Sydafrika och Palestina, medan andra arbetar mot m\u00e5lgrupper inom sektorer som inte tillh\u00f6r de allra fattigaste t.ex. arbetare . Gemensamt f\u00f6r dessa insatser \u00e4r arbetss\u00e4ttet; de samarbetar genom att erbjuda organisering. \u00c4ven de partnerorganisationer som inte arbetar direkt med de allra fattigaste arbetar f\u00f6r f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring som gynnar de allra fattigaste. De grupper OPC framf\u00f6rallt fokuserar p\u00e5 \u00e4r kvinnor, marginaliserade grupper samt arbetare. \n\nSidas bed\u00f6mning \u00e4r att OPC har en relevant och logisk bredd av aktiviteter, fr\u00e5n st\u00e4rkande av r\u00e4ttigheter, utkr\u00e4vande av r\u00e4ttigheter och organisering, till strategiskt p\u00e5verkansarbete f\u00f6r att f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra lagstiftning och andra samh\u00e4llsstrukturer. \n\nI ans\u00f6kan planerar OPC verksamhet i ca 20 l\u00e4nder, inom fem regionala program och ett tematiskt program samt tre program som fokuserar p\u00e5 metodutveckling och kvalitetss\u00e4kring. Verksamheten f\u00f6rdelas p\u00e5 ca 120 partnerorganisationer, varav ca 1/3 bedrivs helt eller delvis av medlemsorganisationerna. OPC har budgetansvar f\u00f6r de resterande st\u00f6den till partnerorganisationer. N\u00e5gra av partnerorganisationerna kommer fasas ut medan andra nya organisationer fasas in under den kommande avtalsperioden. Omfattningen av verksamheten, b\u00e5de i form av inneh\u00e5ll och storlek, \u00e4r i huvudsak en forts\u00e4ttning av p\u00e5g\u00e5ende verksamhet. De planerade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna presenteras under stycke \"F\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar fr\u00e5n p\u00e5g\u00e5ende program.\"\n\nM\u00e5len \u00e4r formulerade p\u00e5 en \u00f6vergripande niv\u00e5 eftersom de ska inkludera verksamheten i 20 l\u00e4nder med sina specifika kontexter. M\u00e5len \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 formulerade mer som \u00f6nskade riktningar och tillst\u00e5nd \u00e4n som specifika situationer vid programmets slut. Detta beror fr\u00e4mst p\u00e5 att m\u00e5len syftar till att \u00e4ndra beteenden och attityder. Alla programmen kommer inte att fokusera p\u00e5 samma politiska prioriterade fr\u00e5gor men tillsammans bidrar alla programmen till de fem politiska prioriteringarna. M\u00e5lformuleringarna och indikatorer f\u00f6r verksamheten har formulerats av partnerorganisationerna och medlemsorganisationerna tillsammans med OPC, i workshops i respektive region. \n\nMilj\u00f6 och klimat, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, konfliktk\u00e4nslighet samt anti-korruption \u00e4r perspektiv som kommer att integreras i alla program. Med bl.a. personalf\u00f6rst\u00e4rkning avser OPC att arbeta med kompetensh\u00f6jande insatser, och med metodutveckling f\u00f6r b\u00e4ttre verktyg och strategier inom perspektiven. \n\nEtt av OPC:s huvudsyften \u00e4r att st\u00f6tta medlemsorganisationernas utvecklingssamarbete. F\u00f6r att ta vara p\u00e5 medlemsorganisationernas intresse och engagemang erbjuder OPC medlemmarna olika m\u00f6jligheter att delta i samarbetet med partnerorganisationer. OPC har tre olika projektstrukturer: \n\n- Fullt ansvar f\u00f6r ett projekt; medlemsorganisation har ansvar f\u00f6r alla delar av ett projekt, fr\u00e5n planering till utv\u00e4rdering. OPC vidaref\u00f6rmedlar medel till medlemsorganisationen samt kvalitetss\u00e4krar projektet. \n- Deltagande i projekt; OPC hanterar budgetansvaret. I de h\u00e4r projekten kan medlemsorganisationernas specialkunskaper i folkligt deltagande, fackligt samh\u00e4llsarbete och partipolitisk organisering komma verksamheten till del \u00e4ven i de fall d\u00e5 den svenska organisationen saknar kapacitet att hantera budgetansvaret.\n- Fadder f\u00f6r ett projekt; medlemsorganisationen \u00e4r fadder f\u00f6r projektet och bidrar finansiellt till det. Den deltar i projektaktiviteter medan OPC ansvarar f\u00f6r projektets alla delar. \n\nSida anser att ett av OPC:s merv\u00e4rden \u00e4r att partnerorganisationerna kan dra nytta av medlemsorganisationernas erfarenheter, kunskap och n\u00e4tverk. \n\nBUDGET OCH ANS\u00d6KT BELOPP\nAns\u00f6kan, inklusive medel fr\u00e5n b\u00e5de CSO-strategin, Myanmarstrategin samt OPC:s egeninsats, har en total budget p\u00e5 613 208 006 SEK. Beloppet inkluderar \u00e4ven 2 000 000 SEK f\u00f6r verksamhet \u00e5r 2020 i Nordmakedonien. Under beredningen besl\u00f6ts det att insatsen i Nordmakedonien hanteras separat av den bilaterala strategin. Ans\u00f6kans reviderade total budget \u00e4r d\u00e4rf\u00f6r 611 208 006. Fr\u00e5n Sida s\u00f6ker OPC d\u00e4rmed ett bidrag p\u00e5 totalt 568 290 850 SEK f\u00f6r 2020-2024, varav det beloppet fr\u00e5n CSO-strategin \u00e4r 486 132 334 SEK. Egeninsatsen \u00e4r 10%. OPC ans\u00f6ker om en stor budget\u00f6kning, 21% av \u00e5rlig genomsnittlig budget under nuvarande avtalsperiod. F\u00f6r att visa p\u00e5 ett scenario med l\u00e4gre budget, inkom OPC i november med ett underlag d\u00e4r ans\u00f6kt belopp fr\u00e5n CSO-strategin var 471 157 666 SEK. Underlaget indikerar minskade ambitioner inom flera av de presenterade omst\u00e4llningarna i ans\u00f6kan. \n\nSida bed\u00f6mer det rimligt att OPC ans\u00f6ker om en h\u00f6gre budget i och med de f\u00f6reslagna f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna inom framf\u00f6rallt metodutveckling och intern kontroll. Sida bed\u00f6mer dock att den nuvarande verksamheten och de planerade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna kan hanteras med en mindre anslagsvolym, \u00e4n vad OPC ans\u00f6kt om. En del av de f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar som planeras har varit f\u00f6rem\u00e5l f\u00f6r m\u00e5ng\u00e5rig dialog mellan Sida och OPC och Sida bed\u00f6mer att OPC hittills inte har gjort de framsteg som f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntats. Sida anser att det \u00e4r av stor betydelse att OPC forts\u00e4tter att prioritera de presenterade omst\u00e4llningarna, \u00e4ven om den ans\u00f6kta budgeten inte beviljas i sin helhet.\n\nF\u00d6R\u00c4NDRINGAR FR\u00c5N P\u00c5G\u00c5ENDE PROGRAM\nDet f\u00f6reslagna programmet \u00e4r i stort en f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngning av det p\u00e5g\u00e5ende programmet avseende partnerorganisationer och verksamhetsl\u00e4nder. Flera av programmen \u00e4r omstrukturerade. OPC planerar f\u00f6ljande f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar inom programperioden: \n- \u00f6kade personalkostnader med 10%; f\u00f6r att vara b\u00e4ttre rustad att bedriva verksamhet i sv\u00e5ra kontexter, st\u00e4rka kapaciteten f\u00f6r internkontroll, metodst\u00f6d, och s\u00e4kerhetsfr\u00e5gor samt st\u00f6d till medlemsorganisationer i sitt samarbete med partnerorganisationer. Dessutom kr\u00e4vs \u00f6kade resurser f\u00f6r arbetet med milj\u00f6- och klimatomst\u00e4llning. Dessa f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar leder till att OPC st\u00e4rker sin f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att hantera sidamedel, b\u00e4ttre kan m\u00f6ta behov hos partner- och medlemsorganisationer samt st\u00e4rka sin f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att anpassa sig till nya globala f\u00f6ruts\u00e4ttningar.  \n- \u00f6kad lokal n\u00e4rvaro i samarbetsl\u00e4nderna; antalet anst\u00e4llda vid lokalkontoren \u00f6kar f\u00f6r ge ett mer kvalitativt, och kostnadseffektivt st\u00f6d till  partner- och medlemsorganisationer tex ska fler lokala kontor \u00e4n idag ha en controller. \n- \u00f6kat finansiellt st\u00f6d till partnerorganisationer. \n- f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrad resultathantering; fr\u00e5n traditionell redovisning med f\u00f6rutbest\u00e4mda resultat och indikatorer till adaptiv management, d\u00e4r indikatorer ska v\u00e4gleda uppf\u00f6ljningen av verksamheten. Metoden kr\u00e4ver mer personella resurser men v\u00e4ntas ocks\u00e5 inh\u00e4mta ov\u00e4ntade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar och resultat. \n- omst\u00e4llning av st\u00f6d till partnerorganisationer; fr\u00e5n finansiering av projekt inom partnerorganisationer till finansiering av hela organisationer, vilket leder till ett mer bist\u00e5ndseffektivt st\u00f6d. \n\nSida bed\u00f6mer att dessa f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar kommer att st\u00e4rka verksamheten och de f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntade resultaten, och v\u00e4lkomnar d\u00e4rf\u00f6r de presenterade f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna. \n\nANDRA SIDA-ST\u00d6D\nOPC f\u00e5r st\u00f6d f\u00f6r sin verksamhet fr\u00e5n olika avdelningar p\u00e5 Sida. Sedan flera \u00e5r tillbaka har Sida uppmuntrat OPC att s\u00f6ka medel fr\u00e5n andra finansi\u00e4rer. OPC:s beroende av sidafinansiering \u00e4r fortsatt mycket stor. F\u00f6r n\u00e4rvarande motsvarar det 84% av OPC:s totala inkomst f\u00f6r 2019.

Dessa var: j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, milj\u00f6 och klimat samt konflikt. Uppf\u00f6ljningarna genomf\u00f6rdes av sidar\u00e5dgivare och Sidas help desks. \n\nOPC:s ans\u00f6kan har beretts av en beredningsgrupp i en samberedning. F\u00f6ljande r\u00e5dgivare och/eller funktioner har ing\u00e5tt i gruppen: handl\u00e4ggare med ansvar f\u00f6r st\u00f6d till OPC, controller, resultatstyrning, j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet, handl\u00e4ggare med fokus p\u00e5 bist\u00e5ndseffektivitet och jurist. Beredningsgruppen har haft regelbundna avst\u00e4mningar i syfte att belysa OPC:s verksamhet och organisation utifr\u00e5n olika infallsvinklar och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra bed\u00f6mningen i sin helhet. Under beredningsprocessen har Sida haft flera m\u00f6ten med OPC, b\u00e5de i grupp och bilaterala mellan r\u00e5dgivare. Synpunkter har efterfr\u00e5gats fr\u00e5n relevanta svenska utlandsmyndigheter samt andra enheter p\u00e5 Sida som hanterar avtal med OPC.",

M\u00e5let \u00e4r att st\u00f6dja MUL att vara mer aktiva akt\u00f6rer inom det globala handelssystemet genom att hj\u00e4lpa dem att minska deras hinder inom handelssektorn. P\u00e5 detta s\u00e4tt arbetar EIF programmet mot ett \u00f6vergripande m\u00e5l f\u00f6r att fr\u00e4mja ekonomisk tillv\u00e4xt och h\u00e5llbar utveckling. I dagsl\u00e4get best\u00e5r EIF av 23 givare, 6 multilaterala organisationer (IMF, ITC, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World Bank), 2 observat\u00f6rer (UNIDO och UNWTO) och 51 l\u00e4nder (48 MUL och 3 l\u00e4nder som nyligen l\u00e4mnade MUL kategorin). \n\nSida har gett st\u00f6d till EIF sedan 2009. St\u00f6det har uppg\u00e5tt till 120 MSEK f\u00f6r implementering av EIF fas 1 som p\u00e5g\u00e5r fram tills 2017. Den f\u00f6reslagna insatsen inneb\u00e4r att st\u00f6dja EIF:s implementering av fas 2 med 100 MSEK under \u00e5ren 2017-2021. Hela tidsperioden av EIF fas 2 omfattar \u00e5ren 2016-2022 och insatsens totala indikativa budget ligger p\u00e5 274-320 MUSD.\n\nEIF:s syfte \u00e4r of\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat i fas 2 och syftar till att st\u00f6dja MUL att: (1) integrera handel i nationella utvecklingsstrategier, (2) uppr\u00e4tta de strukturer som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att samordna leveransen av handelsrelaterat tekniskt bist\u00e5nd, och (3) bygga upp handelskapacitet, vilket \u00e4ven omfattar att ta itu med kritiska begr\u00e4nsningar p\u00e5 utbudssidan. \n\nFokus inom EIF \u00e4r kapacitetsuppbyggnad inom handelsfr\u00e5gor av MUL och framtagande av behovsanalyser, s\u00e5 kallade Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS). D\u00e4refter tar man fram landspecifika \u00e5tg\u00e4rdsmatriser i syfte att kunna identifiera akt\u00f6rer och finansi\u00e4rer som kan genomf\u00f6ra insatserna. I vissa fall implementeras och finansieras prioriterade \u00e5tg\u00e4rder direkt inom ramen f\u00f6r EIF. Exempel p\u00e5 s\u00e5dana prioriterade \u00e5tg\u00e4rder fr\u00e5n fas 1 \u00e4r \"High Value Silk\" projektet som syftar till att \u00f6ka konkurrenskraften hos den kambodjanska silke sektorn f\u00f6r att skapa arbetstillf\u00e4llen s\u00e4rskilt f\u00f6r kvinnor, st\u00f6d f\u00f6r anslutning till WTO och kapacitetsuppbyggnad f\u00f6r handelsinstitutioner, regeringstj\u00e4nstem\u00e4n osv. Vidare syftar EIF programmet till att st\u00e4rka givarnas st\u00f6d till landets egen handelsagenda. MUL kan anv\u00e4nda EIF som en mekanism f\u00f6r att samordna givarst\u00f6det och tillf\u00f6r mer resurser inom deras handelsagenda, medan givarna kan ansluta sig till EIF som en mekanism f\u00f6r att leverera p\u00e5 deras \u00e5taganden inom handelsfr\u00e5gan. EIF:s aktiviteter finansieras genom en multi-donor trust fund.\n\nEIF:s globala f\u00f6rvaltningsstruktur best\u00e5r av EIF styrkommitt\u00e9n, EIF styrelsen, EIF sekretariatet och en fondf\u00f6rvaltare. EIF:s styrkommitt\u00e9 fungerar som ett \u00f6vergripande ledningsorgan, medan EIF:s styrelse \u00e4r det beslutande organet f\u00f6r EIF-programmet och ger strategisk tillsyn.

Zu diesem Zweck soll ein Insider-Netzwerk von engagierten Personen aus der Zivilgesellschaft gegr\u00fcndet und bef\u00e4higt werden, Mediation, Dialog und andere friedensrelevante Arbeiten vor Ort durchzuf\u00fchren. Zudem werden Workshops mit Akteuren der regionalen Verwaltung abgehalten, um ihr Bewusstsein f\u00fcr Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Frieden und Konflikten sowie Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf Konflikte zu sch\u00e4rfen und ihre F\u00e4higkeit zur Reaktion auf Konflikte auszubauen. Weiterhin werden in verschiedenen Distrikten Galmudugs gro\u00dfe Versammlungen im Rahmen des Gemeindedialogs organisiert, auf denen die Gemeindemitglieder lokale Konflikte und andere einschl\u00e4gige Fragen er\u00f6rtern und gemeinsam L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr diese Konflikte entwickeln k\u00f6nnen. Es wird 1-2 Mal im Monat ein regionales Radioprogramm produziert, in dem Friedens- und Konfliktthemen in verschiedenen Formaten diskutiert werden und an dem Zuh\u00f6rer aktiv teilnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Schlie\u00dflich werden die Anerkennung der Klimakrise und ihrer Auswirkungen auf Konflikt und Frieden sowie die Unterst\u00fctzung bei der Entwicklung von Ideen, wie die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels angegangen/reduziert werden k\u00f6nnen, in alle Projektaktivit\u00e4ten einbezogen.",

This is the reality for people living in tents and makeshift shelters without running water or soap in places like Syria, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nBut, as we have seen in the UK, simple measures can make a huge difference.

        "description": "FSNAU forecasts worsening food security and nutrition situation in the (2nd -3rd quarters) of 2019 in middle Shabelle region. Poor nutrition may deteriorate further with delayed rain and the impending drought. The FSNAU projects the GAM in Balcad district at 16% and SAM at 3.1%. The Nutrition Cluster estimates about 2,900 SAM cases annually in Balcad district with an estimated population of about 210,000 (including 21,000 IDPs). Zamzam in partnership with UNICEF has been providing integrated health and nutrition services in Bal'ad district since 2007 and this call for proposals (Reserve drought 2019) will serve to ensure the continuation of project activities to mitigate drought impact and cover the nutrition/health needs of children , women and men at target locations. The proposed project, which will be implemented from July 2019-July 2020 will provide a package of life-saving integrated interventions for vulnerable populations, including women and children, affected by drought conditions in targeted areas in Bal'ad district. Under this project, Zamzam will scale up its intervention through two integrated health/nutrition sites and 2 mobile outreach services targeting 35000 drought-affected people of 55% are women and girls. Zamzam proposes the following health/nutrition interventions: \n\n1. Deliver integrated Health, Nutrition services through two fixed health facilities and 2 mobile teams : The services to be provided include vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children 6-59 months, immunization for children less than one year and referrals. (at least 4300 children under-5 are given two VAS ,and deworming tablets and immunized(disaggregated by sex). In addition, an estimated 2800 Pregnant women in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters are dewormed. \n2.

Screen children for malnutrition and malnourished children (6-59) referred by CNW to appropriate programme (TSFP/OTP, SC) for treatment. The two fixed nutrition/health sites and 2 mobile teams will provide at least 5 out of 9 BNSP components. This will allow us to treat 7000 children with MAM and 2,900 children (6-59 months) with SAM, including 290 with medical complication are treated by August 2020. UNICEF/WFP will provide all the supplies needed for treatment in-kind. \n4. Promote, enable and sustain behaviour change related to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF-E). Zamzam will implement mother-led MUAC approach and train community health workers on IYCF promotion to allow them to support 5 Pregnant and lactating women receive individual/group counselling for IYCF and increased service uptake at community level.\n5. Capacity building: The capacity of staff will be improved IMCI , IMAM ,Early warning/early response, IYCF -E while the community members will have participate community health education and awareness session on AWD prevention and response. \n6. Improve reporting, monitoring and maintain Integrated Disease Surveillance and action. at least the health/nutrition sites report monthly DHIS/ONA to the government , health and nutrition cluster",

We will target pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children below 5 years (CU5) in the host community, IDPs and returnees  in Adale where we are the secondary rationalized partner. In Adale we will operate 1 static outpatient therapeutic feeding center (fixed OTP) and 2 mobile outpatients therapeutic feeding programme teams (mobile OTPs) targeting 8 locations chosen on the basis of vulnerability and absence of nutrition interventions in the district. The static facility will be established in Cadale town area while the 2 outreach teams will serve 8 locations namely Ceel Xarar, Ceel Yaag, Boos Hareri, Buro Sheikh, Garas Dhagey, Janab, Gudgudud and Gacal Nur. We will engage UNICEF/WFP for backstopping during training of the project staff, community health workers (CHWs) and mothers for the \u201cmothers MUAC approach\u201d, on nutrition screening and case identification, Integrated management of acute malnutrition(IMAM),Infant and young child feeding education (IYCF-E) and Nutrition, health and hygiene promotion (NHHP).The trained staff will be deployed to the targeted locations, mobile/static OTPs where together with the trained mothers will screen CU5 and PLWs. CU5 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) conditions will be enrolled in the static/mobile OTPs for nutrition and medical rehabilitation. CU5 and PLW with MAM conditions will be referred to TSFP centers. We will open 2 fixed TSFP/BSFP centers, one in Adale town and the other in Haji Cali to be integrated with a fixed nutrition centers operated by WOCCA. Hygiene promoters will be trained on Nutrition, Health and Hygiene Promotion (NHHP), they will disseminate hygiene promotion messages to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera. Mothers will be counseled by trained nutrition staff and CHWs on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. We will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MMNs) and Vitamin A supplements to PLW and CU5 through the static/mobile facilities. A referral system will be put in place to transfer patients from one component to the next (when the patient condition worsens), or to return to the previous one if the evolution of treatment is satisfactory. In order to boost access to essential healthcare services, we will borrow from the successes of our ended IERT project We will upgrade, equip and properly staff the fixed nutrition centers to provide basic health services to malnutrition affected population by providing access to treatment of common childhood diseases and Health care support to PLW (including ANC and PNC), and EPI. Efforts to improve vaccination in drought-affected and marginalized populations will be integrated into fixed and mobile service delivery mechanisms.  doctors and nurses will be hired for the nutrition centers. emphasis will also be given to social mobilization campaigns to educate communities on common health issues and support implementation of community hygiene Promotion for epidemic outbreak Prevention.

The target group will be selected from those impacted by drought with limited humanitarian support due to access difficulties and blockade. \n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable such as the marginalized, unaccompanied children, older persons, persons with disability, single women, pregnant and lactating mothers, single headed-households, persons with chronic illness or psychological condition, large families and/or families with babies, toddlers or children attending school, persons at risk as identified by protection officers and those living in the open or in makeshift buuls without adequate access to shelter. The project team will undertake a vulnerability assessment involving documenting of household profiles in the target area to identify the most vulnerable who are in urgent need for shelter assistance. Data will be collected through a number of methods including structured interviews with households heads, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and direct site observation. Collected data to inform beneficiary selection will also be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area as needed to avoid overlap. Mindful of the Somali context and utilizing its expertise in target locations, AVORD will pay attention to issues of diversity in the targeting process. \n\nFollowing need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries, AVORD will provide affected households with standard NFI kits comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, I Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Torch and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. The proposed content in each set is based on current Shelter Cluster standards for people in humanitarian emergencies. Since there are no functioning NFI markets in No.50, AVORD will use an in-kind modality for provision of NFIs. Besides, emergency shelters will be constructed for newly displaced households living in the open or under deplorable shelter conditions. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with relevant line ministries of the South West Administration and No.50 District Authorities to secure land tenure for a minimum of 5 years before the construction of emergency shelters.\n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.\n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek Integration with other clusters and own interventions in the region to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

The action is in line with the SHF reserve allocation 2019 hence targeting one of the most undeserved communities in hard to reach areas as prioritized by the call for proposals. Specifically, the project will enable INTERSOS to fill the WASH gaps through provision of sustainable WASH assistance package including innovative solutions that can contribute to durable solutions. \n\nThe overall objective of this response is to provide Sustainable life-saving WASH services to the most vulnerable in Diinsoor district to improve access to safe and sustained water and hygiene educations, reduce acute watery diarrhea AWD/cholera incidences and WASH related diseases through Drilling and equipping of one strategic borehole with solar-diesel hybrid pumping system that will help in lowering the cost of system operation and more importantly lower emission of carbon footprint. Hydrogeological survey will be conducted in Dinsoor town to identify the suitability of ground water. Complete water distribution networks with elevated tanks and water consumption points (water kiosks) will be installed and constructed as per the available designs and BOQs. All water construction works will be constructed through service contracts with reputable water infrastructure companies who will be supervised by INTERSOS Engineer based in Diinsor. INTERSOS will employ local specialised manpower in order to rehabilitate and develop 11 existing shallow-wells through construction and raising of concrete aprons, de-silting to increase the yield of the wells, India mark 2 water pumps will be installed to ease fetching, watering trough will be built to separate the human consumption from livestock water consumption. \n\nMoreover, INTERSOS will introduce manual drilling of wells that are located in the water bed of the water streams or seasonal with pvc pumps. 11 wells will be drilled using this innovative technic. 3 local technicians will be trained and will be given materials and tools to support the population and start a sustainable and profitable business. The safety of water will be guaranteed through water treatment at the water sources while training of water management committees will embed sustainability through improved operations and management and cost recovery measures, water quality monitoring at the source and household level and where necessary will provide remedial measures through awareness raising on safe water handling by regularly conducting sanitary surveys to suspected water sources to identify risk factors, treatment options like chlorination will be done during rehabilitation and development of these wells and boreholes. \n\nIn addition, the project will address the sanitation and hygienic behavior among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion and provision of hygiene kits to 1000 households, distribution of water purification tablets to acute watery diarrhea AWD/cholera suspected homes, institutional hygiene promotion. Hygiene promotion will be built on people\u2019s own knowledge of risk and disease prevention to promote positive health-seeking behaviour. \n\nINTERSOS is currently the only INGO present in Diinsor and the only humanitarian actor implementing wash programs in the District as described in the paragraph coordination and complementarities, majority of the sanitation activities will be conducted in the same targeted location through a project funded by the Italian Cooperation moreover, this project will contribute to a nutrition outcome since INTERSOS will enhance complementarities in the same area with an ongoing nutrition project funded by SHF (a scale up of the same project being discussed with UNICEF).\n\nA total of 21800 (5,308 women, 5,376 men, 5,200 girls and 5,916 boys) are expected to benefit from this project action.",

        "description": "FSNAU post deyr 2018 assessment indicated critical levels of acute malnutrition among rural and pastoral populations with critical GAM gt15 and Serious SAM rates reported in Bakool region. The ongoing Gu rains 2019 (April to June) started late and have performed poorly and are likely to further aggravate the vulnerability of drought affected population including IDPs, poor host communities in Elbarde in Bakool region. These IDPs and poor host communities experience limited access to basic services including access to WASH services. The contributing factors include drought, dry jilaal season (January \u2013March 2019), displacement coupled poor WASH infrastructure. The prolonged drought in Bakool region led to limited access to sustained safe drinking water and increased risks related to  acute water diarrhea and malnutrition among population in Elbarde district in Bakool region. \nAccording to HIDIG WASH assessment conducted between 27- 28 May  2019 indicated that majority of affected population (80%) in ELBARDE district can't afford the cost of water due to increased price of water (55% increase) exposing thousands of families to walk more than 45 minutes for water collection which expose women and adolescent girls risks for gender-based violence. The assessment report indicated that, between 70-80% of shallow wells (26/38 wells in the assessed locations) are on open source condition and hence expose to contamination of water and to increases incidences of AWD cases. In addition, HIDIG/UNICEF health facility report in May 2019 indicated that AWD and skin diseases were among top five disease reported. To respond this alarming situation, the proposed project will improve access to WASH services for a total of 23000 drought/AWD affected communities (including 5750 women , 6900 girls, 6900 boys and 3450 men) IDPs and host communities in Elbarde district in Bakool region. The organization proposes sustained solution to improve access to WASH services services of the affected people in line with Somali WASH cluster response plan:\nWater: 1. Provision of sustained access to safe drinking water to through construction/rehabilitation of one boreholes equipped with hybrid and supplied water to two kiosks through piping system to two kiosks. Extension and construction of water supply systems in IDP camps benefiting 12000 drought affected men, women, girls and boys in Elbarde district. \n2. Construction/ rehabilitation of 12 shallow wells with hand pumps benefiting at least 11000 drought /AWD affected communities in Elbarda district \n3.  To ensure the sustainability and the management of water facilities, HIDIG will ensure to enhance the capacity of WASH committees to keep the maintenance and operation of the water source after the project is faced out.  HIDIG will ensure the maintenance and the appropriate use of water facilities in close coordination and coordination with IDPs mainly camp committees (men and women). \nSanitation :Construct 100 flood proof gender sensitive desludging latrines with hand washing facilities and with inside and outside lockable door to ensure the privacy of women and girls. around men, women and children are equally\n Hygiene promotion activities : HP will carry out comprehensive hygiene and sanitation promotion awareness campaign to promote the adaption of good hygiene and sanitation practices to affected men, women and children. \nSustainability : The rehabilitated  water sources (boreholes) will also serve as the main water supply sources to support neighboring villages with water trucking in the recent dry seasons.ill .The propose WASH investments will help affected communities in accessing sustainable water sources and eventually  reduce the impact of recurrent droughts ,climate shocks and improve their resilience in long run",

According to the FSNAU- FEWS NET- Post Deyr Technical release IN Feb 2019, more than 1.5 million people will face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) through June 2019 and an additional 3.4 million people are classified as Stressed (IPC 2), which brings the total number of people in Somalia facing acute food insecurity through mid-2019 to 4.9 million. In addition, 903,100 children under the age of five years will likely face acute malnutrition in 2019, including 138,200 who are likely to be severely malnourished. \n\nTension and occasional clashes between Somaliland and Puntland over the contested Sool and Sanaag regions has led to displacement of more than 1000 households to nearby locations. According to reports from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency, the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume anytime. Baidoa district is one of the main hubs for IDPs and presents critical gaps in terms of humanitarian coordination and information as well as service provision. Drought conditions combined with a proliferated conflict with Al Shabab has exacerbated displacement. An estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance, including Baidoa and Sanaag IDPs. Conditions for IDPs are likely to deteriorate unless humanitarian support is scaled-up. \n\nIn the presented context, through CCCM, ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement these activities in 42 IDP sites in both Sanaag and Baidoa 39 previously supported IDP sites in Baidoa (ref: SOM-18/3485/SA1/CCCM-WASH-Shelter/INGO/8671) to build on the gains achieved through the SHF integrated support by focusing on capacity building, self-management and handover of activities to communities 3 new IDP sites (Karasharka, Fadhigaab, El-Midgaan) in El-Afweyne district of Sanaag, targeting a largely undeserved area. 6,443 HHs (approximately 38,658 people) in Baidoa and 1,222HHs (approximately 7,332 people) in Sanaag, a total of 7,665HHs will benefit from this intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas.",

People displaced to informal sites do not have their basic needs met due to the inconsistent provision of services or exclusion from accessing humanitarian support as a result of poor targeting of sites. This project seeks SHF allocation towards the strengthening camp coordination and camp management in order to ensure equitable access to services and protection for displaced persons in Banadir region. Majority of IDPs in Banadir region settle in informal and unplanned settlements where the conditions are very poor and forced eviction is a common threat, and where newly displaced people join those whose displacement has become protracted. Many are displaced multiple times. CCCM will strengthen the predictability and effectiveness of multi sectorial interventions at site level through continuous mapping of displacement settings, improved community participation and continuous monitoring.\n\nNoFYL is aware of challenges existing around land and property tenure arrangements, including customary access rights to land when selecting sites for the construction of the community centers. Where the land or property is privately held, NoFYL will consult with relevant stakeholders to obtain authorization and a long term formal agreement from owners to ensure long term sustainability of project constructions. \n\nThrough this project, NoFYL will reach 4,203 HHs in 7 IDP settlements with a total target beneficiary of 19,218 in Deynille and Kaxda districts with necessary services through coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stake holders and other partners.

During the course of project duration, AVORD will also distribute a range of tools for effective disaster and solid waste management. Critical site infrastructure including 240 latrines and 40 main gates will be upgraded to minimize protection risks and enhance safety at sites. In the selection of beneficiaries for cash-for-work activities, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

        "description": "The education system has suffered widespread loss and damage, resulting in limited capacity and resources.\nAccess to education has reached a historic low, with more than three million children today out of schools in Somalia. The national Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) is 30 per cent for primary education and 26 per cent for secondary level education (HRP 2019 report). \nThe project intends to target 16 IDP sites in Baidoa town. The identified camps are among the 391 IDP camps which were in great majority set up during 2017 and which are home to 47,873 HHs (CCCM report, DSA, March 2019). \nThis project aims to achieve access to education for IDP children by targeting 2,185 out of school children (1,090 boys and 1,095 girls) living inside IDP settlements in Baidoa to ensure their access to school thus enhancing their safety and protection as well as the enjoyment of their rights. Out of the total 2,185 children, 2,060 are primary school age children while 125 are secondary school age children and/or children above 15 years.\nThis project will ensure that emergency and crisis affected children/youth have access to safe and protective learning environments in the partner schools. This will be done through a comprehensive action to respond to immediate and longer term needs of the children. The learners will be provided with access to food, water and scholastic material and children with protection concerns will be supported through strengthening/creating referral mechanisms where necessary, to specialized services. Girl  education will be at the center of the project encompassing all activities and it will be promoted with trainings, advocacy campaigns and community mobilization in support of changing negative attitudes and practices. Adolescent school aged girls will also be provided with sanitary pads in support to improving their attendance rates in classrooms and CECs will be sensitized on the importance of girls\u2019 education during the back to school campaigns. Personal hygiene and sanitation, school personnel and parents\u2019 commitment to provide leadership in promoting girls\u2019 education are proven to be two key factors in improving girls\u2019 attendance rates as recommended by the beneficiaries during FGDs held by INTERSOS staff in the current SHF EiE project implemented din Wajid and Education Cannot Wait project implemented last year in Baidoa. \nThe foreseen construction and rehabilitation of temporary learning spaces will ensure access to a safe and enabling learning environment. Additionally, capacity building will be conducted for CECs and teachers on pedagogy, child protection, child wellbeing and psychosocial support. Teachers will also be supported through payment of monthly incentives corresponding to 100 USD for a period of 8 months. \nAmong the 16 targeted settlements, the 3 IDP camps located within the Horseed urban village called Shimo Tiyeglow, Kalimey and Bohaladi will be provided with two new learning spaces and segregated gender latrines since no education service is present in this area. \nChild protection is mainstreamed into the project. One of the key focus of the project will be indeed to prevent and respond to children with protection concern considering the school as a safe space and an entry point to enhance children\u2019s protective environment. The project will conduct regular analysis of the situation of children regarding causes and patterns of protection concerns and will respond accordingly through prevention and strengthening or creating quick referral pathways, conduct service mapping to facilitate appropriate referrals and strengthen coordination and linkages in service delivery to ensure quality comprehensive services to the children with protection concerns.\n Building communities\u2019 resilience and promoting the reintegration of children in the formal education system. In 2018 INTERSOS already successfully referred and supported 117 children to the public schools Mustafa Sheik and Sahal Moalim.",

Child protection focal points will be recruited at schools while all schools will have active child to child clubs. The purpose of these activities are to promote the safety and protection of students at schools, make school safe and child-friendly zone and identify and support children with protection and psychosocial support. This will also cultivate a culture that respects child rights and promotes their protection. \n\nThe ultimate aim of the project is to ensure greater access in safe learning environment and improved learning for children affected by emergencies to reduce violence, avoid further marginalization and loss of another generation. \n\nIn order to improve the quality of education, teachers will be trained on child-centered teaching methods and psycho-social support, and given emergency incentives.  Community Education Committees (CECs), local authorities and partners will be trained on psycho-social support skills, emergency preparedness, contingency planning and related issues. The proposed intervention will also improve the education authorities\u2019 and CECs capacity to plan for and respond to education in emergency situations.\n\nThe project will target and support a total of 6750 students, 120 teachers and 140 CEC members.Beneficiaries will be selected through participatory and predetermined selection criteria prioritizing the most affected and needy people and 48% will be girls. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age and diversity dis-segregated data. \n\nThe project will be directly implemented by NRC in collaboration with Puntland State ministry of Educations and Education clusters.

Abuses such as physical assault, recruitment of children into militias, abduction, high drop-out cases have been reported by a number of agencies all of which gravely affect learning processes. \n\nThe project is designed to reach IDP children of school going ages to: \n1) Provide immediate child protection for the most vulnerable children through awareness creation and support to the child to child clubs \n2) Increase resilience through the provision of basic education and support to school-based resilience mechanisms that will contribute to the sustainability of education programs\n3) Build the capacities of teachers and CECs to better respond to child protection issues and better manage school resources.\n\nThe project targets 8 primary schools in Bay region affected by the protracted crisis in South West State. READO in response to emergency-affected learners in the larger Somalia has proposed this project to mainly retain 3051 learners (1434 girls) and 48 teachers (24 female) and 28 CECs (14 female) at school in mitigating the case of high school dropout rate following effects of prolonged drought crisis. The project will focus on the provision of quality learning opportunities through\n Provision of quality Teaching and Learning Materials in 8 public primary schools\n Water provision in 8 schools and complimentary food provision in 8 public primary schools targeted aimed at improving the quality of learning by contributing to physical and mental growth of learners.\n Providing teacher incentives to 48 teachers and head teachers spread over the 8 targeted schools aimed at improving the quality of life.\nProviding protective learning environments for most vulnerable learners through\n Training of 48 teachers and 28 CECs on child protection issues including PSS, DRR spread over the 8 targeted schools.\n Rehabilitation of 8 classrooms in the 4 Primary schools targeted.\n Rehabilitation 8 separate gender appropriate latrines,12 hand washing facilities, 3 water tanks for three schools.\nAnd build the capacities of teachers and CECs to better manage school resources with a focus on finding sustainable solutions through\n Training of 48 teachers and 28 CECs on management of school resources\n Establish child to child clubs at school, referrals of cases, tracing and unification.\nREADO will manage to address Education concerns brought about by the drought in the schools that READO has been supporting with the help of volunteer teachers. This will also act as entry points to address other emergency related concerns like AWD outbreaks in schools, school health screening and aid provision challenges. \nBy implementing this work in such a manner, READO is ensuring to not only build up the resilience, capacity and education opportunities available to vulnerable groups in Baidoa, but to improve the capacity, coordination and cooperation between the different groups and administrations within the city.",

Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, safe water delivery to schools, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines and water storage tanks. Specific Protection activities will include case management for separated and unaccompanied children and GBV survivors, mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, linking schools to referral pathway outside the school and facilitating the development of school-level child protection action plans. Relief International (RI), through child protection committees, will deliver messages to schools and communities on key protection concerns affecting the community. These messages will target prevention as well as the response in the event protection concerns arise. RI will also continue to engage with relevant government ministries such as the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MoEampHE) and the Office of Puntland Human Rights Defenders. RI will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in the targeted schools, RI will truck safe water to all 31 schools but CECs will manage its distribution. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacities and improve school preparedness against future disasters. Child- and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. RI will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. RI, in collaboration with the appropriate ministries, will map existing referral pathways and service providers and link schools to these services. Where pathways are weak or non-functional, RI will strengthen them to ensure effective response to child protection concerns. To monitor the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, RI will facilitate joint review workshops with schools, service providers, and relevant government ministries. Through engagement with ministry officials such as MoEampHE Gender Focal Points, Office of Puntland Human Rights Defender and CECs, RI will leverage the respective agency apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established referral mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools and the larger communities.",

        "description": "The detrimental effects of underperforming rains are impacting the parts of population that is still trying to recover from the effects of an extended drought in northern and central Somalia. The deteriorating food security outlook, combined with the worsening malnutrition calls for a rapid and well-targeted scale up of response to save lives and support recovery. The project is aimed at improving the ability of vulnerable HHs to meet their basic needs, supports protection and recovery of livelihood assets through life-saving UCT, animal treatment services and emergency fodder provision in Burco district Togdheer region. The project targets 1137 vulnerable drought affected pastoralist HHs including women, men, boys, girls, and female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The drought has severely and directly affected pastoral communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk. This has led to household food insecurity, sharp increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and animal use. Additionally, the drought affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debt and therefore not able to purchase veterinary drugs, fodder and water, which is essential when livestock body condition is so poor thus susceptible to opportunistic diseases.\n\nCOOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation, the beneficiary women, girls and the disabled will be included in decision making processes, monitoring so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, unconditional cash transfer will be provided to 1137 drought affected pastoralists HHs including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services. \n\nTo protect key livelihoods assets of pastoralists, livestock belonging to 400 vulnerable pastoralists HHs (including female headed) affected by drought who cannot afford costs for livestock drugs and treatment services will be provided with treatment. This activity will prevent deaths and reduction in production through treatment of livestock against bacterial infections. Moreover, emergency fodder provision for core breeding herd belonging to 200 HHs during stress periods will prevent losses and ensure milk availability for children. The activity is aimed at protecting livestock assets of the drought affected pastoral communities from starvation, opportunistic infections and death. This activity is envisaged to reduce workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, GBV  and exploitation associated with searching of livestock feed and transporting fodder for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed livestock feed provision\nIn summary the following activities will be carried out:\n1. Provide unconditional cash to 1137 HH. 2.) Provide livestock treatment support for 400 HH. 3.) Emergency fodder provision for core breeding herd belonging to 200 HHs during stress periods to prevent losses and ensure milk availability for children.",

        "description": "Though the food security and livelihoods situation improved due to good performance of 2018 Gu rain in most part of Somalia, the poor performance of Deyr 2018 rainfall coupled with Sagar Cyclone along the coastal region deteriorated the food and livelihoods situation in poor households. \nThe project targets the Coastal areas in Awdal region which are predicted to receive below normal and near normal rainfall which will realize water availability and pasture regeneration that will not sustain them through the long dry spell period, necessitating continued humanitarian and livelihoods support to bridge the gaps in these periods.\nIn response to the deteriorating food security condition and humanitarian need, VSF Germany is seeking to up-scale the current OCHA \u2013SHF funded intervention in Awdal region by targeting additional beneficiaries in districts which are currently not covered by the ongoing project and also extend to one additional district .The up scaling Action will thus cover  Zeylac district( a new district),thus covering 3 districts in Awdal Region, Somaliland . \nThe designed Action is a humanitarian response to improve immediate food access, restore and prevent further deterioration of food security and livelihoods of vulnerable households in target project locations. This overall goal of the response is to contribute towards improving food access and availability, animal health, livestock productivity and livelihoods restoration. This in turn will enable beneficiary households to get access to milk, income, food and enhance nutritional status of their families including children. VSF Germany will closely work with other humanitarian actors in the areas to avoid duplication of efforts through regular coordination and monitoring of similar activities at field level and build synergies. This up-scaling Action is expected to benefit a total of 650 households (3,900 individuals) in the target district (Zeylac). Specific intervention include: Provision of unconditional cash transfer (for immediate food access) Animal health services (treatment and vaccination campaign) (to protect and restore livelihoods).Animal health services will be delivered in partnership with Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development (MoLFD). Thus, implementation of these key interventions in the target areas would yield multiple benefits 1) prevent vulnerable households from employing negative coping strategies and, 2) restore the livelihoods and due to healthy and nourished animals hence improved milk availability and 3) prevent loss of key household assets and thus build resilience of target community . The target households will also be linked with local veterinary drug shops and Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW) in order to get required animal health services. The Action is aligned with the standard allocation strategies and food security cluster objective 1 to improve the immediate access to food objective 2, to protect and restore livelihoods related to food and income sources and objective 3, to support resilience of vulnerable populations against shocks.",

        "description": "The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2019 and the 1st 2018 SHF Standard Allocation for the Food Security and Livelihood as it applies to project planned target District of Hobyo (South Mudug Region). The project will provide lifesaving support to 7,704 people assessed to be in acute food insecurity, \u2018Crisis\u2019 and \u2018Emergency\u2019 phases of IPC (3 and 4)  by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and safety net support.\n\nThe project proposes lifesaving interventions that are gender sensitive, adapt centrality of protection and that mainstream gender and protection in the delivery methods proposed. The project will specifically prioritize destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the two Districts) and other households as identified in the Hobyo Districts that fall into the IPC 3 and 4. The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the failure of the Deyr 2018 season rains in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project seeks to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food to 733 vulnerable households through Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) for 3 months with each household being entitled US $71 as per MEB for Mudug Region. The project will undertake a vulnerability assessment in selected locations of the targeted 4 locations in the District (2 settlements with IDPs and 2 settlements with high number of vulnerable host households) with the findings being used in developing the criteria for selection of the planned UCT beneficiaries and informing on protection needs.  Priority for the UCTs beneficiaries will be given to women-led households from the most vulnerable among recently displaced, non-displaced and socially marginalized communities in each of the respective target District. The UCTs planning will also be supported by a market analysis undertaken in the District (undertaken by the FSL Team) to determine the capacity of local markets to absorb the resources extended to the beneficiaries. \n\nIn addition the project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 451 unskilled laborers rehabilitating 3 Water Pans.  Each unskilled labourer of the planned 410 CfW laborers shall get $ 5 per day for 30 days and 41 skilled laborers at the rate of US 7. A total of 6,000 CUM water impounding capacity will be added to the current existing 1,080 CUM in the 3 targeted dams in Hobyo District. The project will also support the protection of the core breeding and milking herds normally under the care of women in the rural and urban settlements through supportive treatments. This will involve the creation of the requisite animal treatment capacity (currently missing) involving the provision of fixed value animal treatment vouchers.  A total of 1,000 animals in the district are targeted where each HH is estimated to be keeping 10 Shoats. A total of 100 HHs will be targeted in the District. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure that the project gets feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and arising gaps that will require humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below average rainfall for the coming Gu 2019 season as indicated by FEWSNET in its January 2019 update.\n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular helps make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project to ensure it provides the women safety and protection required.",

It\u2019s not the first time the town has experienced flooding.\n\nSave the Children is proposing an 8-month integrated Health, Nutrition and WASH project targeting flood affected populations in Beletweyne, reaching a total of 71,876 individuals (men: 15,032, women: 31,553, boys: 12,139 and girls: 13,152). Displaced (9,019 men, 18,932 women, 7,283 boys, 7,891 girls non displaced, (6,013 men, 12,621 women, 4,856 boys, 5,261 girls).\n \nThe proposed project is in line with cluster strategic objectives by providing integrated lifesaving health, nutrition and WASH services. The nutrition cluster priority districts in Hiran region including Beletweyne due to critical levels of GAM rate at 19.6 and SAM of 4.1. The project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected populations. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project includes construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health, nutrition and WASH services through the support of static health facilities and mobile outreach to the flood affected populations in Hiran, particularly Beletweyne District. There will be 8 sites that will provide integrated health and nutrition services for flood affected communities, offering outpatient consultations, routine immunization, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTPs, TSFP, IYCF-E and referral to stabilization centers. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will also be provided. Special focus will be given to prevention of disease outbreak and malnutrition, improve early identification malnutrition by empowering mothers to use MUAC screening, access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThe WASH component in health and nutrition will also improve good hygiene practices, rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure, more equitable and better access to sustainable water points for drinking and handwashing with soap, and provision of basic sanitation services in these facilities. Hygiene and sanitation support and promotion will be provided in an integrated approach in the health and nutrition sites. There will also be outreach nutrition, hygiene and health promotion within the community and in schools. This will empower children to be agents of change for hygiene promotion.",

        "description": "Flood triggered displacement is on the rise in Middle Shebelle, with new areas engulfed by floods water during the wet season every day. The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

        "description": "The proposed six-month project aims to provide urgent lifesaving assistance to flood-affected communities in Beletweyne while mainstreaming protection and integrating sustainable, flood-resistant solutions. The WASH intervention will improve the health and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in flood-affected communities through increased access to safe water, use of latrines, hygiene promotion and increased adoption of safe hygiene practices. Cash programming, in the form of conditional transfers, vouchers, and cash for work (CfW), will form a core pillar of the proposed intervention. Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

Already at least 6.3 million people, nearly half of the country\u2019s population are affected by the situation. More than 548,000 people in Somalia have been forced to flee their homes due to flooding in the Hiran region (Belet Weyne, Buuloburto and Jalalaqsi) including children (OCHA report Nov.). Belet Weyne town and the surrounding areas of Hiran region of Somalia is the worst affected where more than 140,000 people are already flee from their homes with empty handed and displaced highland locations, while some households displaced to their relatives living non flood affected areas, putting burden to already vulnerable communities with limited resources (food and water). Authorities and the local community members are trying to mitigate the impact of the floods in residential areas. However, flood risks are still high considering the flow of water to downstream areas of River Shabelle as water levels in Belet Weyne are receding. In this proposal, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in Jalalaqsi district. Under this allocation, AADSOM will improve better access to clean water, use of latrines and increased health promotion and safe hygiene practices to 20,000 women, men, boys and girls including people with disabilities and marginalized communities affected by the current floods. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project include:\n- Provision of safe water to 1000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Upgrade/Rehabilitation of one strategic borehole equipped with hybrid system and rehabilitation of flood damaged 20 shallow wells with hand pumps. \n- Capacity building of 11 WASH committees and 42 Well Operators to ensure continuity of service, operation and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross cutting\n- Construction flood destructed 214 gender separated and flood proof latrines and 6 gender sensitive flood proof institutional latrines in Nasrudin Primary School with lockable doors to avoid GBV against women and girls and washing basin benefiting around 245 students.\n- Conducting comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 20,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers and feeding centers \n-Training 15 community hygiene promoters, who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out and \n-Distribution of 1000 HP kits to 1000 households (UNICEF will supply) with vulnerable populations served by the established water services. \nThe proposed response took into consideration the impact of women, and children in terms of access to WASH services.

Since inception, the Somalia NGO Consortium has grown as an effective network, actively supporting its members to promote dialogue, collaboration, learning experiences, information exchange and to advocate on issues of key concern. Currently, the Consortium is the primary NGO coordination and representation mechanism, with a membership of 93 national and international NGOs working in all parts of Somalia/Somaliland, around humanitarian, development, peace-building, health, education among other thematic areas.  Governed by a Steering Committee elected by the membership, the SNC provides a platform for information-sharing and representation to governments, UN agencies, donor groups and multilateral organisations at local, national and international levels. The Consortium has offices and representation in Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Garowe, Baidoa, Kismayo and plans to expand its reach to constituencies in the remaining federal states through extensive outreach work from the current offices. The SNC expects to reach 100 NGOs by end of 2019 which will increase membership needs. The SNC is currently co-funded through Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), OFDA (USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and membership subscription fees. Legal and contractual responsibilities associated with funding and contracting are held by host agencies, as SNC is not a legally constituted entity, but rather a network of its membership. During the relocation process in 2019, the SNC has gone through transitions on multiple levels including management and relocation form Nairobi to Mogadishu.

        "description": "TThe NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO.\n\nIn response to and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed by 4 INGOs and 1 LNGOs), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support.\n\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor Assistants, NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 41,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions, injuries and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs. \n\nThe project budget leans heavily on HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "The overall goal of the project is to contribute to improvement of living conditions and access to basic services for displaced in persons by bolstering effectiveness of coordination mechanisms and community led governance structures in Luuq which is a CCCM under-served area. The envisaged actions will set the foundation for attaining durable solutions through strengthened community self-management. DRC will facilitate the analysis of needs and intervention gaps within IDP sites in Luuq, initiating advocacy for support to respond to identified needs and gaps, as well as protection concerns. DRC will also contribute to the administrating and documenting regular cluster meetings in collaboration with UNHCR. DRC will engage local authorities including governmental and community leadership to work towards durable solutions for displaced populations. \n\nThe project will engage implementing partners and relevant authorities on identified needs, gaps, and overlaps. Furthermore, DRC will advocate for and support the adoption of an area-based approach for service delivery in IDP sites. The project will conduct training of relevant government authorities in CCCM principles to enhance their understanding of humanitarian assistance through the CCCM model.\n\nDRC will take on responsibility for targeted IDP sites to undertake the following:\n- Map out existing governance structures and focal points at the targeted IDP sites. Where governance structures exist, their capacity will be built in camp management and other essential principles. Where these governance structures are absent, DRC will facilitate their establishment through the creation of Camp Management Committees (CMCs).\n- Monitor service delivery in the IDP sites through CCCM Mobile Teams to identify any service gaps and overlaps of interventions by implementing agencies.\n- Reinforce accountability to displaced populations through increasing communication and feedback on availability of services. This will be done through multiple approaches including construction and establishment of community centers for information hubs, and through awareness raising campaigns about site services. Furthermore, DRC will establish and strengthen complaint and feedback mechanisms (CFMs) in sites. For referrals, DRC will work with existing protection stakeholders on appropriate and principled referrals, with particular attention to protection concerns, and service delivery to persons with special needs.\n- Work to improve site safety and hygiene through a participatory approach, utilizing a cash-for-work modality to carry out site maintenance activities. This additionally links participating IDP residents to temporary income and encourages ownership of the site. Site safety audits and fire hazard training will also be conducted.\n\nBeneficiary description:\nThe proposed intervention supports multiple stakeholders through camp management activities at the targeted five IDP sites with the aim of increased coordination at the site level, for displaced populations in  Luuq, where the established governance structures will hold monthly coordination meetings at the site level to discuss gaps and needs of IDP residents so that these identified gaps and needs will be taken  to the relevant humanitarian partners who assist in filling those gaps at the targeted sites.\nAt the present time, based on discussions with relevant stakeholders, DRC has selected the following sites to support:\n1.Ban Munduli (Akaro) - 715 H\u2019H\n2.Buyle - 520 H\u2019H\n3.Luuq Hilaac - 355 H\u2019H\n4.Jazeera - Jadiid - 450 H\u2019H\n5.Luuq Waaberi - 460 H\u2019H",

The project intervention is timely significant to address and respond to the education cluster and drought response plan (June-December 2019) strategies: i) prioritize education support to children where they live and ii) education opportunity to children in place where they move to ensure they can continue their education. Education is critical during emergencies like drought. It protects children from risks and protection related concerns. School-aged children will be provided lifesaving education intervention to schools they are currently learning to prevent the risk of dropout as well as mitigate the protection risks. Equally, school-aged children who are displaced by the drought will be reached out to their places to ensure they have access to quality education and protection services in locations they moved to the proposed project will be targeting 4000 school aged children affected by the drought in 18 schools in Belethawa (4 schools), Bardhere (4 schools), Luuq (5 schools), Garbaharey (2 schools) and Burdhubo(3). The project will target 4000 school-aged drought affected children in Gedo (2,200 boys and 1,800 girls). Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies: As per the education minimum standard on teaching and learning materials, learners and teachers will be provided learning materials in accordance to set standards. Each grade 1-3 student will receive learning kit consisting of 7 books (6 single ruled and 1 single Squared100 sheets), 4 pencils, 4 rubbers and 2 sharpeners while students between Grade 4 and 8 will receive  7 books ((6 single ruled and 1 single Squared 100 sheets), 2 pens,2 rubbers , 1 sharpener and one student mathematics set. Bags will be given the girls provided for the sanitary kits to carry their sanitary materials to the schools to reduce their absence during menstrual period, emergency school feeding to promote retention of learners, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers, training of teachers and CECs on education and child protection, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. WASH Specific activities will include water trucking to the schools and construction of water storages (Barkets), the construction of gender segregated school latrines with hand-washing facilities.  As education is lifesaving, protection mainstreaming will be key and critical to ensure children have access to protective learning environment. HIRDA will conduct protection service mapping in the target schools. The members will be able to identify children with protection concern both at the school and community. They also, help in organising children led social mobilization campaign in the community. Also, organise structured recreational activities in the school4000 (1800 girls) learners will be provided with recreational materials as per the education cluster minimum standard. Children in the target locations will have access to structured recreational play in the schools. Through the recreational materials, children will have access to play and interact with other children. Children clubs will also be established in the target schools.\n\nHIRDA has been active education partner as well as nutrition and health. Based on its vast experienced field staff who benefited trainings offered by the education cluster and UNICEF, HIRDA will be directly implementing this project. The project will complement the ongoing alternative basic education, health and nutrition programmes funded by UNICEF. School-aged children will have access to nutrition screening exercise to identify children with acute malnutrition and treated.

        "description": "The proposed project seeks to improve  immediate access to food and to protect and restore the livelihood-related food and income sources for the most vulnerable rural H.H living in rural  Baidoa villages in Bay region - Somalia. The project targets 1,350 households comprising of 8,247 boys, girls, women and Men. Project period will be 6 months. The primary target will be the most vulnerable families under the integrated food security classification (IPC) 3 and above that are currently living in  rural Baidoa villages. Target will be mainly villages of northern Baidoa namely Lawiiley (9km), Midow (12km) and Maaranka (15km) and small villages around these three. The assistance will be emergence-oriented agricultural support to 1350 rain fed farmers living in the target villages to secure harvest in the coming Deyr rainy season. The project will provide each family a package of farming seeds (sorghum (30kg) and cowpea (10kg)) and farming tools. The beneficiary farmers will be trained on the best agricultural practice/ good agricultural practice (GAP) to enhance and develop their capacities on farming. \nComplementary unconditional cash transfer (UCT) will be transferred to the target beneficiaries in a period of 3 months to improve immediate food access during the lean season. The monthly rate of the cash transfer is $30/family. This complies with March 2019 minimum expenditure basket (MEB) value recommended by CMWG in May 2019. It is anticipated that the cash transfer support will improve their food consumption, nutritional status of the children and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms that exposes women, children and other vulnerable groups to the risk of displacement. \nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and drought affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance.",

        "title": "Providing Emergency Unconditional Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Households in Diinsoor",
        "description": "The underperforming Deyr rains in 2018 and Gu rains in 2019 have heavily impacted the lives and livelihoods of households in Diinsoor which has led to an increase in the number of households in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and IPC Phase 4 (emergency). Rural populations in the hard-to-reach and undeserved areas around Diinsoor have been severely affected as result of poor agricultural production and limited access to services due to limited coverage by aid agencies. Household debt levels in this area remain high with many households utilizing negative coping mechanisms as a means to survive this lean period. Findings from a rapid needs assessment conducted by ACTED in Diinsoor on 16 and 23 June found that 62% of households do not regularly meet their food needs. Due to this dire situation, ACTED proposes an emergency short-term response to address the acute food insecurity and alleviate the humanitarian needs. The project will provide life-saving support to 1,614 vulnerable and drought affected households (9,684 individuals) through unconditional cash transfers in Diinsoor. ACTED plans to distribute four-months of consecutive unconditional cash transfers to these households from August until November 2019. Overall, these activities align with the Food Security cluster objective to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phase vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods. Moreover, the project aligns with the Somalia HRP 2019 objective to provide life-saving and life sustaining integrated assistance to reduce acute humanitarian needs and excess mortality among the most vulnerable people. Unconditional cash transfers act as a measure to prevent further deterioration of the food security of households and act as a buffer against the continued impact of the failed rains. These unconditional transfers in Diinsoor provide a quick response to increasing needs and enable households to access the functioning markets in Diinsoor.",

        "description": "March 2019 - Decades of political instability have left Somalia facing a complex and protracted humanitarian crises with an estimated 4.2 million Somalis (35 percent of the population) expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2019. Some 2.6 million people have been forced from their homes, with little or no access to the basic services. Acute malnutrition rates remain near or above emergency thresholds, particularly among displaced populations. Violence due to terrorist threats and multiple conflicts has made access a challenge in many regions, hampering the ability of humanitarian workers to reach those in need.  With the support of GAC and other donors to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is providing funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond to newly emerging crises and shifting/deteriorating humanitarian situations. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities, such as shelter, healthcare and protection, by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening the coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations.",

In doing so, it facilitates the implementation and monitoring of humanitarian interventions in numerous life-saving thematic areas. In most countries requiring humanitarian assistance, challenging security situations, long distances and poor road conditions impede surface travel. Also, adequate commercial air operators do not serve most of the destinations the humanitarian community needs to reach.  As such, aid workers rely on UNHAS to provide access in situations where reaching isolated communities is not otherwise feasible. This project operates in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen. With GAC\u2019s support, UNHAS is helping to facilitate access to isolated communities.

Internal displacement remains at record levels, with an estimated 2.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) living in more than 2,400 sites across the country, and severe food insecurity is projected to increase in 2021, as a La Ni\u00f1a weather event is expected to bring renewed drought conditions early in the year. Altogether, an estimated 5.9 million people in Somalia will require humanitarian assistance in 2021.  With GAC\u2019s support, CARE is improving access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene services and helping households meet essential needs amongst internally displaced persons, returnees, and host communities in Somalia\u2019s drought- and conflict-affected Lower Juba region. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating water points and distributing water and sanitation related non-food items in IDP communities; and (2) providing unconditional cash grants to vulnerable IDP, returnee, and host community households.",

        "description": "Somalia has one of the highest maternal- and child mortality rates in the world. Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

        "description": "This project aims at restoring stable communities in Somalia through establishing local structures that research, identify, analyse, prioritize and implement solutions to community security issues, in collaboration with local authorities, formal security actors and civil society. At the state level, it will re-establish bodies that promote community-responsive policing, acting as a link through which information on security provision is channelled, and form bridges between local, state and national levels. Learning and insights from all levels will be fed upwards through national-level civil society networks, promoting community-focused security provision at national and international level. The objectives of the programme are to strengthen the capacity of local civil society groups and communities to research and facilitate broad dialogue across clan and state-society divides about local security issues, provide resources for implementation of joint conflict prevention and community security initiatives, support cross-regional community exchange to share experiences and common security problems, link community members with existing dispute resolution mechanisms, support the re-introduction and development of regional oversight mechanisms such as police accountability committees with channels for community input, provide training on accountability, gender- and conflict-sensitivity, link these bodies into a cross-regional learning network, facilitate their engagement in policy dialogue at the federal member state level, conduct policy discourse with the Somali federal government, regional bodies and international actors to communicate evidence about inclusive approaches to improving human security, and facilitate dialogue among policy-makers at the national level and communities. This will eventually result in a reduction in inter and intra-clan division and violence, more inclusive, responsive and accountable security provision including effective mechanisms to prevent misuse of power and improve coordination, greater coherence in policy formation between Federal regions, and more evidence-based policy and programming on human security from international actors.",

        "description": "UN Joint Programme for Local Governance and Decentralised Service Delivery, (UN JPLG) Phase III is a pooled basket funded programme implemented by UNDP (contracting agency), ILO, UNICEF, UNCDF, and Habitat in all the regions of Somalia and Somaliland. Phase III of the programme started on 1st July 2018 and is envisaged to end on 30th June 2023. Federal governance structures in Somalia, all highlight a need for focusing on the third level of government (the district) as part of the federal consolidation and new state formation, without which genuine stability, encompassing most citizens, will not be realized. The Government of Somalia has identified the unique role local governments have in strengthening social contracts and contributing to service delivery and their role in building the legitimacy of the state and improving the resilience of communities to shocks, conflict and disasters. Establishing and capacitating local governments to promote good governance is included as national priorities in National Development Plan (and associated State Development Plans) as well as the Stabilization Strategy under the Comprehensive Approach to Security (CAS) and the Wadajir Framework for Local Governance. UN JPLG III is best placed to support the Government of Somalia to achieve local governance goals because of the implementation history of JPLG I and II and the long-term partnerships formed with local authorities. JPLG III will support the state to achieve context specific goals for local governance as well as contribute to strengthening the capacity of government to lead coordination at Federal, state/central and district levels. This would be achieved through  support to policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance; strengthening the capacity of local governments to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace and improve the engagement between citizen and local government, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups.",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

Le projet qui s\u2019inscrit dans le cadre du Programme d\u2019action national pour l\u2019adaptation au changement climatique (NAPA) de la Somalie met l\u2019accent sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer des plans r\u00e9gionaux de gestion des ressources en eau. Il constitue un pas important dans les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le Somaliland pour mettre en valeur et g\u00e9rer durablement ses ressources en eau. Le projet s\u2019articulera autour de quatre composantes principales : i) la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un plan de GIRE ; ii) l'\u00e9laboration d\u2019un plan d\u2019investissement contenant des projets et des programmes, aux fins de financement ; iii) la conception et ex\u00e9cution de travaux de r\u00e9habilitation prioritaires ; et iv) la fourniture d\u2019appui au secteur et renforcement des capacit\u00e9s. La pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un plan de gestion des ressources en eau et d\u2019investissement permettra au projet non seulement d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la gestion des ressources hydriques, mais aussi de mobiliser les grands investissements requis pour d\u00e9velopper le secteur. \u00c0 long terme, le projet devrait avoir un impact consid\u00e9rable sur les efforts fournis par le pays pour se remettre des effets de la s\u00e9cheresse, contribuer \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019alimentation en eau et la r\u00e9silience face \u00e0 la s\u00e9cheresse, am\u00e9liorer les moyens de subsistance et appuyer la reprise \u00e9conomique. Sa mise en \u0153uvre se d\u00e9roulera sur une p\u00e9riode de 30 mois \u00e0 partir de la date d\u2019approbation. Le co\u00fbt estimatif total du projet, y compris les droits, taxes et imp\u00f4ts, s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 3 000 000 euros.",

        "description": "This Program Document proposes a Reengagement and Reform Development Policy Financing (DPF) for the Federal Republic of Somalia in the amount of US dollar 420 million from International Development Association (IDA) grant resources. The objectives of the proposed DPF are to facilitate full normalization of relations with the World Bank Group (WBG) and support Somalia's economic recovery through policy reforms that strengthen fiscal management and promote inclusive private sector-led growth. Up to SDR 271.2 (up to US dollar 375 million equivalent) of the proposed grant will be disbursed to the bridge-loan creditor assisting with arrears clearance (\u2018Portion A of the Financing\u2019); and SDR 32.6 million (US dollar 45 million equivalent) will be disbursed to the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) as budget support to meet cash flow needs after Somalia has cleared its arrears to IDA (\u2018Portion B of the Financing\u2019). The DPF complements a rapidly expanding engagement to build human capital and strengthen resilience to climate change and other shocks. In FY2020, the World Bank is currently delivering technical assistance to develop livestock insurance, a major Urbanization Review, and upstream analysis on health and education that are expected to inform new financing. The DPF also addresses the above challenges by enabling full reengagement with the WBG. The DPF will facilitate Somalia's clearance of arrears to IDA, which is a requirement to qualify for international debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Full reengagement with the international community through the HIPC process is expected to enable Somalia to access the financial and technical support the country needs for sustained poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. Normalization of Somalia's relationship with IDA would give the government's access to financing from IDA's Crisi",
