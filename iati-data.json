        "description": "This Joint FGS-UN Programme aims to capitalise on recent security, governance and reconciliation achievements by expanding employment opportunities for young men and women, mainly in newly recovered areas. The programme recognizes the centrality of youth in fostering stability in the country and outlines specific interventions that can be taken within the next 24 months to begin to generate decent work opportunities for young people that will serve as positive alternatives to participation in violence and conflict. This will also contribute to the revitalization of the local economy. The programme will tackle youth at risk, unemployed and underemployed youth. The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months. The programme will initially be tailored for the first 24 months as per the Compact deadline (see also Table 1): \u2022 1: Improved long-term potential for growth, productivity and employment of at least three value chains in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector. \u2022 2: Equip 10,000 youth with basic literacy, numeracy and life-skills and sector-specific vocational and business training to enhance their employability to access sustainable job opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential. \u2022 3: Create 30,000 short-term jobs created through cash-for-work projects to rehabilitate productive infrastructure in target locations, mainly in newly recovered areas.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict. The funds received under DFID are to support activities under Outcome 2, in addition these activities are under \u2018Outcome 3: Sustainable local government investment vehicles are identified, designed and operated\u2019, in the Local Investment for Transformation in Somalia (LIFT-Somali) agreement with UNCDF.",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

The objectives of the proposed DPF are to facilitate full normalization of relations with the World Bank Group (WBG) and support Somalia's economic recovery through policy reforms that strengthen fiscal management and promote inclusive private sector-led growth. Up to SDR 271.2 (up to US dollar 375 million equivalent) of the proposed grant will be disbursed to the bridge-loan creditor assisting with arrears clearance (\u2018Portion A of the Financing\u2019); and SDR 32.6 million (US dollar 45 million equivalent) will be disbursed to the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) as budget support to meet cash flow needs after Somalia has cleared its arrears to IDA (\u2018Portion B of the Financing\u2019). The DPF complements a rapidly expanding engagement to build human capital and strengthen resilience to climate change and other shocks. In FY2020, the World Bank is currently delivering technical assistance to develop livestock insurance, a major Urbanization Review, and upstream analysis on health and education that are expected to inform new financing. The DPF also addresses the above challenges by enabling full reengagement with the WBG. The DPF will facilitate Somalia's clearance of arrears to IDA, which is a requirement to qualify for international debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Full reengagement with the international community through the HIPC process is expected to enable Somalia to access the financial and technical support the country needs for sustained poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth.

The project takes place in two phases: First completing the manual clearance of Somaliland at which point mine action in Somaliland will become completely owned funded and implemented by national authorities with su\nfficient capacity to tackle any residual tasking. Finland has supported this project since 2003. Second HALO will seek and destroy community held or abandoned stockpiles of ammunition held outside of state control across their area of operations in Souther\nn Somalia. The primary beneficiaries of the project are local populations in areas where HALO will conduct mine clearance and stockpile destruction.

        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Northern Somalia in 2018 remains fragile due to residual impact of drought, Cyclone Sagar, conflict and ongoing displacement. While the risk of famine has reduced, humanitarian needs remain high, with extreme water and pasture shortages reported in rainfall deficit areas of Bari, Nugaal, Sool and Sanaag regions. Water scarcity in Sool and Sanaag regions has reached a precarious level, affecting the health of the most vulnerable people and causing occasional resource-based clan conflicts. With only a third of the population having access to improved sanitation, poor hygiene practices (including frequent open defecation) are prevalent, contributing to incidences of water-borne diseases. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve WASH service delivery at district level. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness. \n\nACTED will implement these activities in Taleex district of Sool region, and Erigavo and Dararweyne districts of Sanaag region, targeting a highly vulnerable and largely undeserved area. Approximately 15,000 people (2,500 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, or escalation of conflict, which may cause communities to flee to other areas.",

Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Local health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

HALO?s project seeks to 1) contribute to the human security and reduce civilian accidents and casualties by \nlimiting the impact and proliferation of explosive items 2) contribute to the peace dividend and assist fragile communities in their own efforts to reinstate a working and stable society and 3) reduce poverty and hunger by removing blockage to high priorit\ny infrastructure water access and roads. The project takes place in two phases: First completing the manual clearance of Somaliland at which point mine action in Somaliland will become completely owned funded and implemented by national authorities with su\nfficient capacity to tackle any residual tasking. Finland has supported this project since 2003. Second HALO will seek and destroy community held or abandoned stockpiles of ammunition held outside of state control across their area of operations in Souther\nn Somalia. The primary beneficiaries of the project are local populations in areas where HALO will conduct mine clearance and stockpile destruction. Finland will support HALO?s project in Somalia during 2017-2020 with one million euros.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

        "description": "IOM MIDA Finnsom IV project focuses on contributing to improved health outcomes in Somaliland and particularly its remote regions. The additional funding supports the Somaliland Ministry of Health efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic health consequences\n for 3 months. To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three outputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Loc\nal health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increased capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Som\nali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developing strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child hea\nlth. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health outcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has b\neen evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide quality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the plann\ning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer than in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora expe\nrts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also implements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 un\ntil August 2020. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

The structure of the DRA enables participating NGOs to respond to major international crises in a timely and effective manner. The rising number of humanitarian disasters around the world has placed an increased burden on international aid organisations. The global increase in the number of armed conflicts \u2013 and the deepening complexity of these conflicts \u2013 is also adding to the severe strain on the existing humanitarian system. The Dutch Relief Alliance (DRA) was established to meet these challenges. Improved cooperation and coordination between NGOs enables them to better respond to major international crises in a timely and effective manner. The DRA members collaborate in humanitarian interventions \u2013 delivering greater impact than members operating independently. The DRA members are: CARE Nederland; Cordaid; Dorcas; ICCO en Kerk in Actie; Oxfam Novib; Plan International Nederland; Red een Kind; Save the Children; SOS Kinderdorpen; Stichting Vluchteling; Tearfund NL; Terre des Hommes; War Child; World Vision; and ZOA.

        "description": "The key objective is to implement preventative measures for vulnerable groups that have limited access to COVID-19 prevention and response actions. This is to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in urban IDP settings. The intervention will focus on the most vulnerable groups: older people \u2013 forming approximately 2.7 per cent of the population and the urban poor and IDPs about 75% of the population. Assessments shows these as most vulnerable who are heavily impacted by COVID-19 infection. For this response, IRS seeks to complement the efforts of the government and other humanitarian organisation in Somalia by reaching approximately 40,000 beneficiaries directly and up to 200,000 indirectly.\n1. Risk communication and community engagement. The proposed project will support preventative measures to combat the spread of COVID 19. This will include extensive awareness initiatives using multiple media channels to support preventative action of the government and communities. The information/ education and communication is designed to reach the population  through print, audio-visual media messages, SMS and community mobilisation using religious/community/group leaders and elders. Display monitors on COVID 19 risks and prevention in local language will be installed at strategic locations such as roundabouts, airports and community centres in IDP camps.\n2.  Health: Strengthen existing health facilities in the selected IDP camps to combat COVID 19 infection. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to seven health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will also set up and equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections.\n3. WASH: Reduce the spread of COVID 19 and decrease morbidity and mortality in the selected districts. The project improve hygiene practices, limiting infection IDP camps.24 hand-washing stations will be built in the IDP camps in Bondhere, Baidoa, Balcad, Gardho and Burtinle. Hygiene kits, containing bath soap, laundry soap, 2 jerry cans, and facemask, will be supplied to 3500 households. Special consideration will be given to female headed household and PWD. \n4. Livelihood: Improving livelihoods through unconditional cash transfer of USD 70 for 3 months to 333 households, and USD 70 cash assistance for 2 months to 333 households as livelihoods support. The beneficiaries will be selected using robust selection criteria that targets the most vulnerable and prioritise female headed household. The UCT will be done using mobile money transfer which has the benefit of increased security, convenience, privacy, speed, reduced operational/transaction costs and logistics for the beneficiaries and for Islamic relief. Somalia has large mobile network reach. The choice of money gives the beneficiaries the widest range of transactional capabilities and broad access to basic financial services (such as deposit, withdrawal, person-to-person transfers and e-money transactions with registered traders of goods and service providers). Islamic Relief used mobile money in drought/ flood emergency programme (including WFP Baxnaano programme). The lessons from previous experience which guide the choice of UCT include: \n-  Beneficiaries purchase a more diverse set of goods, had higher dietary diversity,\n- Beneficiaries depleted fewer assets and grew more types of crops, especially marginal cash crops grown by women.  They are able to o restock livelihood assets faster. The reasons for this can be attributed to the lower costs and greater privacy of receiving a cash transfer via the mobile transfer, as well as changes in intra-household decision-making.\n5. Establish complaint management and feedback mechanism to the affected population. Through this intervention, IR MEAL unit will ensure that project delivers responses as designed to the affected population. Through an established mechanism of complaints mechanism and feedback channels, the affected population will be made to understand and demand their rights until all is provided to their satisfaction. \n6. Build and establish DRR community champions for covid-19 preparedness, response and treatment. The established committee is trained on covid-19 risk reduction management. Their role is to ensure that community members are made aware of the impact of covid-19, where to seek treatment and how to enforce containment measures such as social distancing and use of mask and sanitisers as part of exposure reduction. \nIRS will lead the implementation. The project will build on existing IRS interventions in health WASH and livelihood sectors and maximise the impact and sustainability",

        "description": "Apart from the other layers of hazards existing in the target areas, COVID-19 had also impacted small scale farmers. It has been reported many farmers have abandoned their farming and sought an alternative source of income from the nearby towns. This has increased and exposed the farmers to the risk of COVID 19. \nA.\tFood security of poor farmers through revitalizing agricultural production in the targeted areas. Through cash for work, irrigation canal will be rehabilitated, and farm inputs will be supplied.  The rehabilitation work will be on excavating (desilting) of flood damaged canals.  This will improve the accessibility and availability of water for irrigation uses. Two canals with dimension of 2m width and 1m depth and 2km length will be rehabilitated. Each canal will provide water to 10 farms. In addition to this, the farmers will receive an improved seed such as maize, sesame, tomatoes and pumpkins.  Availing water and seeds to farmers will improve their farm activities and reduce the risk of seeking labour to unsafe environments. In doing this the farmers will start producing by themselves and subsequently able to both feed their families and sell their produce. The project will link to farmers to the existing potential markets through establishing a network between agriculture traders and target farmer groups.  This activity will be done for 15 days by 200 farmers at a rate of $5 per day. Each farm will be distributed with farm equipment\u2019s worth $200\n\nB.\tIncreased employment opportunity through VSLA and income generating activities:  As COVID 19 had mostly impacted poor and vulnerable people who were dependent on market activities such as labour, aid and family support. In the first phase, the project had transferred cash to maintain the minimum food basket for target households.  The cash had supported families to sustain their livelihoods in specific periods of the project. In order to move to an early socio-economic recovery, on the second phase, the project intends to transition from short term cash transfer to more sustainable income generating activities.  The project will introduce a village, saving and loans association approach (VSLA) to improve access to financial resources for poor households, targeting women in priority. The primary purpose of a VSLA is to provide simple savings and loan facilities and through these and other enabling activities empower women to manage resources and invest them for the benefit of their household. Loans can provide a form of self- insurance to members, supplemented by a saving fund which provides small but important income to members in distress. The VSLA system enables members of a self-selected group to voluntarily save money through purchasing shares. The savings are then invested in a loan fund from which members can borrow as well as meet their immediate needs such as food, water and health care or make further investments to diversify and increase their incomes. The project will support 15 VSLA groups of 15 \u2013 20 members with initial seed fund of 3000 USD for each group. The activity will start with community mobilization, selection of households to participate and group formation. While the methodology is simple, it depends on a very carefully structured system of training. Over seven sessions, groups learn to: form their associations; define a purpose; elect officials; design their system of savings, insurance and credit; and practice running savings and credit meetings. Once this process is completed, VSLAs can begin to save and to lend. They are supervised over a period of 12 months by field staffs who ensure procedures and systems work properly and that the groups can function independently thereafter;\n\nC.\tHealth: Strengthened capacity of existing health facilities and services to combat Covid-19. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to 3 health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections. Other activities also include procurement of medicines, community mobilization outreach and training of frontline health workers. IR will also work with the government hospitals and other unit of covid-19 task force in the preparation of covid roll-out. IR will support through advocacy and media outreach for people to accept and take the vaccines. This approach of advocacy, lobbying through media and electronic information sharing will enable the roll-out of vaccines. IR will also use its health facilities as centre for passing information to patients and their dependents to take up vaccines once its made available. Similarly, IR will by making available a vehicle and a driver support the ministry of health with logistics mainly in Balaad, Baidoa and Bandar districts.\n\nD.\tWASH: The project will expand water points in IDPs. In some IPDs for instance Dayniile district, the accessibility of water stands for handwashing is still very small. The water point will allow beneficiaries to easily access water points for handwashing in their proximity.  The expansion will include laying out of pipes and construction of fenced water points. The expansion will improve the sanitation and hygiene of IDP communities so that they can prevent from themselves the spread of COVID 19 pandemic. The water points will be placed in strategic position such as schools and health centres. Additionally, IR will construct water tanks, piping system, training of water committee with a view to make water available for covid-19 prevention. \n\nE.\tProtection: Since there is a prevailing reports of incidence of gender based violence, early marriage, the project will carry out an awareness sessions including training of women and men. These sessions will be in line with Islamic Relief Somalia safeguarding and protection principles.",

        "description": "Limited access to safe water in Somaliland is endemic and is worsening with prolonged drought. Poor, below-average rainfall in northern and central Somalia during the Deyr season of 2018 has resulted in a harsher than normal dry season. \nMost water sources across Sool and Sanaag regions in the north are not suitable for human consumption and approximately half of the birkads are damaged, and a quarter of them did not harvest any run-off because of the lack of rains. In addition, poor access to latrines leads to prevalent open defecation across Somalia/land. \nThe aim of the proposed project is to provide lifesaving support to and rebuild resilience of affected communities through providing sustainable solutions to water access. Oxfam prioritizes activities that enable communities to access continued water supply from existing groundwater sources, reduce the walking distance for women/girls to fetch water at a reduced cost, contain human feaces contaminating the environment and surface water sources, and promote behavioural change on personal hygiene and handwashing at critical times.\nOxfam is present in hard-to-reach and in some of the most neglected geographical areas of Sool and Sanaag regions and continues to prioritize presence based on where the highest \u2018unreached\u2019 needs lie. There is a committed and robust humanitarian team (over 30+) in Somalia based out of a main office, a field office, and two sub-offices. The current team has strong technical capacity in response management, with technical coordinators for WaSH and a robust 3-person MEAL team that guides quality and accountability of programming in the field. Working with partners on some interventions/responses, also affords good complementarity in understanding the local context and assuring 2-way sharing of technical knowledge and skills that could enrich growth and progress in addressing the needs of the target population. \n\n2 desalination units are proposed in Oog and Garadag. Oxfam will engage in a public private partnership with Boreal Light (which has expertise in operating desalination plants and can provide operation and management training) and the Somaliland Ministry of Water Resource Development (MoWRD). Oxfam already has good relationships and experience with both parties, having closely collaborated around 2 existing desalination units funded in other areas by other donors. The MoWRD supports and endorses desalination work in Somaliland. \n\nBoreal Light is a leading actor in this sector, specialized in renewable energy solutions for water treatment facilities. It manufactures affordable solar water desalination systems and has extensive expertise in the region, including Kenya and Somaliland. It has identified a local agent in Somaliland who will be responsible for operating, maintaining and managing the desalination units under the SHF project for a period 12 months. The training provided in this time will present a sustainable model after the end of the project period. \n\nTo ensure value for money for this funding and program complimentary, ACTED and Oxfam will coordinate on key activities in Sanaag. At project inception, there will be a training workshop on key learning from WASH programming in the region to share experience: e.g. borehole drilling, sharing supplier lists and good practices in drilling and rehabilitation works, engagement with communities and local authorities. Other topics are likely to cover hydreological surveys, desalination and solarization. WASHCO training to be jointly undertaken after asset completion. Cost savings will be on printing materials, vehicle, and stationary. Joint mapping of WASH facilities in El-Afweyn and Ainabo to assess status of available assets, beneficiaries reached and to analyze gaps and investments necessary to provide support. .A joint MampE exercise will be done twice in the project period.",

The SHF activities will complement the CERF emergency health and nutrition activities in the selected locations. The proposed project will also complement DRC's drought-targeted Integrated Emergency Responses in Somalia funded by OFDA. This will enable DRC to provide a complete assistance package to the drought affected communities in selected locations in the North-Western part of Somaliland. The region selected is Awdal which is the most affected region in the north by drought and the Tripical Cyclone Sagar in June 2018, causing displacement and also affecting the strategic water points that communities rely on during the dry spells. Therefore, the WASH assistance package will include - rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures construction of new water infrastructures equipping of boreholes with a hybrid pumping system (solar and generator) and distribution networks establishment of water committee to manage water points and ensure their sustainability. Where appropriate, DRC will partner with private borehole owners to supply water to catchment population and sign a tripartite MOU among the private borehole owner, DRC and Local Authorities. Where there are pressing needs especially in crowded IDP camps and among very vulnerable households, DRC will provide household-shared desludgable latrines. The latrines shall be shared among four (4) households. They shall be installed with hand-wash facility, a ramp to allow for easy access for PLDs especially the ones using a wheelchair and shall be installed with a door lockable from inside to ensure women feel secure while using them. DRC is equally piloting sanitation marketing in the south (Dollow and Baidoa), and will apply lessons learnt from these locations to this project. Overall, with rehabilitation of 5 boreholes,construction of 8 elevated tanks and installation of  portable water tanks DRC targets to reach 59,230 people of which 13623 men, 15400 women, 15400 boys and 14807 girls. This population includes 30% IDPs, 60% host community and 10% returnees. The other groups targeted include people affected by cyclone in Awdal considered the coastal population. With 200 desludgable latrines installed with hand wash facilities and sanitation kits, DRC will also reach 4800 people (1104 men, 1248 women, 1248 boys and 1200 girls) with sustainable access to adequate sanitation facilities.",

According to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), the recent Shabelle river flooding displaced over 270,000 people, of whom 230,000 are in Beletweyne District. Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. According to the FAO-led Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the rains are projected to continue in the coming weeks and it is expected to end in early December. DRC proposes to undertake a life-saving and sustainable assistance to Flood- Displaced people in Beletweyne through provision of emergency shelter kits (ESK), non-food items (NFIs). DRC will target 2050 households (12,300 people) with ESK and NFIs. The standard emergency NFI package will include plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamp and Jerry cans. Where possible, DRC will give the NFIs through cash transfers or vouchers so that beneficiaries can decide based on their needs. DRC will also assist with a standard ESK that contains: Local available stick for vertical post (Philippian Tree) Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philippian Tree) or White wood (8cm x 4cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing or White wood (5cm x 2.5cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) at the base of roof truss or White wood (10cm x 2.5cm size each) Nails No. 5 (5 inch) Nails No. 6 (6 inch) Drum door with frame Hinges for door Local plastic sheet (size: 4m x 7m) and outer wall clothing Buul layer. This provides the most basic shelter which can offer protection from extreme weather. The ESK helps the displaced household to put up by a 4m x 4m shelter structure within the first few days of displacement. DRC is aware that the needs are huge and the available funding cannot cover everyone. DRC is also aware that families of affected persons are normally the first responders and therefore, some families may be better positioned to survive such disaster due to their own social networks. Therefore DRC will develop a selection criteria based on AGD as well as vulnerability to ensure that assistance goes to the ones who deserve it most. Female-headed households, families with many children and the aged (65+ year-olds) will be given priority. DRC will also ensure that, persons living with disabilities (PLDs) or families with such persons are also targeted with assistance.  Families considered extremely vulnerable, will be assisted by DRC to put up their shelter through cash paid after erection. DRC determines that this cash shall be 60 USD and targets 540 hhs out of 2050 hhs. DRC will undertake a post-distribution monitoring (PDM) study four (4) weeks after distribution to measure the effectiveness of distribution and also the satisfaction of the beneficiaries on the items distributed. This will help inform future programming in shelter, NFIs and CCCM programming. Specific to CCCM, DRC shall engage in installation of solar lights and in settlement maintenance including clearance of any solid waste and access roads. DRC will also, jointly with the camp/settlement committees undertake mapping of available services and establish a referral system. Through that, DRC will establish information boards at strategic points like social centers like water points and markets for people to have easy access to information. DRC will support community governance structures through trainings to ensure that camp/settlement committees can manage their daily issues in a structured manner. At sub-national level, DRC will ensure coordination of CCCM meetings happen and deliberations are reported.",

        "description": "Flood triggered displacement is on the rise in Middle Shebelle, with new areas engulfed by floods water during the wet season every day. The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

        "description": "The rains that have inundated parts of Somalia are expected to continue in November with moderate to heavy intensity, according to the FAO Managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM). Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

        "description": "The proposed project seeks to provide emergency lifesaving and life sustaining WASH responses to the flood affected people living in Beledwey. Also this project is working to rehabilitate WASH facilities damaged by the floods including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding. It will contribute to the reduction of emergency WASH gaps reported and works to improve the hygiene practices of the affected communities through kit distribution and awareness campaigns. \nThe project is for 6 months targeting a total beneficiary of 30,000 individuals living in Baldweyn. This reserve allocation will enable QC to scale up flood responses in Beledweyn and reach more beneficiaries in the coming months. \n1.\tThis Project will work to provide emergency water trucking through voucher to flood affected communities in Beledweyn. Currently, potential high-risk areas for the water trucking activities are areas where people are displaced to. A total of 2,500 households equivalent to 15,000 people will be supported  with water voucher for 3 months and each person will be provided 15 l/p/d (acceptable WASH cluster standards in Somalia), with total of 2,520 trucks.\nQC will also provide water to health/nutrition facilities and schools within the target communities. QC will competitively contract water vendors to supply households with agreed quantities over the specified period. Households provided with vouchers will access their allocation of water at the water distribution point on a daily basis. The community water monitors will register the collection of the water in a register book with the household representative and signing or thumb print as a record. All the supplied water will be chlorinated. In addition, a list of recommended boreholes will be mapped out for water trucking. This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

        "description": "The proposed six-month project aims to provide urgent lifesaving assistance to flood-affected communities in Beletweyne while mainstreaming protection and integrating sustainable, flood-resistant solutions. The WASH intervention will improve the health and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in flood-affected communities through increased access to safe water, use of latrines, hygiene promotion and increased adoption of safe hygiene practices. Cash programming, in the form of conditional transfers, vouchers, and cash for work (CfW), will form a core pillar of the proposed intervention. Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

SHF Reserve Allocation and Life-saving response in current and potential hot spots addressing the immediate impact of floods and. Urgent life-saving assistance for communities affected by the floods Address the secondary impacts of flood in the affected areas while also ensuring integration of protection elements and sustainable solutions in all flood response activities. This project will address the dire WASH humanitarian needs for flood-affected communities in Mahaday town of Jowhar district of the Middle Shabelle region through access to safe water, emergency hygiene, and sanitation. The project will address WASH gaps and reduce risks of incidents of AWD/cholera outbreaks, morbidity and mortality among emergency flood-affected communities and vulnerable populations. The project will target 15205 (6234 women, 3802 men, 3101 girls, 2068 boys) including disadvantaged families and elderly persons, Disabilities, children, and women in emergencies to be provided adequate safe water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion services. WASH services of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be promoted in the affected communities by providing adequate WASH facilities such as construction of 435 emergency latrines with handwashing facilities, with lockable doors and with handwashing facilities only in areas where latrine rehabilitation is not possible or where there is a complete gap of sanitation facilities especially in IDP/host communities, provision of WASH packages to vulnerable affected communities, provision of emergency  safe drinking water through CVA (target 700 families with duration of 2 months) and constructing 10 shallow wells with hand pump and rehabilitation of 6 unfunctional shallow wells in Mahaday by focusing on those severely affected by floods. The shallow wells are rehabilitated and upgraded to have protection, including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding with hand pumps installed. SCC will train and recruit 20 (8male, 12 female) Community Hygiene Promoters in Mahaday. The training will be 5-days to promote change the behavior of the beneficiaries through PHAST amp CHAST training components, in close collaboration with the local authorities, community leaders and the ministry of water and energy and ministry of health and social services of Hirshabelle state of Somalia. This project will establish and train 32 (16 Male, 16 Female) water committees that will be selected 2 persons from each water source. A total of 3000 (1350 male, 1650 female) will be distributed to hygiene kits (soap, water treatment tablets, and 20L jerrycans.) A total of 87 flood-damaged latrines will be rehabilitated through CFW modality through selected skilled persons among the flood-affected communities.  a total of 700 families will receive safe drinking water to flood-affected communities through Cash Voucher Assistance (CVA) while water points will be rehabilitated to recover the damaged essential WASH infrastructures and as well as improve the livelihoods of flood-affected communities through CFW modality. The CFW will be used to strengthen WASH market-based programming and this fully in line with Somalia WASH cluster strategy to promote the integration of MBP for all WASH activities. This project will also target 201 women and adolescents girls who affected recent floods providing soap, petticoat, pants, and sanitary pads.",

Already at least 6.3 million people, nearly half of the country\u2019s population are affected by the situation. More than 548,000 people in Somalia have been forced to flee their homes due to flooding in the Hiran region (Belet Weyne, Buuloburto and Jalalaqsi) including children (OCHA report Nov.). Belet Weyne town and the surrounding areas of Hiran region of Somalia is the worst affected where more than 140,000 people are already flee from their homes with empty handed and displaced highland locations, while some households displaced to their relatives living non flood affected areas, putting burden to already vulnerable communities with limited resources (food and water). Authorities and the local community members are trying to mitigate the impact of the floods in residential areas. However, flood risks are still high considering the flow of water to downstream areas of River Shabelle as water levels in Belet Weyne are receding. In this proposal, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in Jalalaqsi district. Under this allocation, AADSOM will improve better access to clean water, use of latrines and increased health promotion and safe hygiene practices to 20,000 women, men, boys and girls including people with disabilities and marginalized communities affected by the current floods. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project include:\n- Provision of safe water to 1000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Upgrade/Rehabilitation of one strategic borehole equipped with hybrid system and rehabilitation of flood damaged 20 shallow wells with hand pumps. \n- Capacity building of 11 WASH committees and 42 Well Operators to ensure continuity of service, operation and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross cutting\n- Construction flood destructed 214 gender separated and flood proof latrines and 6 gender sensitive flood proof institutional latrines in Nasrudin Primary School with lockable doors to avoid GBV against women and girls and washing basin benefiting around 245 students.\n- Conducting comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 20,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers and feeding centers \n-Training 15 community hygiene promoters, who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out and \n-Distribution of 1000 HP kits to 1000 households (UNICEF will supply) with vulnerable populations served by the established water services. \nThe proposed response took into consideration the impact of women, and children in terms of access to WASH services. It takes specific actions to prevent risk of gender-based violence against women/girls by consulting women the appropriate safe locations for the construction of WASH facilities to avoid walking women/girls\u2019 long distance for searching water and their latrine needs.",

The nutrition cluster priority districts in Hiran region including Beletweyne due to critical levels of GAM rate at 19.6 and SAM of 4.1. The project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected populations. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project includes construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health, nutrition and WASH services through the support of static health facilities and mobile outreach to the flood affected populations in Hiran, particularly Beletweyne District. There will be 8 sites that will provide integrated health and nutrition services for flood affected communities, offering outpatient consultations, routine immunization, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTPs, TSFP, IYCF-E and referral to stabilization centers. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will also be provided. Special focus will be given to prevention of disease outbreak and malnutrition, improve early identification malnutrition by empowering mothers to use MUAC screening, access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThe WASH component in health and nutrition will also improve good hygiene practices, rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure, more equitable and better access to sustainable water points for drinking and handwashing with soap, and provision of basic sanitation services in these facilities. Hygiene and sanitation support and promotion will be provided in an integrated approach in the health and nutrition sites. There will also be outreach nutrition, hygiene and health promotion within the community and in schools. This will empower children to be agents of change for hygiene promotion.",

Since inception, the Somalia NGO Consortium has grown as an effective network, actively supporting its members to promote dialogue, collaboration, learning experiences, information exchange and to advocate on issues of key concern. Currently, the Consortium is the primary NGO coordination and representation mechanism, with a membership of 93 national and international NGOs working in all parts of Somalia/Somaliland, around humanitarian, development, peace-building, health, education among other thematic areas.  Governed by a Steering Committee elected by the membership, the SNC provides a platform for information-sharing and representation to governments, UN agencies, donor groups and multilateral organisations at local, national and international levels. The Consortium has offices and representation in Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Garowe, Baidoa, Kismayo and plans to expand its reach to constituencies in the remaining federal states through extensive outreach work from the current offices. The SNC expects to reach 100 NGOs by end of 2019 which will increase membership needs. The SNC is currently co-funded through Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), OFDA (USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and membership subscription fees. Legal and contractual responsibilities associated with funding and contracting are held by host agencies, as SNC is not a legally constituted entity, but rather a network of its membership. During the relocation process in 2019, the SNC has gone through transitions on multiple levels including management and relocation form Nairobi to Mogadishu. Our costs and needs from our membership have significantly increased and significant positions are left unfilled including Advocacy Officer, Deputy Director and Grants amp Partnership Officer. SNC's annual budget for 2020 is estimated to be around $1,409,806 USD. Further information can be found below on budget secured and proposals submitted.",

        "description": "TThe NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO.\n\nIn response to and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed by 4 INGOs and 1 LNGOs), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support.\n\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor Assistants, NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 41,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions, injuries and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs. \n\nThe project budget leans heavily on HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "The overall goal of the project is to contribute to improvement of living conditions and access to basic services for displaced in persons by bolstering effectiveness of coordination mechanisms and community led governance structures in Luuq which is a CCCM under-served area. The envisaged actions will set the foundation for attaining durable solutions through strengthened community self-management. DRC will facilitate the analysis of needs and intervention gaps within IDP sites in Luuq, initiating advocacy for support to respond to identified needs and gaps, as well as protection concerns. DRC will also contribute to the administrating and documenting regular cluster meetings in collaboration with UNHCR. DRC will engage local authorities including governmental and community leadership to work towards durable solutions for displaced populations. \n\nThe project will engage implementing partners and relevant authorities on identified needs, gaps, and overlaps. Furthermore, DRC will advocate for and support the adoption of an area-based approach for service delivery in IDP sites. The project will conduct training of relevant government authorities in CCCM principles to enhance their understanding of humanitarian assistance through the CCCM model.\n\nDRC will take on responsibility for targeted IDP sites to undertake the following:\n- Map out existing governance structures and focal points at the targeted IDP sites. Where governance structures exist, their capacity will be built in camp management and other essential principles. Where these governance structures are absent, DRC will facilitate their establishment through the creation of Camp Management Committees (CMCs).\n- Monitor service delivery in the IDP sites through CCCM Mobile Teams to identify any service gaps and overlaps of interventions by implementing agencies.\n- Reinforce accountability to displaced populations through increasing communication and feedback on availability of services. This will be done through multiple approaches including construction and establishment of community centers for information hubs, and through awareness raising campaigns about site services. Furthermore, DRC will establish and strengthen complaint and feedback mechanisms (CFMs) in sites. For referrals, DRC will work with existing protection stakeholders on appropriate and principled referrals, with particular attention to protection concerns, and service delivery to persons with special needs.\n- Work to improve site safety and hygiene through a participatory approach, utilizing a cash-for-work modality to carry out site maintenance activities. This additionally links participating IDP residents to temporary income and encourages ownership of the site. Site safety audits and fire hazard training will also be conducted.\n\nBeneficiary description:\nThe proposed intervention supports multiple stakeholders through camp management activities at the targeted five IDP sites with the aim of increased coordination at the site level, for displaced populations in  Luuq, where the established governance structures will hold monthly coordination meetings at the site level to discuss gaps and needs of IDP residents so that these identified gaps and needs will be taken  to the relevant humanitarian partners who assist in filling those gaps at the targeted sites.\nAt the present time, based on discussions with relevant stakeholders, DRC has selected the following sites to support:\n1.Ban Munduli (Akaro) - 715 H\u2019H\n2.Buyle - 520 H\u2019H\n3.Luuq Hilaac - 355 H\u2019H\n4.Jazeera - Jadiid - 450 H\u2019H\n5.Luuq Waaberi - 460 H\u2019H",

The project targets 1,350 households comprising of 8,247 boys, girls, women and Men. Project period will be 6 months. The primary target will be the most vulnerable families under the integrated food security classification (IPC) 3 and above that are currently living in  rural Baidoa villages. Target will be mainly villages of northern Baidoa namely Lawiiley (9km), Midow (12km) and Maaranka (15km) and small villages around these three. The assistance will be emergence-oriented agricultural support to 1350 rain fed farmers living in the target villages to secure harvest in the coming Deyr rainy season. The project will provide each family a package of farming seeds (sorghum (30kg) and cowpea (10kg)) and farming tools. The beneficiary farmers will be trained on the best agricultural practice/ good agricultural practice (GAP) to enhance and develop their capacities on farming. \nComplementary unconditional cash transfer (UCT) will be transferred to the target beneficiaries in a period of 3 months to improve immediate food access during the lean season. The monthly rate of the cash transfer is $30/family. This complies with March 2019 minimum expenditure basket (MEB) value recommended by CMWG in May 2019. It is anticipated that the cash transfer support will improve their food consumption, nutritional status of the children and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms that exposes women, children and other vulnerable groups to the risk of displacement. \nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and drought affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance.",

This is achieved through provision of unconditional cash transfer, Conditional cash transfer (cash for work) and provision of seasonally appropriate agricultural inputs to 2,200 households,  which is 13,200  most affected people (3,617 women, 3,734 men, 2,913 boys and 2,926 girls) in 20 villages in Elbarde (10) and Xudur (10) district to cover immediate food needs during lean season ( August \u2013 December 2019),restore productive livelihoods  and prevent further displacements. ACF will prioritize the most nutritionally vulnerable groups (labour poor and those unable to participate in the Cash for Work Program) including pregnant and lactating women, malnourished infants and young children under 5, disabled, chronically ill, elderly and child headed households with no external support for the unconditional cash assistance (800 hhs) to meet immediate basic needs combating rising cases of acute and morbidity related malnutrition. ACF will engage further 800 vulnerable HHS (female-headed Pastoral drop out, lost asset, no income, marginalized/minority communities) for conditional cash transfer (CFW) with at least one member of the household able to undertake manual labour. The CFW serve as short-term employment for the targeted HHS to provide cash to meet basic needs and rehabilitate productive infrastructures (farmland, water catchment, rangeland rehabilitation) to support restoration of productive livelihoods activities.The beneficiaries  (600 hhs) are further linked to benefit from emergency agricultural support seasonally appropriate agricultural inputs.

        "title": "Providing Emergency Unconditional Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Households in Diinsoor",
        "description": "The underperforming Deyr rains in 2018 and Gu rains in 2019 have heavily impacted the lives and livelihoods of households in Diinsoor which has led to an increase in the number of households in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and IPC Phase 4 (emergency). Rural populations in the hard-to-reach and undeserved areas around Diinsoor have been severely affected as result of poor agricultural production and limited access to services due to limited coverage by aid agencies. Household debt levels in this area remain high with many households utilizing negative coping mechanisms as a means to survive this lean period. Findings from a rapid needs assessment conducted by ACTED in Diinsoor on 16 and 23 June found that 62% of households do not regularly meet their food needs. Due to this dire situation, ACTED proposes an emergency short-term response to address the acute food insecurity and alleviate the humanitarian needs. The project will provide life-saving support to 1,614 vulnerable and drought affected households (9,684 individuals) through unconditional cash transfers in Diinsoor. ACTED plans to distribute four-months of consecutive unconditional cash transfers to these households from August until November 2019. Overall, these activities align with the Food Security cluster objective to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phase vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods. Moreover, the project aligns with the Somalia HRP 2019 objective to provide life-saving and life sustaining integrated assistance to reduce acute humanitarian needs and excess mortality among the most vulnerable people. Unconditional cash transfers act as a measure to prevent further deterioration of the food security of households and act as a buffer against the continued impact of the failed rains. These unconditional transfers in Diinsoor provide a quick response to increasing needs and enable households to access the functioning markets in Diinsoor.",

Woccas nutrition and health sectors will employ an integrated strategy to support recovery of severely malnourished persons, prevent deterioration while boosting access to essential healthcare services. We will target pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children below 5 years (CU5) in the host community, IDPs and returnees  in Adale where we are the secondary rationalized partner. In Adale we will operate 1 static outpatient therapeutic feeding center (fixed OTP) and 2 mobile outpatients therapeutic feeding programme teams (mobile OTPs) targeting 8 locations chosen on the basis of vulnerability and absence of nutrition interventions in the district. The static facility will be established in Cadale town area while the 2 outreach teams will serve 8 locations namely Ceel Xarar, Ceel Yaag, Boos Hareri, Buro Sheikh, Garas Dhagey, Janab, Gudgudud and Gacal Nur. We will engage UNICEF/WFP for backstopping during training of the project staff, community health workers (CHWs) and mothers for the \u201cmothers MUAC approach\u201d, on nutrition screening and case identification, Integrated management of acute malnutrition(IMAM),Infant and young child feeding education (IYCF-E) and Nutrition, health and hygiene promotion (NHHP).The trained staff will be deployed to the targeted locations, mobile/static OTPs where together with the trained mothers will screen CU5 and PLWs. CU5 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) conditions will be enrolled in the static/mobile OTPs for nutrition and medical rehabilitation. CU5 and PLW with MAM conditions will be referred to TSFP centers. We will open 2 fixed TSFP/BSFP centers, one in Adale town and the other in Haji Cali to be integrated with a fixed nutrition centers operated by WOCCA. Hygiene promoters will be trained on Nutrition, Health and Hygiene Promotion (NHHP), they will disseminate hygiene promotion messages to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera. Mothers will be counseled by trained nutrition staff and CHWs on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. We will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MMNs) and Vitamin A supplements to PLW and CU5 through the static/mobile facilities. A referral system will be put in place to transfer patients from one component to the next (when the patient condition worsens), or to return to the previous one if the evolution of treatment is satisfactory. In order to boost access to essential healthcare services, we will borrow from the successes of our ended IERT project We will upgrade, equip and properly staff the fixed nutrition centers to provide basic health services to malnutrition affected population by providing access to treatment of common childhood diseases and Health care support to PLW (including ANC and PNC), and EPI. Efforts to improve vaccination in drought-affected and marginalized populations will be integrated into fixed and mobile service delivery mechanisms.  doctors and nurses will be hired for the nutrition centers. emphasis will also be given to social mobilization campaigns to educate communities on common health issues and support implementation of community hygiene Promotion for epidemic outbreak Prevention.

The target group will be selected from those impacted by drought with limited humanitarian support due to access difficulties and blockade. \n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable such as the marginalized, unaccompanied children, older persons, persons with disability, single women, pregnant and lactating mothers, single headed-households, persons with chronic illness or psychological condition, large families and/or families with babies, toddlers or children attending school, persons at risk as identified by protection officers and those living in the open or in makeshift buuls without adequate access to shelter. The project team will undertake a vulnerability assessment involving documenting of household profiles in the target area to identify the most vulnerable who are in urgent need for shelter assistance. Data will be collected through a number of methods including structured interviews with households heads, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and direct site observation. Collected data to inform beneficiary selection will also be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area as needed to avoid overlap. Mindful of the Somali context and utilizing its expertise in target locations, AVORD will pay attention to issues of diversity in the targeting process. \n\nFollowing need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries, AVORD will provide affected households with standard NFI kits comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, I Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Torch and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. The proposed content in each set is based on current Shelter Cluster standards for people in humanitarian emergencies. Since there are no functioning NFI markets in No.50, AVORD will use an in-kind modality for provision of NFIs. Besides, emergency shelters will be constructed for newly displaced households living in the open or under deplorable shelter conditions. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with relevant line ministries of the South West Administration and No.50 District Authorities to secure land tenure for a minimum of 5 years before the construction of emergency shelters.\n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.\n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek Integration with other clusters and own interventions in the region to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

The action is in line with the SHF reserve allocation 2019 hence targeting one of the most undeserved communities in hard to reach areas as prioritized by the call for proposals. Specifically, the project will enable INTERSOS to fill the WASH gaps through provision of sustainable WASH assistance package including innovative solutions that can contribute to durable solutions. \n\nThe overall objective of this response is to provide Sustainable life-saving WASH services to the most vulnerable in Diinsoor district to improve access to safe and sustained water and hygiene educations, reduce acute watery diarrhea AWD/cholera incidences and WASH related diseases through Drilling and equipping of one strategic borehole with solar-diesel hybrid pumping system that will help in lowering the cost of system operation and more importantly lower emission of carbon footprint. Hydrogeological survey will be conducted in Dinsoor town to identify the suitability of ground water. Complete water distribution networks with elevated tanks and water consumption points (water kiosks) will be installed and constructed as per the available designs and BOQs. All water construction works will be constructed through service contracts with reputable water infrastructure companies who will be supervised by INTERSOS Engineer based in Diinsor. INTERSOS will employ local specialised manpower in order to rehabilitate and develop 11 existing shallow-wells through construction and raising of concrete aprons, de-silting to increase the yield of the wells, India mark 2 water pumps will be installed to ease fetching, watering trough will be built to separate the human consumption from livestock water consumption. \n\nMoreover, INTERSOS will introduce manual drilling of wells that are located in the water bed of the water streams or seasonal with pvc pumps. 11 wells will be drilled using this innovative technic. 3 local technicians will be trained and will be given materials and tools to support the population and start a sustainable and profitable business. The safety of water will be guaranteed through water treatment at the water sources while training of water management committees will embed sustainability through improved operations and management and cost recovery measures, water quality monitoring at the source and household level and where necessary will provide remedial measures through awareness raising on safe water handling by regularly conducting sanitary surveys to suspected water sources to identify risk factors, treatment options like chlorination will be done during rehabilitation and development of these wells and boreholes. \n\nIn addition, the project will address the sanitation and hygienic behavior among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion and provision of hygiene kits to 1000 households, distribution of water purification tablets to acute watery diarrhea AWD/cholera suspected homes, institutional hygiene promotion. Hygiene promotion will be built on people\u2019s own knowledge of risk and disease prevention to promote positive health-seeking behaviour. \n\nINTERSOS is currently the only INGO present in Diinsor and the only humanitarian actor implementing wash programs in the District as described in the paragraph coordination and complementarities, majority of the sanitation activities will be conducted in the same targeted location through a project funded by the Italian Cooperation moreover, this project will contribute to a nutrition outcome since INTERSOS will enhance complementarities in the same area with an ongoing nutrition project funded by SHF (a scale up of the same project being discussed with UNICEF).\n\nA total of 21800 (5,308 women, 5,376 men, 5,200 girls and 5,916 boys) are expected to benefit from this project action.",

        "description": "FSNAU post deyr 2018 assessment indicated critical levels of acute malnutrition among rural and pastoral populations with critical GAM gt15 and Serious SAM rates reported in Bakool region. The ongoing Gu rains 2019 (April to June) started late and have performed poorly and are likely to further aggravate the vulnerability of drought affected population including IDPs, poor host communities in Elbarde in Bakool region. These IDPs and poor host communities experience limited access to basic services including access to WASH services. The contributing factors include drought, dry jilaal season (January \u2013March 2019), displacement coupled poor WASH infrastructure. The prolonged drought in Bakool region led to limited access to sustained safe drinking water and increased risks related to  acute water diarrhea and malnutrition among population in Elbarde district in Bakool region. \nAccording to HIDIG WASH assessment conducted between 27- 28 May  2019 indicated that majority of affected population (80%) in ELBARDE district can't afford the cost of water due to increased price of water (55% increase) exposing thousands of families to walk more than 45 minutes for water collection which expose women and adolescent girls risks for gender-based violence. The assessment report indicated that, between 70-80% of shallow wells (26/38 wells in the assessed locations) are on open source condition and hence expose to contamination of water and to increases incidences of AWD cases. In addition, HIDIG/UNICEF health facility report in May 2019 indicated that AWD and skin diseases were among top five disease reported. To respond this alarming situation, the proposed project will improve access to WASH services for a total of 23000 drought/AWD affected communities (including 5750 women , 6900 girls, 6900 boys and 3450 men) IDPs and host communities in Elbarde district in Bakool region. The organization proposes sustained solution to improve access to WASH services services of the affected people in line with Somali WASH cluster response plan:\nWater: 1. Provision of sustained access to safe drinking water to through construction/rehabilitation of one boreholes equipped with hybrid and supplied water to two kiosks through piping system to two kiosks. Extension and construction of water supply systems in IDP camps benefiting 12000 drought affected men, women, girls and boys in Elbarde district. \n2. Construction/ rehabilitation of 12 shallow wells with hand pumps benefiting at least 11000 drought /AWD affected communities in Elbarda district \n3.  To ensure the sustainability and the management of water facilities, HIDIG will ensure to enhance the capacity of WASH committees to keep the maintenance and operation of the water source after the project is faced out.  HIDIG will ensure the maintenance and the appropriate use of water facilities in close coordination and coordination with IDPs mainly camp committees (men and women). \nSanitation :Construct 100 flood proof gender sensitive desludging latrines with hand washing facilities and with inside and outside lockable door to ensure the privacy of women and girls. around men, women and children are equally\n Hygiene promotion activities : HP will carry out comprehensive hygiene and sanitation promotion awareness campaign to promote the adaption of good hygiene and sanitation practices to affected men, women and children. \nSustainability : The rehabilitated  water sources (boreholes) will also serve as the main water supply sources to support neighboring villages with water trucking in the recent dry seasons.ill .The propose WASH investments will help affected communities in accessing sustainable water sources and eventually  reduce the impact of recurrent droughts ,climate shocks and improve their resilience in long run",

According to the FSNAU- FEWS NET- Post Deyr Technical release IN Feb 2019, more than 1.5 million people will face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) through June 2019 and an additional 3.4 million people are classified as Stressed (IPC 2), which brings the total number of people in Somalia facing acute food insecurity through mid-2019 to 4.9 million. In addition, 903,100 children under the age of five years will likely face acute malnutrition in 2019, including 138,200 who are likely to be severely malnourished. \n\nTension and occasional clashes between Somaliland and Puntland over the contested Sool and Sanaag regions has led to displacement of more than 1000 households to nearby locations. According to reports from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency, the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume anytime. Baidoa district is one of the main hubs for IDPs and presents critical gaps in terms of humanitarian coordination and information as well as service provision. Drought conditions combined with a proliferated conflict with Al Shabab has exacerbated displacement. An estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance, including Baidoa and Sanaag IDPs. Conditions for IDPs are likely to deteriorate unless humanitarian support is scaled-up. \n\nIn the presented context, through CCCM, ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement these activities in 42 IDP sites in both Sanaag and Baidoa 39 previously supported IDP sites in Baidoa (ref: SOM-18/3485/SA1/CCCM-WASH-Shelter/INGO/8671) to build on the gains achieved through the SHF integrated support by focusing on capacity building, self-management and handover of activities to communities 3 new IDP sites (Karasharka, Fadhigaab, El-Midgaan) in El-Afweyne district of Sanaag, targeting a largely undeserved area. 6,443 HHs (approximately 38,658 people) in Baidoa and 1,222HHs (approximately 7,332 people) in Sanaag, a total of 7,665HHs will benefit from this intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas.",

People displaced to informal sites do not have their basic needs met due to the inconsistent provision of services or exclusion from accessing humanitarian support as a result of poor targeting of sites. This project seeks SHF allocation towards the strengthening camp coordination and camp management in order to ensure equitable access to services and protection for displaced persons in Banadir region. Majority of IDPs in Banadir region settle in informal and unplanned settlements where the conditions are very poor and forced eviction is a common threat, and where newly displaced people join those whose displacement has become protracted. Many are displaced multiple times. CCCM will strengthen the predictability and effectiveness of multi sectorial interventions at site level through continuous mapping of displacement settings, improved community participation and continuous monitoring.\n\nNoFYL is aware of challenges existing around land and property tenure arrangements, including customary access rights to land when selecting sites for the construction of the community centers. Where the land or property is privately held, NoFYL will consult with relevant stakeholders to obtain authorization and a long term formal agreement from owners to ensure long term sustainability of project constructions. \n\nThrough this project, NoFYL will reach 4,203 HHs in 7 IDP settlements with a total target beneficiary of 19,218 in Deynille and Kaxda districts with necessary services through coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stake holders and other partners.

During the course of project duration, AVORD will also distribute a range of tools for effective disaster and solid waste management. Critical site infrastructure including 240 latrines and 40 main gates will be upgraded to minimize protection risks and enhance safety at sites. In the selection of beneficiaries for cash-for-work activities, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

        "description": "The education system has suffered widespread loss and damage, resulting in limited capacity and resources.\nAccess to education has reached a historic low, with more than three million children today out of schools in Somalia. The national Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) is 30 per cent for primary education and 26 per cent for secondary level education (HRP 2019 report). \nThe project intends to target 16 IDP sites in Baidoa town. The identified camps are among the 391 IDP camps which were in great majority set up during 2017 and which are home to 47,873 HHs (CCCM report, DSA, March 2019). \nThis project aims to achieve access to education for IDP children by targeting 2,185 out of school children (1,090 boys and 1,095 girls) living inside IDP settlements in Baidoa to ensure their access to school thus enhancing their safety and protection as well as the enjoyment of their rights. Out of the total 2,185 children, 2,060 are primary school age children while 125 are secondary school age children and/or children above 15 years.\nThis project will ensure that emergency and crisis affected children/youth have access to safe and protective learning environments in the partner schools. This will be done through a comprehensive action to respond to immediate and longer term needs of the children. The learners will be provided with access to food, water and scholastic material and children with protection concerns will be supported through strengthening/creating referral mechanisms where necessary, to specialized services. Girl  education will be at the center of the project encompassing all activities and it will be promoted with trainings, advocacy campaigns and community mobilization in support of changing negative attitudes and practices. Adolescent school aged girls will also be provided with sanitary pads in support to improving their attendance rates in classrooms and CECs will be sensitized on the importance of girls\u2019 education during the back to school campaigns. Personal hygiene and sanitation, school personnel and parents\u2019 commitment to provide leadership in promoting girls\u2019 education are proven to be two key factors in improving girls\u2019 attendance rates as recommended by the beneficiaries during FGDs held by INTERSOS staff in the current SHF EiE project implemented din Wajid and Education Cannot Wait project implemented last year in Baidoa. \nThe foreseen construction and rehabilitation of temporary learning spaces will ensure access to a safe and enabling learning environment. Additionally, capacity building will be conducted for CECs and teachers on pedagogy, child protection, child wellbeing and psychosocial support. Teachers will also be supported through payment of monthly incentives corresponding to 100 USD for a period of 8 months. \nAmong the 16 targeted settlements, the 3 IDP camps located within the Horseed urban village called Shimo Tiyeglow, Kalimey and Bohaladi will be provided with two new learning spaces and segregated gender latrines since no education service is present in this area. \nChild protection is mainstreamed into the project. One of the key focus of the project will be indeed to prevent and respond to children with protection concern considering the school as a safe space and an entry point to enhance children\u2019s protective environment. The project will conduct regular analysis of the situation of children regarding causes and patterns of protection concerns and will respond accordingly through prevention and strengthening or creating quick referral pathways, conduct service mapping to facilitate appropriate referrals and strengthen coordination and linkages in service delivery to ensure quality comprehensive services to the children with protection concerns.\n Building communities\u2019 resilience and promoting the reintegration of children in the formal education system. In 2018 INTERSOS already successfully referred and supported 117 children to the public schools Mustafa Sheik and Sahal Moalim.",

Child protection focal points will be recruited at schools while all schools will have active child to child clubs. The purpose of these activities are to promote the safety and protection of students at schools, make school safe and child-friendly zone and identify and support children with protection and psychosocial support. This will also cultivate a culture that respects child rights and promotes their protection. \n\nThe ultimate aim of the project is to ensure greater access in safe learning environment and improved learning for children affected by emergencies to reduce violence, avoid further marginalization and loss of another generation. \n\nIn order to improve the quality of education, teachers will be trained on child-centered teaching methods and psycho-social support, and given emergency incentives.  Community Education Committees (CECs), local authorities and partners will be trained on psycho-social support skills, emergency preparedness, contingency planning and related issues. The proposed intervention will also improve the education authorities\u2019 and CECs capacity to plan for and respond to education in emergency situations.\n\nThe project will target and support a total of 6750 students, 120 teachers and 140 CEC members.Beneficiaries will be selected through participatory and predetermined selection criteria prioritizing the most affected and needy people and 48% will be girls. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age and diversity dis-segregated data. \n\nThe project will be directly implemented by NRC in collaboration with Puntland State ministry of Educations and Education clusters.

Abuses such as physical assault, recruitment of children into militias, abduction, high drop-out cases have been reported by a number of agencies all of which gravely affect learning processes. \n\nThe project is designed to reach IDP children of school going ages to: \n1) Provide immediate child protection for the most vulnerable children through awareness creation and support to the child to child clubs \n2) Increase resilience through the provision of basic education and support to school-based resilience mechanisms that will contribute to the sustainability of education programs\n3) Build the capacities of teachers and CECs to better respond to child protection issues and better manage school resources.\n\nThe project targets 8 primary schools in Bay region affected by the protracted crisis in South West State. READO in response to emergency-affected learners in the larger Somalia has proposed this project to mainly retain 3051 learners (1434 girls) and 48 teachers (24 female) and 28 CECs (14 female) at school in mitigating the case of high school dropout rate following effects of prolonged drought crisis. The project will focus on the provision of quality learning opportunities through\n Provision of quality Teaching and Learning Materials in 8 public primary schools\n Water provision in 8 schools and complimentary food provision in 8 public primary schools targeted aimed at improving the quality of learning by contributing to physical and mental growth of learners.\n Providing teacher incentives to 48 teachers and head teachers spread over the 8 targeted schools aimed at improving the quality of life.\nProviding protective learning environments for most vulnerable learners through\n Training of 48 teachers and 28 CECs on child protection issues including PSS, DRR spread over the 8 targeted schools.\n Rehabilitation of 8 classrooms in the 4 Primary schools targeted.\n Rehabilitation 8 separate gender appropriate latrines,12 hand washing facilities, 3 water tanks for three schools.\nAnd build the capacities of teachers and CECs to better manage school resources with a focus on finding sustainable solutions through\n Training of 48 teachers and 28 CECs on management of school resources\n Establish child to child clubs at school, referrals of cases, tracing and unification.\nREADO will manage to address Education concerns brought about by the drought in the schools that READO has been supporting with the help of volunteer teachers. This will also act as entry points to address other emergency related concerns like AWD outbreaks in schools, school health screening and aid provision challenges. \nBy implementing this work in such a manner, READO is ensuring to not only build up the resilience, capacity and education opportunities available to vulnerable groups in Baidoa, but to improve the capacity, coordination and cooperation between the different groups and administrations within the city.",

Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, safe water delivery to schools, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines and water storage tanks. Specific Protection activities will include case management for separated and unaccompanied children and GBV survivors, mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, linking schools to referral pathway outside the school and facilitating the development of school-level child protection action plans. Relief International (RI), through child protection committees, will deliver messages to schools and communities on key protection concerns affecting the community. These messages will target prevention as well as the response in the event protection concerns arise. RI will also continue to engage with relevant government ministries such as the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MoEampHE) and the Office of Puntland Human Rights Defenders. RI will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in the targeted schools, RI will truck safe water to all 31 schools but CECs will manage its distribution. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacities and improve school preparedness against future disasters. Child- and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. RI will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. RI, in collaboration with the appropriate ministries, will map existing referral pathways and service providers and link schools to these services. Where pathways are weak or non-functional, RI will strengthen them to ensure effective response to child protection concerns. To monitor the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, RI will facilitate joint review workshops with schools, service providers, and relevant government ministries. Through engagement with ministry officials such as MoEampHE Gender Focal Points, Office of Puntland Human Rights Defender and CECs, RI will leverage the respective agency apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established referral mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools and the larger communities.",

        "description": "The detrimental effects of underperforming rains are impacting the parts of population that is still trying to recover from the effects of an extended drought in northern and central Somalia. The deteriorating food security outlook, combined with the worsening malnutrition calls for a rapid and well-targeted scale up of response to save lives and support recovery. The project is aimed at improving the ability of vulnerable HHs to meet their basic needs, supports protection and recovery of livelihood assets through life-saving UCT, animal treatment services and emergency fodder provision in Burco district Togdheer region. The project targets 1137 vulnerable drought affected pastoralist HHs including women, men, boys, girls, and female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The drought has severely and directly affected pastoral communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk. This has led to household food insecurity, sharp increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and animal use. Additionally, the drought affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debt and therefore not able to purchase veterinary drugs, fodder and water, which is essential when livestock body condition is so poor thus susceptible to opportunistic diseases.\n\nCOOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation, the beneficiary women, girls and the disabled will be included in decision making processes, monitoring so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, unconditional cash transfer will be provided to 1137 drought affected pastoralists HHs including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services. \n\nTo protect key livelihoods assets of pastoralists, livestock belonging to 400 vulnerable pastoralists HHs (including female headed) affected by drought who cannot afford costs for livestock drugs and treatment services will be provided with treatment. This activity will prevent deaths and reduction in production through treatment of livestock against bacterial infections. Moreover, emergency fodder provision for core breeding herd belonging to 200 HHs during stress periods will prevent losses and ensure milk availability for children. The activity is aimed at protecting livestock assets of the drought affected pastoral communities from starvation, opportunistic infections and death. This activity is envisaged to reduce workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, GBV  and exploitation associated with searching of livestock feed and transporting fodder for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed livestock feed provision\nIn summary the following activities will be carried out:\n1. Provide unconditional cash to 1137 HH. 2.) Provide livestock treatment support for 400 HH. 3.) Emergency fodder provision for core breeding herd belonging to 200 HHs during stress periods to prevent losses and ensure milk availability for children.",

        "description": "Though the food security and livelihoods situation improved due to good performance of 2018 Gu rain in most part of Somalia, the poor performance of Deyr 2018 rainfall coupled with Sagar Cyclone along the coastal region deteriorated the food and livelihoods situation in poor households. \nThe project targets the Coastal areas in Awdal region which are predicted to receive below normal and near normal rainfall which will realize water availability and pasture regeneration that will not sustain them through the long dry spell period, necessitating continued humanitarian and livelihoods support to bridge the gaps in these periods.\nIn response to the deteriorating food security condition and humanitarian need, VSF Germany is seeking to up-scale the current OCHA \u2013SHF funded intervention in Awdal region by targeting additional beneficiaries in districts which are currently not covered by the ongoing project and also extend to one additional district .The up scaling Action will thus cover  Zeylac district( a new district),thus covering 3 districts in Awdal Region, Somaliland . \nThe designed Action is a humanitarian response to improve immediate food access, restore and prevent further deterioration of food security and livelihoods of vulnerable households in target project locations. This overall goal of the response is to contribute towards improving food access and availability, animal health, livestock productivity and livelihoods restoration. This in turn will enable beneficiary households to get access to milk, income, food and enhance nutritional status of their families including children. VSF Germany will closely work with other humanitarian actors in the areas to avoid duplication of efforts through regular coordination and monitoring of similar activities at field level and build synergies. This up-scaling Action is expected to benefit a total of 650 households (3,900 individuals) in the target district (Zeylac). Specific intervention include: Provision of unconditional cash transfer (for immediate food access) Animal health services (treatment and vaccination campaign) (to protect and restore livelihoods).Animal health services will be delivered in partnership with Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development (MoLFD). Thus, implementation of these key interventions in the target areas would yield multiple benefits 1) prevent vulnerable households from employing negative coping strategies and, 2) restore the livelihoods and due to healthy and nourished animals hence improved milk availability and 3) prevent loss of key household assets and thus build resilience of target community . The target households will also be linked with local veterinary drug shops and Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW) in order to get required animal health services. The Action is aligned with the standard allocation strategies and food security cluster objective 1 to improve the immediate access to food objective 2, to protect and restore livelihoods related to food and income sources and objective 3, to support resilience of vulnerable populations against shocks.",

        "description": "The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2019 and the 1st 2018 SHF Standard Allocation for the Food Security and Livelihood as it applies to project planned target District of Hobyo (South Mudug Region). The project will provide lifesaving support to 7,704 people assessed to be in acute food insecurity, \u2018Crisis\u2019 and \u2018Emergency\u2019 phases of IPC (3 and 4)  by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and safety net support.\n\nThe project proposes lifesaving interventions that are gender sensitive, adapt centrality of protection and that mainstream gender and protection in the delivery methods proposed. The project will specifically prioritize destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the two Districts) and other households as identified in the Hobyo Districts that fall into the IPC 3 and 4. The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the failure of the Deyr 2018 season rains in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project seeks to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food to 733 vulnerable households through Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) for 3 months with each household being entitled US $71 as per MEB for Mudug Region. The project will undertake a vulnerability assessment in selected locations of the targeted 4 locations in the District (2 settlements with IDPs and 2 settlements with high number of vulnerable host households) with the findings being used in developing the criteria for selection of the planned UCT beneficiaries and informing on protection needs.  Priority for the UCTs beneficiaries will be given to women-led households from the most vulnerable among recently displaced, non-displaced and socially marginalized communities in each of the respective target District. The UCTs planning will also be supported by a market analysis undertaken in the District (undertaken by the FSL Team) to determine the capacity of local markets to absorb the resources extended to the beneficiaries. \n\nIn addition the project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 451 unskilled laborers rehabilitating 3 Water Pans.  Each unskilled labourer of the planned 410 CfW laborers shall get $ 5 per day for 30 days and 41 skilled laborers at the rate of US 7. A total of 6,000 CUM water impounding capacity will be added to the current existing 1,080 CUM in the 3 targeted dams in Hobyo District. The project will also support the protection of the core breeding and milking herds normally under the care of women in the rural and urban settlements through supportive treatments. This will involve the creation of the requisite animal treatment capacity (currently missing) involving the provision of fixed value animal treatment vouchers.  A total of 1,000 animals in the district are targeted where each HH is estimated to be keeping 10 Shoats. A total of 100 HHs will be targeted in the District. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure that the project gets feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and arising gaps that will require humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below average rainfall for the coming Gu 2019 season as indicated by FEWSNET in its January 2019 update.\n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular helps make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project to ensure it provides the women safety and protection required.",

HIDIG will leverage of its ongoing WASH and nutrition activities to provide access to an integrated life-saving health services to an estimated 21,000 drought affected and urban poor host communities in Baidoa district through one static health facilities, and six mobile clinics, with a focus on maternal and child Health in partnership with the Ministries of Health and other healthcare service providers. The SHF funds will be used to support a critical response integrated with WASH and nutrition to respond to the health needs of malnourished children and women in Baidoa. The proposed response aims to respond to only areas with critical rates of malnutrition and measles and suspected AWD/Cholera hotspots where immediate provision of lifesaving emergency healthcare is intended to be carried out. For example, Bay region accounts for 48% of all measles cases in South Somalia which make up five regions. HIDIG implemented health project in Baidoa district in partnership with SHF in 2018, which has ended. To build on the gains achieved in 2018 and the ongoing routine immunization support from UNICEF, the proposed project will provide free emergency obstetric care including ANC, skilled delivery and PNC to 1,050 eligible women and improve referral system through provision of timely transportation. Overall, 21,000 direct beneficiaries, including 5,040 girls, 4,200 boys, 6,510 women, 5,250 men will benefit from the services. The organization will conduct routine and supplementary measles immunization targeted at children under-five in target areas. In addition, the capacity of 35 staff will be improved through training so that frontline staff in disaster events marked by a sudden or gradual increase in demand for healthcare services and a related decrease in the supply of resources available to provide such care can act. This will result in a community healthcare-sector response that can implement a variety of surge capacity strategies that include steps taken to reduce demand for care, e.g., the implementation of community-based triage capabilities and risk communication about when to seek care and the strengthening of referral care capacity in addition to better described inpatient care strategies. In this context, fifty community members will also obtain an increased knowledge and skills on community management of childhood illnesses. HIDIG is an active health cluster member in Bay, Bakol and Hiiraan regions and will actively share information with the cluster, UNOCHA and the Ministry of Health, both at state level and federal. The target district is accessible, and the organization has an active PCA with UNICEF in reducing maternal mortality rate through skilled deliveries and strengthening referral system in Somalia. These proposed interventions adhere to the SHf\u2019s life-saving criteria as they respond to time-critical requirements and contribute to reducing the loss of lives. Bay region has more than 12,000 people in IPC 4 and 176,000 in IPC 3, indicating the scale of the acute malnutrition in the region. Because of this, HIDIG requires support and additional resources are urgently required as health and nutrition facilities are seeing more people in need. HIDIG will coordinate its interventions with respective line ministries and other NGOs to ensure there is no duplication in the response and that critical gaps are covered",

KAALO proposes to scale up its health interventions to save lives, mitigate emergencies, reduce mortality amp morbidity and fill gaps of health services for drought affected people through 2 fixed health facilities with two mobile clinics targeting 28,000 direct beneficiaries including (7000 WCBA, 5600 children under five) in Sool region. The  sexual and reproductive health SRH intervention consists in supporting the provision of basic and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services to all people at target districts and ensuring particularly the good health and well-being of mothers and newborns. This is done by supporting national health facilities in strengthening the health system strategy, equipping conflict-affected health facilities with emergency reproductive health kits, training health workers IMCI, BEmOC for reproductive health and deploying mobile teams in hard-to-reach areas to directly support the provision of services. Qualified nurses/ midwives will provide preventative and curative services, antenatal care, skilled delivery, postnatal care, treatment of common illnesses. The child health services include immunization of children under five years and promotion services including health education, growth monitoring, de-worming and supplementation with vitamin A. The mobile health teams will provide primary health Services for undeserved and hard to reach areas. They will also provide basic mental health and Psychosocial Support services and referral services. At the end of the project , a total of 28000 affected community (7000 women, 8400 girls, 8400 boys and 4200 men) improved and increased availability of health care including: promotive, preventative and curative services , reproductive health  and improved case management of childhood illnesses through two fixed health facilities with mobile outreach teams in Sool region.",

Only about 26 per cent of Somalis have antenatal care coverage, and the number of necessary emergency care facilities for obstetrics is 0.8 per 500,00 people.  This means the number of facilities is 4.2 facilities short of the international standard of five facilities per 500,000 people.\nPregnancy or childbirth-related complications such as hemorrhage, obstructed labour, infection, high blood pressures and unsafe abortion are the main contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality in Somalia.\nThe health needs of the IDPs and the vulnerable urban poor of the host community in Qardho is very acute given the overstretched nature of limited resources due to the influx of IDPs, returnees and refugees. \nIn this project, Qatar Red Crescent Society will improve the access and utilization of Emergency PHC services for women and children living in the most crisis affected populations in Qardho IDP settlements and the vulnerable urban poor in Qardho.

        "description": "The Nutrition and health situation remains fragile in Hobyo with children and women being most vulnerable. The key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional health system. Tied to that is minimal capacity available in the nutrition and health sector and  poor community literacy levels  (UNICEF 2018 WHO 2017). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease (UNICEF,2018, FSNAU,2018).\n Although there has been progress noted in service provision and policy development in Somalia including: roll out of national development plan with inclusion of a section on Nutrition and mainstreaming it to sectors (SNDP,2017), 2017-20 health sector strategic plan (FMoH,2017) and other health related policies, frameworks and guidelines,a lot still needs to be done to actualized these.\nIts important to note that disparities in health outcomes among Somali children and women still exist. These are based on: their exposure to violence and insecurity, access, gender and ethnic groupings, and the stability of communities/clan structure. Addressing these inequities, remains a priority (UNICEF,2018). This brings to light the fact that the situation in Hobyo  could be worse than national statistics considering that factors mentioned above fully exist here.\nServices in Hobyo barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure and harsh climate conditions. Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2018SAF UK,2018 SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2019). There are reports of drought and food shortages causing many to leave there homes in search of food and water. The is therefore need for urgent attention if the situation is to be controlled.\nGender issues that lock out significant others increasing negative social pressure on women not to adapt behaviors beneficial to health, should be addressed for positive nutrition outcomes to be realized. Finally capacity of service providers and locals communities to control malnutrition should be improved for quality service, resilient communities and sustainable projects.\nThe proposed interventions will link with  cluster objective one, two and four, and SHF 2019 1 standard allocation core elements  one,three, four, five and six, which cover provision of immediate life saving and time critical interventions, focus on communities affected by deteriorating nutrition of GAMgt15% , integration of services across sectors, protection mainstreaming and rapid response  enabling the most urgent scaling up of essential humanitarian activities,\nInterventions will also seek to provide primary ,secondary and tertiary prevention for acute malnutrition, build resilience to cushion against shocks in future and provide a platform to discuss and initiate durable solutions  in conjunction with other clusters and relevant bodies thus preventing shocks and ensuring protection.\nSAF UK has been implementing nutrition (OTP,TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) and health projects in north Hobyo for 2 years, but only covering  Afbarwaqo and surrounding villages, reporting huge impact \nThis proposed project seeks to scale up treatment of MAM beyond our current coverage through additional 3 fixed sites in health facilities and 4 mobile sites to access hard to reach areas. Additionally,the current  supplementary feeding project funded by WFP expires on 30th March 2019. We hope to sustain these services (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) ,avoiding gaps. \nOur proposal is  to provide supplementary feeding interventions (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP)  further integrating with health  project in all proposed sites for cost effective sustainable project",

        "description": ".The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Somaliland and Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Areas of particular concern include Northern Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed, and Galkacayo IDP which are experiencing emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. GAM rates of 10-14.9% are present in Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer. Similarly, the nutrition situation in Galkacayo IDPs is at a critical level and may deteriorate further without humanitarian assistance. According to the nutrition cluster nutrition burden estimate that was released in February 2019, in Galkayo IDPs, the nutrition situation was at a critical level with a GAM rate of 20.2% which is above the emergency threshold of GAMgt15%. Despite the high (estimated to be 61,092 by the health cluster) caseload of children with acute malnutrition in these regions, access to live saving nutrition services remains limited. In order to address these gaps, the proposed project will improve access and provide nutrition services to children aged 0 to 59 months and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) with acute malnutrition through detection and treatment in the targeted nutrition sites. Particular attention will be on the following activities: Training of Community Volunteers in the identification and referral of malnutrition cases to Save the Children   supported   nutrition centers, and mothers trained in mother-led MUAC to enlarge coverage with close monitoring from Save the Children to prevent wrong referrals and ensure quality of the screening and understanding of the community Provision of Outpatient Therapeutic Feeding (OTP) services for children aged 6-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) for Moderately Acute Malnourished children (MAM) and PLW through mobile outreach teams. Referring children aged 0-59 months identified with SAM coupled with medical complication, and SAM infants aged under 6 months with or without medical complications to the nearest stabilization center. The proposed nutrition project is mainly targeting Galkacayo IDPs (27), Awdal (30) and Woqooyi Galbeed (21) and Digaale and Jimaale HFs in Hargeisa IDPs locations, that are most affected by the current drought in Somalia. The project also promotes and supports optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding practices through the screening of breastfeeding difficulties amongst mothers of children under two years of age, provision of one to one counselling for mothers and caretakers with difficulties with regards to Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices and raising awareness of caregivers and relatives on the importance of appropriate IYCF. The project is targeting 59,971 direct beneficiaries, 27,830 will be from the IDPs while 32,141 beneficiaries will be from the Host Communities. In addition, a total of  96,904 beneficiaries will be reached with key IYCF messages in the targeted areas. The proposed project will incorporate learnings from previous projects on how women and girls can participate meaningfully in nutrition interventions.One of the learnings is that mothers in the IDP settlements a lead role in championing for IYCF interventions once they receive sufficient training, this is because they gained a deeper understanding of the importance of breastmilk to children and were willing to breastfeed exclusively if they had a source of livelihood.Another learning is that women can be powerful agents of change when it comes to hygiene promotion once they understand the benefits of good hygiene practices and this has a positive impact on the whole community particularly as women tend to be the sole custodians of household and child rearing chores.",

The accumulated figure reflect 90% of the total burden of the target districts based on 2019 nutrition cluster burden estimates as well as the projected figures for the first half of the year 2020. \n\nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somali Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project.\n\nThe project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the nearest stabilization centers using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will manage 22 fixed OTP sites and 2 stabilization centres (6 OTP fixed sites for Zeila district 9 fixed OTP sites and 1 SC for Berbera district, 6 fixed OTP sites for Hargeisa district 1 fixed OTP and 1 SC for Gabiley district). Efforts will be made to ensure integration of OTP and TSFP sites where possible.  In order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCH facilities. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \n\nIn addition, the project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. In order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.",

This coupled with low levels of community awareness on issues of GBV stigma and other cultural barriers which encourage impunity for breaches in laws and convections. In Kismayo there has been a steady increase in GBV cases since December 2017. This has been attributed to the increasing levels of conflict in Juba land, being one of many active military zones and presence of military frontlines in the identified locations and a high number of IDP camps adjacent to the military camps. Increased forced evictions within the camps have also exposed more women and children to the risk of GBV in the camps thus increasing their vulnerability. \n\nAll the project activities will be carried out to maximize community participation. Regular meetings and capacity building activities at the established women and girl safe space will seek to engage the community in project activities and support the establishment and development of community networks in order to strengthen local mechanisms for prevention and response. By providing support to existing community structures the project will also seek to create women safe spaces to improve protection and to widen support networks. Medical support and psychosocial support with components of material support (dignity kits and solar lantern) coupled with livelihood support will be the backbone of this program.",

        "description": "Approximately 2.9 million people require urgent WASH support in Somalia. In drought affected regions, water scarcity and inadequate quality are leading causes of displacement and conflict, particularly in Puntland and Somaliland, where women and children must often travel over 30 minutes to reach drinking water points. Of the people in need and highly vulnerable, a large percentage are children, women and the elderly, who critically lack access to clean water and are acutely at risk of gender-related violence and high morbidity and mortality due to water-borne disease outbreaks. Many households lack access to adequate sanitation leading to frequent open defecation while safety of people, particularly women and children to access latrines and water points remains a serious concern and a serious risk for exposure to violence\n\nAn estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance in Sanaag IDPs. The climatic situation is exacerbated by conflict in the Sanaag region. According to reports including those from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency (HADMA), the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume. This would create further displacements and insecurity, and be a push factor towards areas where humanitarian actors are responding. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention for IDPs and rural communities in areas affected by drought aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustainable access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points and construction of new boreholes 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation.\n\nACTED will implement these activities in Karasharka, Huluul, Habarshiro, Kalshiikh and Elbuh of Sanaag Region Approximately 25,000 people (4,167 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination and collaboration among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. Specifically, ACTED has coordinated with OXFAM, who will be covering Lasanood, El-AFweyne, Kal sheikh, War-idhaad and Garadheg ) and Ainabo.",

        "description": "According to Humanitarian Dashboard (issued on 22 February 2019) by the Somalia WASH Cluster, several regions of Somaliland and Puntland are experiencing severe shortage of water, due to the over-exploitation of already-limited resources and the breakdown of equipment \u2013 the construction and restoration of water points are subsequently needed. The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Some regions have experienced drought for several seasons. Bari is among the regions worst affected by poor rains, with large moisture deficits and drought conditions.\n\nThe recurrent drought together with nutrition crises and other natural emergencies combined with poor WASH coverage and influx of internally displaced people (IDP) in target regions of Bari including Ishkushuban, Bosasso (IDPs), Qardho (IDPs) highlight the need for Save the Children to continue providing emergency services to vulnerable communities. \n\nTherefore, Save the Children is proposing a 12 months WASH project targeting drought and conflict affected communities in Bari regions targeting Ishkushuban, Bosasso (IDPs), Qardho (IDPs) to provide immediate life-saving WASH services to the most vulnerable members of the community, reaching a total of 48,889 individuals (men: 14,373, women: 14,960, boys: 9,778 and girls: 9,778).\n\nThe proposed project aims to provide lifesaving emergency and sustainable WASH service through drilling of two new strategic boreholes and rehabilitation of three strategic boreholes complete with hybrid power system (solar and diesel power), distribution systems, storage tanks and new water kiosks, and rehabilitation of rain water harvesting berkeds in rural target communities. The project will also improve overall hygiene and sanitation of the target communities through the construction of 150 shared household latrines  affected by the drought.\n\nIn terms of centrality and mainstreaming of protection, the project targets to reduce the risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups while accessing water and sanitation facilities by providing gender segregated facilities and establishing the facilities within 500 meters\u2019 distance of the settlements. The project will also address gender issues by collecting gender and age disaggregated data. Save the Children will analyze this data to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Save the Children will ensure protection during access and utilization of services, to reduce the risk further. \n\nThe project beneficiaries will be selected through a community consultative process with the community leaders and local authorities in order to ensure that only those who meet the specified vulnerability criteria including women and girls, people living with disability, people from minority clans, female headed households,  child-headed households,  survivors of sexual and gender base violence,  and households with a high number of dependents (children, elderly, people with disabilities, pregnant and lactating mothers will be given high priority. Save the Children will maintain and expand synergies across all the programs by ensuring that this project is implemented alongside the other emergency response programs, such as nutrition and health programs, to ensure that benefits arising out of multiple actions to the same target groups are exponentially increased.\n\nThe project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected population. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project included construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion",

The research agenda aims to contribute with scientific knowledge being an foundation for the future design and testing of innovative models of care for the development of midwifery-led care in the Somali context. The expected output is a research agenda in line with the research ideas\u00a0to describe the magnitude of life-threatening, abortion-related complications and women\u2019s access to quality PAC and contraceptives in post-conflict Somaliland.A core group of researchers will be jointly responsible for activities in the collaboration plan. The project, starting in January 2021, will run for two years, during which the following activities are planned: build dialogues with the Somali Health Authorities and key UN health agencies, and engage them through workshops on evidence-based findings related to midwifery care; conduct research-agenda workshops and set research agenda/priorities; write joint publications and proposals; and disseminate the research agenda and proposals. The long-term goal of this project is to contribute scientific evidence to scale up the quality of midwifery care to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity in relation to giving birth in Somaliland.",

During this two-year project the network will collaboratively develop and implement a \u201cTraining of Trainers\u201d (ToT) model, as a strategy to develop institutional and research capacity in EBPH. First social network theory and analysis (SNTA) will be used to assess a Swedish/Somali ToT-course conducted in 2016-2018 by the Somali-Swedish Research Cooperation for Health (SSRCH). The knowledge from this will inform the design of the second ToT course with faculty staff (gender equity) from all involved Somali universities (2021-2022). A concrete outcome will be the establishment of three new research groups that have refined research project plans. Later likely more groups will be formed.Ultimately this will contribute to improved health of the Somali population and achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG\u2019s), especially SDG 3 \u2013 Good health and wellbeing, SDG 4 - Quality education, and SDG 16 \u2013 Peace, justice and strong institutions.",

        "description": "Access to good quality health care is largely problematic in Somalia due to prolonged war and political instability. About 26% of Somalia\u00b4s population live a nomadic life, and this significant group of about 4 million people is believed to have even less access to modern health care and health promotion than the rest of the population.This project aims to build up a network of knowledgeable researchers in Somalia, Kenya and Sweden to, together with representatives of the nomadic population and the Ministry of Health, build up a knowledge bank on nomadic health and health care access. The project will also develop a research application for deeper analysis of 1) central health problems to the nomad population, 2) obstacles to access health care, and 3) design and test interventions to create better access to both emergency care and elective care under the special living conditions of the nomadic population.The University of Gothenburg, KEMRI (Wellcome Trust funded health research program in Kenya) and Benadir University in Somalia are initiating this work but intend to join more partners over the next two years. During the project, three major workshops will be conducted in the relatively safe Hargeisa, Somaliland, and the database will be built by Benadir University.",

The decision is made in accordance with Sida\u2019s contribution management rule, paragraph 3.11.3 and corresponds to the second year of a three year agreement.\n\nIn accordance with Sida\u2019s humanitarian allocation process 2018, Sida proposes to support NRC\u2019s humanitarian programs in the following 21 countries; Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen. \nSida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country, which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However, in the specific case of Palestine, Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component, as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection.  \nThe support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida\u2019s ambition to increase our partner\u2019s predictability, and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.\n\nSida assesses NRC\u2019s country programs as relevant in relation to the Swedish strategy for humanitarian assistance 2017-2020, as well as the humanitarian needs identified in Sida\u2019s humanitarian crises analyses for 2018. \n\nSida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC\u2019s Rapid Response Mechanism, to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises.   \n\nFurthermore, Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced, and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project \u201cStrengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action\u201d, to NRC's internal work on \"Digital Transformation\" and to NRC\u2019s work on humanitarian policy, which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.\n\nSida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms; the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA).  In regard to AIDA, the Consulate General in Jerusalem has the intention to provide support for AIDA within the framework of the cooperation strategy for Palestine. Efficiency gains can be achieved by providing the support through the NRC-Sida humanitarian unit cooperation agreement, and it is thus suggested that Sida/HUM channels this limited development funding, with funding delegated from Palestine Strategy, decision number XXX XXXX\n\nNRC\u2019s target group is mainly comprised of refugees and internally displaced persons but also when relevant, host communities and returnees. NRC is working within its six core competencies (sectors); shelter, livelihoods and food security, education, water and sanitation, camp management and legal advice.\n\nSida and NRC have collaborated since 2005. NRC was granted Sida Strategic Partnership in 2013. NRC is an important partner for Sida as the organisation operates in some of the world's most difficult humanitarian crises. NRC was during 2017 Sidas/Hums largest humanitarian CSO partner, and is expected to remain so in 2018.\n\nSida\u2019s support to NRC comprises a three year agreement for humanitarian activities, for which funding is decided each year based on Sida\u2019s allocation process and NRC\u2019s yearly application. Additional funding is granted through supplementary decisions throughout the year.\nApart from the flexible support offered through the Program Based Approach, NRC may reallocate up to 10 % of funds between RRM-projects in the same country and within individual project budgets. For changes above 10 %, Sida\u2019s prior written approval is needed.\n\nUPDATE 2021\nIncreasingly NRC is developing its programming on the basis of a gender analysis. It is mainstreaming gender across its 6 core competencies of the humanitarian response. The reporting is still to be improved for capturing performances and outcomes regarding the gender perspective in NRC's programmes. NRC is not yet equipped to track the age dimension of the gender perspective in its monitoring framework, but will address this gap as recommended by Sida.\n\nThis partnership agreement was extended to 31 December 2020 for the activity period. In 2020, NRC received 402.7 mkr in total for its humanitarian programmes and projects, including 330.9 mkr for crisis response in 26 settings, 50 mkr for RRMs and 21.8 mkr for capacity development.

NRC is not yet equipped to track the age dimension of the gender perspective in its monitoring framework, but will address this gap as recommended by Sida.\n\nThis partnership agreement was extended to 31 December 2020 for the activity period. In 2020, NRC received 402.7 mkr in total for its humanitarian programmes and projects, including 330.9 mkr for crisis response in 26 settings, 50 mkr for RRMs and 21.8 mkr for capacity development. Bringing the total of this partnership to 1,306,200,000 kr for the 2017-2020 cycle.",

        "title": "SRC Agreement 2017-2019",
        "description": "On January 27, 2017 the Swedish Red Cross (SRC) submitted an application to Sida for the above-mentioned program with an initial budget of 167.5 MSEK for 2017, 16 MSEK for 2018 and 16 MSK for 2019. The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises, and their capacity to recover afterwards, and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.\n\nFunds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments, after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017, following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 4,5 MSEK to13,5 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with, and Sida's approval of, additional applications for these contexts, and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. \n\nThe SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida's support to national societies, the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon, DR Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. \n\nThe SRC\u2019s strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC \u2013 is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC\u2019s new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does, however, put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation\u2019s application 2017-2019. Several programmes with a long-term development focus have been removed in the application for funding from Sida, and new initiatives with a sharper humanitarian focus have been included, such as Yemen and Cameroon (programme targeting CAR refugees). It will be important to follow up on this positive direction towards a strengthened humanitarian relevance to the Sida-funded projects to ensure its continuation.\n\nSupport planned for 2017 includes long-term programs in various fields such as health, disaster prevention, resilience, sanitation, organizational development, volunteer development and planning, monitoring, evaluation and results (PMER). The support also includes regional support to the IFRC\u2019s different cluster- and regional offices in Africa, Asia and MENA. Thematic- and capacity enhancement support will in 2017 focus on disaster reduction, volunteering in conflict and disaster, water and sanitation, health, and gender and diversity. Through support in the form of Sida's Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), the SRC will also be able to respond to rapid onsets of disasters. \n\nThe program proposal for 2017 includes:\nWEST- AND CENTRAL AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 1,3 MSEK\nCAMEROON: 2 MSEK\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nEAST- AND SOUTH AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 2,1 MSEK\nEAST AFRICA CLUSTER (Nairobi): 2,5 MSEK\nSOMALIA: 4 MSEK \nSOUTH SUDAN: 13,5 MSEK\nSUDAN: 4 MSEK\nASIA PACIFIC REGIONAL SUPPORT: 5,8 MSEK\nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nBANGLADESH: 6 MSEK\nDPRK: 4,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \nMENA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 4,3 MSEK\nIRAQ: 7 MSEK\nPALESTINE: 3 MSEK\nSYRIA INCLUDING Lebanon och Jordan: 30 MSEK \nYEMEN: 4,5 MSEK \nUKRAINE: 5 MSEK\nCAPACITY- OCH METHOD SUPPORT: 7,9 MSEK \nRRM-SUPPORT: 40 MSEK\nSUPPORT FOR THE DREF: 500 000 SEK \nSPECIAL INTERVENTIONS/ICRC DELEGATES: 3,6 MSEK\n\nThe program proposal for 2018 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nThe program proposal for 2019 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nOut of Sida's initial support for 2017 totalling 167.5 MSEK, 61.4 % (103.5 MSEK) will be channelled to the IFRC and 2.6 % (4,5 MSEK) to the ICRC. Approximately 5.5 % (9.3 MSEK) consists of projects that the SRC supports in consortia and where funds are allocated through partner NS such as British, Australian and Danish Red Cross. Approximately 8.9 % (15.0 MSEK) will be channelled directly to NS (e.g., DRC and Palestinian RC, further contributions go to a number of NS for the management of SRC delegates in-country costs). Approximately 21.6 % (36.3 MSEK) out of the total budget goes directly to the SRC, of which 14.8 % (25 MSEK) for staff costs (technical delegates and program officers) and 7 % to operational support costs (11.3 MSEK).",

        "description": "The proposed programme by the Swedish Mission Council (SMC) is humanitarian and aims at meeting the humanitarian needs of affected populations in the short- and medium-term by providing emergency humanitarian support such as clean water and sanitation. In this appraisal, Sida makes the assessment that the proposed programme is relevant in relation to the Strategy for Sweden\u00b4s Humanitarian Assistance provided through Sida 2017 - 2020, and that a three-year agreement on strategic partnership should be entered into between Sida and SMC for the period 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2020.\n\nIn its proposal for 2017, SMC has applied for a total amount of 46,5 million SEK which includes 1) work in six countries (35,5 million SEK); 2) interventions through the Rapid Response Mechanism (10 million SEK); and 3) capacity development support (1 million SEK). During 2017 SMC proposes to work with four member organizations which are ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency), IAS (International Aid Services), CCS (Christian Council of Sweden) and PMU (Pingsmissionens utvecklingssamarbete). \n\nSMC, founded in 1912, is an ecumenical membership-based organization with 35 member organizations who are active in 46 countries. The organization is engaged in both development work and humanitarian assistance and became a framework organization for Sida/CIVSAM already in 1980, while the strategic partnership with Sida in terms of humanitarian assistance was initiated as late as 2014. The 35 members are Swedish churches and Christian organizations with long histories of international work - the role of SMC is generally to support, facilitate and coordinate these partner organizations and their local partners\u00b4 work.",

LPI applying for support from Sida / Embassy in Nairobi for the program of which Sweden is funding 44% of the total budget 80 356 743 SEK. LPI has applied for EU funding through their call for proposals that are taking place during March 2017. LPI is applying for funding together with the Somali partner Somali Peace Line (SPL). LPI is currently investigating other potential donors. LPI has adjusted the current planning for 2017 to fit with the proposed support from Sida (and EU funds for CRM Phase II). The program is currently underfunded by 26%.\n\nThe head of the development cooperation with Somalia hereby makes a decision to divert from the requirement of bringing the appraisal for assessment in the Embassy common quality assurance committee QAC. Although the proposed budget exceeds the amount of 20MSEK that requires the intervention to be assessed in the embassy Committee, it is hereby decided to divert from this requirement based on Sida's good record of cooperation with LPI from the support of its Somalia program as well as global programs, as well as the time-pressured situation where funding to address the drought situation and famine should be given priority. The proposal, has however been taken up for discussion in the Somali Section's internal committee where it was assessed as highly relevant and with the recommendation that a decision to be taken on support.\n\nDue to the fact that Sweden's strategy for development cooperation with Somalia expires after 2017 and a new strategy is planned for the periode between 2018-2021, Sida is restricted to commit to funding for years beyond 2019. Consequently, Sida and LPI will enter into agreement for the period 2017-2019 with the option to extend the agreement with addition of funds for the year 2020.\n\nThe proposal also includes an integrated component of emergency aid to the ongoing and severe drought that hit the country in 2016 and continues to pose a threat in 2017. According to LPI, this response, with activities such as the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, job creation efforts, health nutritional packages, cholera prevention, hygiene training, food ration and the distribution of food parcels, knowledge about basic health program and services, strengthening social cohesion etc., constitutes a prerequisite to conduct the comprehensive peace building work in the areas that are the hardest hit by the drought. This initiative will run for three months and be reported separately (narrative, financial) in the first half-year reporting. LPI will forward 5,4MSEK to ZamZam Foundation (ZZF) for implementation of their drought response between April to June 2017.

        "description": "The Somalia Stability Fund has developed a new strategy for a phase II of its initiative to build up the conditions for a stable Somalia with the potential to develop the society by political, social and financial means. \n\nSSF phase II is developed as a flexible program which is shaped so as to adapt its approach by new learning to a dynamic context. Phase II will implement a Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation Model (PDIA) which identifies the root causes to the instability in Somalia and solutions are developed on a case-by-case basis. The aim of this model is to generate a sequence of iterative solutions, in other Words, investments and adaptations will be based on previous lessons learned and experiences so as to enable a proper response.\n\nThe Theory of Change (ToC) for phase II claims that:\nIf the stability in newly recovered areas in Somalia is improved by a strengthened relation between societies, an increased trust for the government, and a reduced risk for revolt among the population -If governmental institutions gain increased legitimacy - through the participation of women and marginalized Groups, representation and ability to establish a broad normative framework over their jurisdiction - and an increased capacity - characterized by increased effectiveness, profitability, and the state's accountability of core functions - and; If the communities' vulnerabilities to conflict reduce through the implementation of grievance redress mechanisms, and support to actors for Peace; Then, the stability in Somalia will improve since the state institutions are more inclusive, more legitimate, and better able to perform its tasks, the vulnerabilities to conflict have reduced and the possibilities for social and economic development are available for the larger population.\n\nThe Theory of Change (ToC) is based on Three pillars:\n1. Stabilization (The stability in the newly recovered areas is strengthened, which is characterized by improved relations between Clans, improved trust and confidence in the government, and a reduced capacity for revolt);\n2. Statebuilding (State institutions have an increased legitimacy which is characterized by inclusiveness, representation and participation; and which has an increased capacity which is characterized by the ability to establish a broad normative framework over their jurisdictions, and an increased effectiveness of state core functions);\n3. Conflict prevention and administration (The communities' vulnerabilities to conflicts have reduced through grievance redress mechanisms as well as support to actors for peace).\nThe overall impact of phase II is to improve the stability in Somalia through more inclusive, more legitimate and better capable state institutions to perform their tasks, and the vulnerabilities to conflicts have reduced and the possibilities for social and economic development are available for the wider population. The Somalia Stability Fund supports activities in newly recovered areas through trustbuilding for the government as well as improved social cohesion as part of the statebuilding process.\nThe fund is in a good position to support capacity building and strenghten the legitimacy within administrations. With its ability to connect the political engagement with the Project financial support, SSF becomes specifically relevant to support inclusive settlements through support to:\n- marginalized areas;\n- job Creation;\n- rehabilitation of infrastructure;\n- integration of state administrations.\n\nThe niche of SSF is to invest in long-term capacity building so as to develop the core functions within the state. Particularly, the SSF is able to build administrative Control and provide infrastructural services (especially at the local level); and with a small grant support to a legal monopoly of the use of violence (especially through collaboration with the UN and bilateral programs to adapt the police to underinvested areas); rule of law; and market Creations, especially protection of land rights; and the management of public finances.\n\nPhase II of SSF aims to prevent and resolve conflicts through conflict and gender sensitive approach. The fund has particular abilities to support states by acting as mediator. It also has the possibility to bring added value to the UN and bilateral programs which support the judicial system through a discussion-based approach, as well as the possibility to develop institution-building which contributes as a mediator in land disputes or women's access to legal support. The support to youth employment is also a comparative advantage for the fund due to its ability to deliver innovative partnerships within the private sector.\n\nThe Fund which is donor-driven will be supported by Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, the EU, Germany, and DFID. Sweden is through this decision allocating a total of SEK 40,000,000 between 2018-2020.",

        "description": "This is an intervention for the continued support of MSEK 475 to the \"UN Multi-Partnership Trust Fund\" (MPTF) for Somalia in 2018-2019. In Decision 2016-002435, dated 30 June 2015, Sida decided to support MPTF 2015-2017 with an amount of 140 MSEK. Following the decision 52/16 from November 2016, an additional 33 MSEK was added and an additional  55 MSEK through decision 14/17, dated April 24, 2017 and finally 10 MSEK was added in Dwecember 2017 through decision 58/2017. Sida assess that the MPTF and the joint programs that Sweden contributes to delivers results despite some challenges that comes with implementation of programmes in a difficult context.\n\nSomalia is one of the poorest countries in the world and is characterized by inequality. Recurrent humanitarian crises and armed conflicts pose challenging to the development of the country. Furthermore, Somalia is affected by climate change and recurring periods of drought. 2.3 million people have insecure food supplies and there are over one million internally displaced persons. Of a population of about 12 million, over 70% are poor and more than 40% live in extreme poverty. One of seven children dies before their first birthday; one of eighteen women die in childbirth; and only one in three persons have access to safe drinking water. Over 70% of Somalia's population is under thirty years and lack employment opportunities which leave many of them with few prospects for the future. Women are structurally discriminated and gender based violence is widespread. Somalia has the highest incidence of female genital mutilation in the world. Women also lack access to justice that can protect their interests. The lack of a formal and effective legal justice system in most parts of the country has led to extensive impunity. In 2017, Somalia was ranked as the most corrupt country in the world according to Transparency International.\n\nHowever, a relatively peaceful political process for state building has begun. The increasing international support in recent years has contributed to progress in many areas. The implementation of the indirect parliamentary election held in the fall of 2016 with increased political representation of women in addition to the presidential elections in February 2017 followed by a peaceful change of power are particularly positive signs.\n\nThe MPTF was established in 2015 with Sweden as one of the first donors. The fund currently manages a total of USD 200 million. The two biggest donors are the EU followed by UK. So far, Sweden has contributed with 238 MSEK during the period and is thereby the third largest donor to the fund. During the period 2015-2017, Sweden has supported the central political processes (elections, constitution, parliament and the new federal state formation), the development of the judiciary, job creation for young people, and public administration. Furthermore, Sweden has provided support to the UN's core functions to enable effective implementation in a challenging context like Somalia. In addition, pilot support for the fund's so-called \"national window\", to use Somalia\u2019s own country systems have been successfully supported to a prison rehabilitation facility, supplementing the above-mentioned legal aid program. Despite challenges on an overall level, it is Sida's assessment that these programs together deliver results.\n\nMoreover, Sida assess that the MPTF is now fully established and that the programmes that are funded are implemented satisfactory. The international community has made significant commitments. Somalia has developed a National Development Plan (NDP) for Somalia 2017-2019. In addition, a Security Pact was adopted at the Somalia Conference held in May 2017 in London. The Security Pact sets out the roadmap for a Comprehensive Approach to Security, CAS. Hence, the UN has developed its own strategic plan (UNSF) for Somalia that reflects both the NDP and CAS. The MPTF is the main funding mechanism for UN support the implementation on the UNSF.\n\nSida assess that the MPTF continues to be relevant and appropriate mechanism to deliver support. Based on Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Somalia and the new Strategy to come, Sida proposes that the continued support to the MPTF shall be earmarked for the following thematic areas and for the programs decided in the framework of these:\n1. Including policies, governance and federal state building, as well as reconciliation\n2. Human rights, women, peace and security\n3. Economic recovery and resilience\n4. Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights\n\nWithin the area of Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights, 140 MSEK will be earmarked to UNFPA\u2019s country programme for Somalia 2018-2020. For more information on the assessment of UNFPA as a strategic partner to Sida in Somalia, pleas se decision 28/2017, dated 2017-06-22. In addition, 60 MSEK shall be earmarked for the so-called \"Enablers Program\", which includes support for the UN Risk Management Unit, the UN department for Security, and the Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO), which is considered to be crucial for implementation of all development efforts in Somalia. \n\nHowever, the MPTF is not only a financing mechanism but also constitutes a platform for donor coordination in a broader sense since it includes the major actors such as the EU, UK, US, NO, DE, and DK. At the same time, there is a trend that the EU and the UK are launching new bilateral programs in certain areas, while other donors such as DE will expand their support in favor of the MPTF. The MPTF is an important and a key instrument for cooperation between the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia to realize the overall development goals of sustainable peace and development in Somalia.\n\nThe MPTF will harmonize and align the significant resources that are channeled through the UN in Somalia and as such it is foreseen to a more effective international support for Somalia. If the international community, the FSG and other stakeholders cooperate to reduce the risks, it is Sida's assessment that objectives will be reached to a reasonable extent despite the complex context and the many challenges it entails.\n\nThe draft agreement follows that between the UNDP and Sida agreed template for the current form of cooperation. The new standard Standard Administrative Arrangement, SAA will regulate Sweden's contribution to the MPTF. The SAA will be signed by Sida and UNDP as the administrative agent. A Terms of Reference for the MPTF as well as a Memorandum of Understanding between all implementation UN partners are attached. Sida\u2019s conditions in the contribution management rule are thereby fulfilled. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement has been signed between the Government of Somalia and UNDP as an administrative agent.",

Somalia suffers from the consequences of severe economic infrastructure destruction, high unemployment rates, a lack of technical skills and the erosion of the livelihood asset base of the Somali people. Somalia\u2019s economy urgently requires technology and skills transfer as well as a substantial increase in access to technical and vocational training opportunities. In addition, there remains an urgent need to address gender inequality in terms of access to employment and livelihoods. This project aims to contribute to these ends through the creation of short and long-term jobs through improving access to technical vocational skills for under skilled and underemployed youth in particular women.; and strengthening the quality of, and access to, vocational training opportunities. The project focuses on the creation of activity \u2018packages\u2019 that are interconnected and designed to enhance the overall effectiveness and impact of the project. The project has a strong focus on local level ownership of project activities \u2013 both at the governmental and community level \u2013 and the building of local capacities to ensure the sustainability of project initiatives.",

        "description": "This is an intervention for the continued support of MSEK 475 to the \"UN Multi-Partnership Trust Fund\" (MPTF) for Somalia in 2018-2019. In Decision 2016-002435, dated 30 June 2015, Sida decided to support MPTF 2015-2017 with an amount of 140 MSEK. Following the decision 52/16 from November 2016, an additional 33 MSEK was added and an additional  55 MSEK through decision 14/17, dated April 24, 2017 and finally 10 MSEK was added in Dwecember 2017 through decision 58/2017. Sida assess that the MPTF and the joint programs that Sweden contributes to delivers results despite some challenges that comes with implementation of programmes in a difficult context.\n\nSomalia is one of the poorest countries in the world and is characterized by inequality. Recurrent humanitarian crises and armed conflicts pose challenging to the development of the country. Furthermore, Somalia is affected by climate change and recurring periods of drought. 2.3 million people have insecure food supplies and there are over one million internally displaced persons. Of a population of about 12 million, over 70% are poor and more than 40% live in extreme poverty. One of seven children dies before their first birthday; one of eighteen women die in childbirth; and only one in three persons have access to safe drinking water. Over 70% of Somalia's population is under thirty years and lack employment opportunities which leave many of them with few prospects for the future. Women are structurally discriminated and gender based violence is widespread. Somalia has the highest incidence of female genital mutilation in the world. Women also lack access to justice that can protect their interests. The lack of a formal and effective legal justice system in most parts of the country has led to extensive impunity. In 2017, Somalia was ranked as the most corrupt country in the world according to Transparency International.\n\nHowever, a relatively peaceful political process for state building has begun. The increasing international support in recent years has contributed to progress in many areas. The implementation of the indirect parliamentary election held in the fall of 2016 with increased political representation of women in addition to the presidential elections in February 2017 followed by a peaceful change of power are particularly positive signs.\n\nThe MPTF was established in 2015 with Sweden as one of the first donors. The fund currently manages a total of USD 200 million. The two biggest donors are the EU followed by UK. So far, Sweden has contributed with 238 MSEK during the period and is thereby the third largest donor to the fund. During the period 2015-2017, Sweden has supported the central political processes (elections, constitution, parliament and the new federal state formation), the development of the judiciary, job creation for young people, and public administration. Furthermore, Sweden has provided support to the UN's core functions to enable effective implementation in a challenging context like Somalia. In addition, pilot support for the fund's so-called \"national window\", to use Somalia\u2019s own country systems have been successfully supported to a prison rehabilitation facility, supplementing the above-mentioned legal aid program. Despite challenges on an overall level, it is Sida's assessment that these programs together deliver results.\n\nMoreover, Sida assess that the MPTF is now fully established and that the programmes that are funded are implemented satisfactory. The international community has made significant commitments. Somalia has developed a National Development Plan (NDP) for Somalia 2017-2019. In addition, a Security Pact was adopted at the Somalia Conference held in May 2017 in London. The Security Pact sets out the roadmap for a Comprehensive Approach to Security, CAS. Hence, the UN has developed its own strategic plan (UNSF) for Somalia that reflects both the NDP and CAS. The MPTF is the main funding mechanism for UN support the implementation on the UNSF.\n\nSida assess that the MPTF continues to be relevant and appropriate mechanism to deliver support. Based on Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Somalia and the new Strategy to come, Sida proposes that the continued support to the MPTF shall be earmarked for the following thematic areas and for the programs decided in the framework of these:\n1. Including policies, governance and federal state building, as well as reconciliation\n2. Human rights, women, peace and security\n3. Economic recovery and resilience\n4. Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights\n\nWithin the area of Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights, 140 MSEK will be earmarked to UNFPA\u2019s country programme for Somalia 2018-2020. For more information on the assessment of UNFPA as a strategic partner to Sida in Somalia, pleas se decision 28/2017, dated 2017-06-22. In addition, 60 MSEK shall be earmarked for the so-called \"Enablers Program\", which includes support for the UN Risk Management Unit, the UN department for Security, and the Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO), which is considered to be crucial for implementation of all development efforts in Somalia. \n\nHowever, the MPTF is not only a financing mechanism but also constitutes a platform for donor coordination in a broader sense since it includes the major actors such as the EU, UK, US, NO, DE, and DK. At the same time, there is a trend that the EU and the UK are launching new bilateral programs in certain areas, while other donors such as DE will expand their support in favor of the MPTF. The MPTF is an important and a key instrument for cooperation between the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia to realize the overall development goals of sustainable peace and development in Somalia.\n\nThe MPTF will harmonize and align the significant resources that are channeled through the UN in Somalia and as such it is foreseen to a more effective international support for Somalia. If the international community, the FSG and other stakeholders cooperate to reduce the risks, it is Sida's assessment that objectives will be reached to a reasonable extent despite the complex context and the many challenges it entails.\n\nThe draft agreement follows that between the UNDP and Sida agreed template for the current form of cooperation. The new standard Standard Administrative Arrangement, SAA will regulate Sweden's contribution to the MPTF. The SAA will be signed by Sida and UNDP as the administrative agent. A Terms of Reference for the MPTF as well as a Memorandum of Understanding between all implementation UN partners are attached. Sida\u2019s conditions in the contribution management rule are thereby fulfilled. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement has been signed between the Government of Somalia and UNDP as an administrative agent.",

        "description": "Somalia is ranked bottom in global indicators on gender inequality, maternal, reproductive and neonatal health and survival. One in 22 women dies every year due to pregnancy or childbirth related complications.  Neonatal deaths in children (i.e. deaths in children during the first 28 days of life) occur at a higher rate in Somalia than in any other country in the world (UNICEF 2016). Fertility in women is high with an average of 6.6 children per woman. At the same time, the incidence of gender-related violence among women including child marriages and forced marriage (more than 45 percent of girls under 18 years and one in 10 girls under 15 have been forced to marriages) and female gender mutilation (about 98 percent) are still high in the country. Women and girls have limited ability, if at all, to decide over their own bodies such when and whom to marry and when and how many children she wants and desires. Family planning still remains a difficult subject to openly discuss. Women seek these services in secrecy. \n\nUNFPA has after engagement by the embassy submitted a request to Sida for continued support to UNFPA:s country program document for the period 2011-2015, which has been formally extended until 31 December 2017. Focus for the CPD is on four key areas: 1) reproductive, maternal and neonatal health; 2) gender equality, with a special attention on SGBV; FGM and early marriage; 3) population data and statistiks; and 4) youh. Sweden has given support to UNFPA since 2014 within the framework of the previous joint health and nutrition program (JHNP) which ended in April 2017. Within the framework of JHNP, UNFPA has contributed to several important results, including: 1) training, quality assurance and registration of midwives; 2) maternal health services for pregnant women including increased access to modern contraception; 3) advocacy and community engagement in preventing female genital mutilation, child marriages, and violence against women; and 4) legal support towards for FGM and SGBV bill, both approved and adopted in Puntland region of Somalia while in federal government and in Somaliland the bills are awaiting parliament approval. UNFPA's work has a clear ownership of the Somali government and its federal administrations.\n\nIn addition to Sweden, UNFPA recieved new funding during 2017 from Finland, UK, Japan and Italy. Swedens longer-term support to UNFPA Somalia operations will be aligned with the new UNFPA Country Program Document (CPD) for the period 2018-2020, which is expected to be endorsed on the September board meeting in New York, and which will be part of the Swedens support to the UN Multi Partner Trust Fund Phase II which will be assessed during late autumn 2017.",

        "title": "UNICEF Enhancing the protection of children in armed conflict",
        "description": "Every year, tens of thousands of boys and girls are recruited and used by armed groups worldwide. This is happening despite international agreements to end the use of children under the age of 18 in armed conflicts. The issue was highlighted further through Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 in Agenda 2030 that among other things calls for immediate and effective measures to eradicate the worst forms of child labour, including the recruitment and use of childsoldiers. Despite these commitments, children are used in armed conflicts and countries are experiencing enormous challenges in convincing fighting parties to release children and find ways to reintegrate them into society. \n\nChildren who are released have often gone through traumatic experiences and are sometimes imprisoned or stigmatized by communities who see them as a continued threat. UNICEF works closely with its partners to avoid that children are separated from their families and has, through advocacy with armed groups since 2016, assisted with the release of 22 500 children out of which 11 300 children have been reintegrated with their communities. Among the activities are psychosocial support, support to continued education and activities that increase social cohesion and peacebuilding. \n\nIn situations of protracted conflicts, there are often gaps in financing when emergency aid through humanitarian assistance often needs to focus on more urgent needs and where development cooperation yet has not been established. Support to the release and reintegration of children formerly associated with armed groups needs extended funding to be sustainable. In order to build resilience against re-recruitment and strengthen young boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 engagement and participation in peacebuilding in support of social cohesion, the gaps that occur between humanitarian and development aid need to be bridged. UNICEF works to bridge this gap through \u2018The New Way of Working\u2019 and has identified the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Somalia as three countries where more than 50% of the children that have been released from armed groups yet are to receive support to socio-economic reintegration programmes. Sida\u2019s support therefore aims at bridging this gap within the three country contexts in order to assist UNICEF in its work to release and reintegrate children in a more sustainable way. \nThe long-term goal of the intervention is \u201cTo contribute to ending and preventing grave violations committed against children in armed conflict, including the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups, and to supporting the release and reintegration of these children\u201d.",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis assessment forms the basis for a new three-year agreement between Oxfam GB and Sida to support Oxfam GB\u2019s humanitarian programme from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2021, where additional contributions will be added to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and Sida needs assessments.\n\nIn 2018, more than 135 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance globally to a cost of 22.5 billion dollar, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Sweden's humanitarian assistance is needs-based and Sida each year undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all humanitarian crises are analysed, and where the partners most relevant to respond to the identified needs are selected.\n\nA number of the identified global needs for 2018 are found in protracted and forgotten crises, and Sida believes that Oxfam GB is well positioned to respond to these needs as the organization is also working with long-term development cooperation. Moreover, Oxfam GB has extensive knowledge of the local context in all proposed projects and capacity building of local actors is central to Oxfam GB's humanitarian work. In 2018-2021, it is therefore suggested that Oxfam GB receives support for emergency lifesaving activities as well as funding for longer-term activities aimed at strengthening societies\u2019 resilience to crises and disasters.\n\nOxfam GB has in previous collaborations with Sida demonstrated that the organisation is a professional and efficient humanitarian actor, most recently in the agreements during 2011-2013 and 2014-2017. In 2016 alone, Oxfam GB managed to reach 1.2 million people with humanitarian support in the sector of WASH, 94,000 people with food security and livelihood interventions and 106,000 people with protection assistance in conflict-affected settings. In line with this, Sida believes that Oxfam GB has an added value when it comes to activities of food security and livelihoods, WASH and protection. Moreover, Sida assesses that Oxfam GB's planned projects are relevant in accordance with Sida\u2019s Humanitarian Crisis Analyses (HCA) that form the basis for the allocation of a majority of the humanitarian funds for 2018 and contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Strategy for Sweden\u2019s humanitarian aid provided through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) 2017\u20132020. Sida therefore proposes to support Oxfam GB's humanitarian projects to a cost of 104 MSEK.\n\nIn 2018-2021, Oxfam GB plans to reach over 280,000 people in Algeria, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq and Chad. The contribution will consist of four components focusing on emergency life-saving activities; multi-year resilience building projects; the possibility to respond to sudden onset or deteriorating humanitarian emergencies during the year through the Rapid Response Mechanism; as well as support to method development of cash-based programming.\n\nTwo 1-year projects are proposed to be funded with a total of 5 MSEK with the following breakdown:\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo: 1 MSEK\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Oxfam will provide support to an INGO forum with 100 NGO members with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of humanitarian interventions through improved coordination.\n\nIraq: 4 MSEK\nIn Iraq, Sida will support a project focusing on first line emergency response. The projects will target 9,600 people and include activities of food distribution as well as distribution of non-food items and hygiene materials.\n\nFive 3-year projects are proposed to be funded with a total of 28 MSEK for 2018, 19 MSEK for 2019 and 16 MSEK for 2019 with the following breakdown:\n\nAlgeria: 15 MSEK (5+5+5 MSEK)\nIn Algeria, 126 600 Sahrawi refugees will be supported in a project focusing on improving dietary diversity and strengthening of small-scale agriculture with the aim of increasing food security in the refugee camps. To reach the planned goals of the project, Oxfam will distribute fresh vegetables and flour, conduct trainings and awareness sessions on agricultural production and introduce drought-resistant crops.\n\nCentral African Republic: 18 MSEK (10+5+3 MSEK)\nIn the Central African Republic, Oxfam will target 17,500 people with food, protection and WASH activities, together with resilience building through recovery of productive assets and strengthening of communities\u2019 conflict management capabilities. The proposed activities include distribution of agricultural kits, awareness-raising on food diversification, protection and gender themes as well as strengthening of community protection committees.\n\nChad: 18 MSEK (10+5+3 MSEK)\nThe project in Chad will target 49,087 people in a project aiming to improve access to basic social services, protection, and the restoration of livelihoods. The project activities include borehole drilling, trainings of water management committees, latrine construction and hygiene promotion. The project will also highlight issues of protection and gender-based violence through awareness raising, establishment of protection committees, mapping of care services for victims of abuses and violations and awareness raising sessions on protection issues.\n\nIraq: 12 MSEK (3+4+5 MSEK)\nIn Iraq, Sida will support a project focusing on capacity building of local humanitarian leadership with the aim of strengthening the local humanitarian response capacity. The projects will target local humanitarian actors as well as a number of local NGOs.\n\nMoreover, it is further proposed that Sida contributes with 25 million within the Rapid Response Mechanism, RRM, to enable Oxfam GB to respond to sudden onset or deteriorating humanitarian emergencies throughout the year.\n\nMoreover, in addition to funding provided directly to Oxfam GB, Sida will also support the Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP) in a 3-year intervention with a total funding of 9 MSEK (4+3+2 MSEK). CaLP is a network based on learning, knowledge sharing, networking and coordination around the appropriate and timely use of cash transfer programming (CTP) in humanitarian response. CaLP does not deliver cash transfer programmes directly. The vision of CaLP is that humanitarian assistance creates the greatest value, choice and dignity for people in crisis. CaLP has six Global Objectives: 1. Ensure sufficient funding is available for cash transfer programming. 2. Ensure cash is systematically considered as an option. 3. Build sufficient capacity for cash transfer programming. 4. Strengthen coordination. 5. Ensure the effectiveness and quality of cash transfer programming. 6. Build evidence and invest in innovation. The work of CaLP\u2019s secretariat is summarised in four strategic objectives: 1. Provide specialist capacity building services and advice. 2. Make the evidence base easily accessible, improve it and apply it through standards and tools. 3. Provide specialist support to coordinating bodies. 4. Ensure influential policy processes promote CTP and the six Global Objectives.\n\nThe support to CaLP is in line with Strategy for Sweden\u2019s humanitarian aid provided through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) 2017\u20132020 as well as Sida\u2019s commitments to cash in the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) and in the Grand Bargain. Sida assesses that CaLP is a key organisation to work with to reach the aims of the humanitarian strategy and that the collaboration with CaLP will benefit not only Sida but the humanitarian sector as a whole. As CaLP is not a legal body and is hosted by the Humanitarian Department of Oxfam House, it is decided to include the support to CaLP in this appraisal and in the agreement between Oxfam GB and Sida.\n\nFinally, in addition to the funding of Oxfam GB's humanitarian projects, Oxfam GB will also receive 2 MSEK in programme management costs. This is further elaborated in the budget section in this appraisal.\n\nFor a detailed overview of the project allocations, see Annex VII of the agreement (Budget summary).",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level.

As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

        "title": "Somalia Credit Guarantee Scheme (SCGS)",
        "description": "The intervention targets several development problems in Somalia. The financial sector in Somalia is underdeveloped. Banks practice an exclusive approach towards lending that only occurs to the few that can provide collateral. Financing costs are high and allow only short-term financing. The majority of the population, and especially women and young people, are excluded from the financial sector due to lack of collateral and perceived risk level. This in turn has a major negative impact on micro, small and medium sized businesses, MSMEs and its conditions for employment and creating jobs. This initiative is expected to open up for access to finance for MSMEs, thereby contributing to job creation, especially for women and youth, in Somalia.\nSeveral on-going programs, including the World Bank's Somalia Core Economic Institutions and Opportunities Program (SCORE), supported by Sweden among several other donors, work to address issues related to the legal framework and legal review, as well as formalization of the financial sector, but no intervention is targeting the problem of access to finance and cost of credit. The biggest casualties of this are MSME's which are widely recognized as key drivers of new job creation and overall economic growth. Therefore, the objective of this intervention is to reduce poverty in Somalia through enterprise growth and employment creation. MSME, especially with focus on women and young people, will be able to benefit from formal banking system and the Somali financial will be able to benefit from more long-term clients, which in turn will provide much needed growth capital for expansion, employment and contribute to resilience. \nIn the long run, it is expected to contribute to a change in Financial Institutions' lending attitudes to include a broader segment of clients and recognize on their part that this makes good business sense. For MSMEs this is expected to provide resources for sustainable job creation as they benefit from what can become a long-term relationship with the financial institutions.\nThe intervention intends to provide credit guarantees in order to incentivize lending to merit worthy MSME applicants in any sector that lack sufficient collateral. To achieve this, Sida will provide a guarantee to One Earth Future Foundation (OEF), which will be Sida's agreement partner. OEF is an American NGO with projects in Somalia, among other fragile countries. The work in Somalia is handled under a project called Shuraako. Shuraako work to facilitate investments in promising Somali-based businesses. OEF will in turn sign separate agreements with the three (out of currently six) Somali financial institutions: Dahabshil Bank, Premier Bank and International Bank of Somalia, but additional financial institutions may be added during the guarantee period.\nThe three banks are the ones who give loans to the target group by utilizing the risk sharing set-up of the guarantee. The guarantee to OEF means that the banks\u00b4 risk is reduced for up to 70% in case the loan is not repaid while the bank takes the remaining 30%. OEF estimates that approximately 260 loans will be guaranteed and over 2000 jobs will be created during the five-year project period.\nThis 5 million USD Guarantee is complemented by a grant to OEF for Technical Assistance (TA) that will be provided to the banks and MSMEs, including OEFs operational costs for managing and following up the guarantee instrument. The grant component is considered essential for achieving the goal of this intervention. The Guarantee instrument and Grant component will be handled in two separate agreements where the Grant Agreement is handled by the Embassy.",

The project will strengthen the resilience of riverine and agro pastoralist by building their capacities to absorb and adapt to shocks and stressors in the food system.

Further, the project will support development of the target value chains to improve effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nThe outcome of the proposed project will be to enhance food and nutrition security and incomes therefore improving resilience of communities to threats and crises. Within the rain-fed and riverine areas, the project will support 20 farming cooperatives, of up to 250 smallholder farmers in each group. These cooperatives will provide farmers the opportunity to move beyond subsistence farming with access to high quality inputs, extension services and links to high value market actors. By aggregating their supply and production needs, these farmer groups can achieve the economies of scale needed to access more profitable markets.

        "description": "This joint intervention between WFP and FAO together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI) and the farmers\u2019 cooperatives will  consolidates and complements FAO and WFP past and ongoing interventions for enhancing livelihoods, resilience and economic development. The project will combine capacity building support to smallholders and private sector organizations to enhance rural services based on public-private collaboration, creating better job opportunities, income, and livelihoods for smallholder farmers in selected agricultural crop value chains. \n\nThis project complements the ongoing work by FAO and WFP with cooperatives in rain-fed and riverine farming in Somalia that is addressing crop production, productivity, quality and market access issues. The project will strengthen the resilience of riverine and agro pastoralist by building their capacities to absorb and adapt to shocks and stressors in the food system. The project will also have a transformative effect on the resilience of food systems by supporting the development of sustainable local institutions to manage food production, post-harvest management and marketing. Further, the project will support development of the target value chains to improve effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nThe outcome of the proposed project will be to enhance food and nutrition security and incomes therefore improving resilience of communities to threats and crises. Within the rain-fed and riverine areas, the project will support 20 farming cooperatives, of up to 250 smallholder farmers in each group. These cooperatives will provide farmers the opportunity to move beyond subsistence farming with access to high quality inputs, extension services and links to high value market actors. By aggregating their supply and production needs, these farmer groups can achieve the economies of scale needed to access more profitable markets. When properly equipped and managed, farmer groups act as shock absorbers in times of crisis \u2013 through savings schemes, pooled resources and other support mechanisms.",

        "description": "Somalia is one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with nearly 7 out of 10 people living in poverty. The poorest are widespread particularly among populations living in e.g. rural areas and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements. The humanitarian crisis in Somalia has for decades been one of the most complex and protracted emergencies in the world with climate-induced hazards (recurrent droughts and flashfloods), locust plagues and ongoing conflict. The country continues to be fragile with a population which frequently faces the predicament of too frequent shocks that do not allow ample time for recovery from local coping mechanisms.  \n\nClimatic changes which are likely to increase in both frequency and severity strongly impact on-going conflict dynamics, which in turn, significantly affect the livelihood of already vulnerable communities, especially through the effects on migration, forced displacement and loss of income generating resources/assets. The absence of livelihood options and the increase in poverty contribute to grievances, conflicts and susceptibility to shocks. The accumulation of household debt is a key vulnerability for those Somalis whose livelihoods are negatively impacted by repeated extreme patterns of climate shocks and intermittent conflict. Grievances that are linked to group affiliation are particularly serious risk factors as they affect conflicts on multiple severity levels.\n\nThe main objective of this contribution is to construct and contribute to the establishing a NEOC which will be the national hub for all emergency management planning and response, and the host the Federal Government (FG) level strategic response during a disaster situation in coordination and collaboration of the Federal Member States.",

NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out \u201cthe Humanitarian Programme for 2021\u201d in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.\n\nThe objectives of NRC\u2019s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC's principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.\n\nNRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC's programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.\n\nNRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. \n\nThe intervention\u2019s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida\u2019s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach \u2013 PBA).\n\nHumanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus\nNRC's catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC's advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC's analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC's portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden's development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.",

        "title": "FAO HUM 2021-2025",
        "description": "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. The organisation's goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With over 194 member states, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide.\n\nFAO works side by side with the other two Rome-based UN agencies \u2013 the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to promote food security by alleviating hunger through emergency food assistance as well as more long-term support to eliminate the root causes of food insecurity. While WFP\u2019s main comparative advantage lies in its capacity for large-scale food response, logistics, telecommunications and procurement capacity, the advantage of FAO lies in its role as the world\u2019s agricultural knowledge agency with its unique agricultural expertise but also in its holistic approach to humanitarian crises, which includes analysis of the entire food system, including cultivation, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing and consumption.\n\nFAO also plays an important normative role, through international agreements, codes of conduct, and voluntary guidelines as well as policy dialogue at global, regional and national levels and advocacy in areas relevant to FAO\u2019s mandate.\n\nAlignment with strategy\n\nThe objectives of FAO are in line with the strategy for Sweden's Humanitarian Assistance through Sida (2021-2025) and through its operations, FAO is strengthening the capacity and effectiveness of the humanitarian system. The contribution is relevant for all objectives in the strategy, with an emphasis on the strategy area on protection and assistance to crisis affected populations.\n\nThis is an appraisal and subsequent decision of a new contribution (Decision on Contribution, Rule for Managing Contributions 2.9 \u00a7) between Sida and FAO, to allow for humanitarian response in four crises for 2021.\n\nThis decision also includes support for rapid response to new and deteriorating humanitarian crises through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) and Method-Development support through the Global Food Security Cluster.\n\nThis decision concerns a financial contribution to FAO amounting to 102 000 000 SEK.\n\nReasons for the decision\n\nEvaluation 2020\n\nDuring 2020, the humanitarian assistance unit at Sida conducted an overview of ongoing strategic partnerships in order to ensure that partnership was established with the most relevant and effective humanitarian actors to carry out Sweden\u2019s strategy for humanitarian assistance through Sida (2021 \u2013 2025). As a result of the overview, Sida has decided to appraise a new contribution and enter into a new strategic partnership agreement with FAO, see decision 2021-000057.\n\nComparative Advantage of FAO:\n\nBased on the organisation\u2019s mandate to build a world without hunger through technical cooperation and assistance, FAO has a unique role to play in humanitarian settings. Through its long-standing country presence, technical expertise in agriculture and food systems, as well as expertise and experience in both humanitarian assistance and development cooperation, FAO is well-placed to address both acute hunger as well as to support countries experiencing food crises to return to normality and building resilience to future chocks. By protecting livelihoods through emergency agricultural assistance, FAO is hence able to provide emergency interventions that save lives and safeguard livelihoods in the short-term while at the same time strengthening resilience in the face of future crises.\n\nFAO\u2019s comparative advantages were also highlighted by Sida\u2019s evaluation of its strategic partners, which stated that FAO, apart from being a strong player within the thematic areas of food security and livelihoods, also demonstrated strong capacity regarding resilience and nexus programming. The evaluation also concluded that FAO has a comparative advantage in its utilisation of partnerships with local actors and development agencies, which not only ensure sustainability of its interventions but also in many cases means that FAO has good indirect access in remote and hard to reach areas. Finally, the evaluation also recognised FAO\u2019s technical expertise as a valuable comparative advantage and highlighted FAO\u2019s participation in technical working groups and its leadership role in the food security clusters as well as its contribution to HNO/HRP processes. Specifically, the evaluation highlighted the Sida supported FSNAU intervention as an example of an FAO intervention that was instrumental in providing early warning to the humanitarian system in Somalia, which contributed to avert famine during the severe drought in 2017.\n\nSida\u2019s Humanitarian Follow Up and Field Missions to FAO Responses:\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic the staff at Sida\u2019s unit for humanitarian assistance based in Stockholm were not able to make as many field follow-ups as per normal. Humanitarian focal points stationed in the Foreign Missions have been crucial to conduct follow-up, as well as digital tools that have allowed for remote monitoring and follow-up. Overall, the conclusions of continuous dialogue, monitoring and follow-up show that FAO is a professional humanitarian actor which, through its extensive network of partners, has the ability to gain access to very remote and hard to reach areas. Sida also notes that FAO in several contexts through its vast technical expertise, plays an important role in technical working groups and coordination fora in the project countries.\n\nTHE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN SITUATION 2021\n\nAccording to the Global Humanitarian Overview, in 2021, 235 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance and protection \u2013 a substantial increase compared to 2020 which started out with nearly 168 million people in need. Thus resulting in yet another year with the highest number of people in need ever recorded by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In parallel with staggering numbers of people in need, the funding gap increases and according to OCHA\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS), response plans and appeals were only 46% funded in 2020, compared to 61% in 2019. In 2021 the UN and partner organisations aim to help 160 million people most in need across 56 countries, with an estimated requirement of 35 billion USD.\n\nBoth the increase in people in need and funding gap can be partly derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. Putting additional pressure onto an already strained humanitarian system with limited resources. Although COVID-19 has definitely been centre stage during 2020, there are still other worrying trends affecting the global humanitarian outlook for 2021.\n\nFirst, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the vulnerability of the least protected populations. The pandemic has triggered the deepest global recession since the 1930s. Extreme poverty has risen for the first time in 22 years, and unemployment has increased dramatically. The impact of the socio-economic situation will continue to have serious implications on humanitarian needs in 2021.\n\nSecond, political conflicts are more intense and are taking a heavy toll on civilians, disproportionally affecting children. Women and girls are at increased risk of conflict-related sexual violence. As such, protecting those affected by armed conflict is more crucial than ever. The lack of respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) continues to be one of the most pressing challenges. Armed conflicts continue to cause enormous suffering, including violations of IHL, such as killings, torture, abductions and displacements. Applying a protection lens/Centrality of Protection approach is essential \u2013 in light of the protection crises such as the Syria crisis - now active for more than a decade; Yemen - being the largest humanitarian crisis worldwide; the DR Congo; the Venezuela crisis; the Nagorno-Karabach situation and the Rohingya crisis \u2013 just to mention a few.\n\nThird, hunger is on the rise, with conflict the main driver of acute hunger for 77 million people in 22 countries. By the end of 2020, the number of acutely food insecure people could be 270 million. The impacts of the pandemic and climate change are seriously affecting food systems worldwide.\n\nFourth, climate change exacerbate humanitarian needs and extreme weather events. The desert locust outbreak from late 2019 was the worst in 25 years in the Horn of Africa.  A series of flooding situations have taken place in 2020 where we have seen increased humanitarian needs and the displacement of vulnerable populations in contexts such as Sahel, South-East Asia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and South Sudan.   \n\nFifth, as a result of the above, displacements are at record high levels. Conflict, violence and natural disasters drive people to seek refuge in either their country of origin or by crossing international borders. The majority of the 80 million people living in displacement have been forced to seek refuge due to natural disasters. The number of refugees, most of which seek refuge in neighbouring countries, has doubled from 10 million to 20 million in 10 years.\n\nSida\u2019s humanitarian allocation to FAO in 2021\n\nSida\u00b4s humanitarian assistance is based on the four humanitarian principles, in particular impartiality, with its compelling urge to ensure that humanitarian action is carried out based on needs alone, giving priority to the most urgent cases of distress. Hence, Sida\u2019s allocation methodology is grounded in several objective indicators such as; the scale of humanitarian needs (number of people in need), the severity of humanitarian needs (including food insecurity/IPC levels), the number of people targeted for the humanitarian response, the financial coverage of the respective humanitarian appeal, national capacities to respond and underlying risks, as well as distinct indicators related to forgotten crises. The allocation and subsequent disbursement of funds takes place in the beginning of the year to ensure predictability for Sida\u2019s strategic humanitarian partners and to allow for optimal operational planning.\n\nBased on Sida's humanitarian needs-based allocation process in late 2020 the following is proposed for FAO in 2021:\n\n- Annual Projects/Programmes in line with Humanitarian Response Plans (usually 12 months) - 67 000 000 SEK\n- Rapid Response Mechanism (SFERA) - 25 000 000 SEK\n- Method Development and Capacity-Building - 2 000 000 SEK\n\nThis means that the total initial contribution to FAO in 2021 amounts to 94 000 000 SEK.\n\nAnnual Projects/Programmes (in line with the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plans):\n\n- Afghanistan: 30 000 000 SEK\n\n- Nigeria: 9 000 000 SEK\n\n- Somalia: 12 000 000 SEK\n\n- Somalia (FSNAU): 4 000 000 SEK\n\n- South Sudan: 12 000 000 SEK\n\nRapid Response Mechanism or unallocated funds:\n\n- SFERA: 25 000 000 SEK\n\nMethod- and capacity-building support\n\n- Global Food Security Cluster: 2 000 000 SEK",

        "description": "Sida has supported the CBPFs since the establishment of the very first fund in Angola, already back in 1999. Since then, Sida has been one of the largest donors to the CBPFs. During 2019, the CBPFs received 956 million USD in financial contributions to respond to humanitarian needs in 18 countries. \n\nThe CBPFs fund UN, NGOs and the Red Cross/Red Crescent Society. During the years, the CBPFs has increased its funding to local actors. In 2014 they reached 11% with direct funding, compared to todays 31 %.   \n\nCBPFs are locally managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator and in consultation with the humanitarian community. Advisory Boards oversee the Funds, providing advice on key decisions, and ensuring efficient and effective management. The daily management of the funds is overseen by a Fund Manager, monitoring officers and financial officers. At the global level, the Pooled Fund Working Group brings together key stakeholders (representing donors, NGOs and UN agencies) to provide policy guidance. \n\nThe main value added of the CBPF will be ensuring an efficient humanitarian response due to the specific strengths the fund entails:\n\n1) Proximity to the response: The CBPFs aims to address humanitarian needs through a structure with high degree of local expertise of both the humanitarian situation and the humanitarian actors on the ground.\n\n2) Humanitarian Coordination: The CBPF has a strategic objective of ensuring the implementation of the Humanitarian Response Plan and its various components/ programmes. The Humanitarian Coordinator can hence direct funding to critical components in the HRP that are underfunded. The Humanitarian Coordinator can also at any time direct humanitarian funding to sudden onset emergencies or quickly deteriorating crises, through the quick funding mechanism called \u201cEmergency Reserve\u201d. The overall coordination is naturally strengthened by the fact that the ultimate authority of the mandate lies with the Humanitarian Coordinator who is the overall coordinator of the UN lead humanitarian response in any given country. \n\n3) Reach the best placed actors, which in many cases are local actors who has the expertise and humanitarian access. The CBPF can support local actors in responding to the humanitarian needs. This has been particularly useful when local actors have shown to have the local expertise needed to adequately formulate smaller local responses and also having humanitarian access to areas not accessible by international actors. During 2019, the CBPF allocated 25% directly to local actors and in some countries up to 50% is allocated directly to local partners.",

The diaspora have also acquired knowledge, experience and education in their new countries. The Somali diaspora have furthermore very active associations, they are sending financial remittances back and follows the political developments in Somalia carefully. The engagement is also reflected in the Results Strategy for Sweden's International Development Cooperation with Somalia 2013-2017; highlighting the diaspora involvement as a key part of the strategy. Forum Syd\u2019s Diaspora Programme in Somalia 2015-2017 complements the financial remittances by enabling social remittances by Somali diaspora organisations to strengthen marginalised groups and the weak civil society organisations in Somalia. This programme is also complementing interventions by international organisations and the UN by directly focusing on Somali capacity to handle Somali problems. The programme is in addition to this complementing Sida\u2019s other support focusing in the diaspora to IOM for diaspora experts to return to work in ministries in Somalia and a planned intervention focusing on the diaspora and the private sector. \n\nThe engagement of the Swedish-Somali diaspora is also the foundation of the Forum Syd's Diaspora Programme in Somalia 2015-2017. This programme will build on a pilot project by Forum Syd on the Somali diaspora, which has been running 2012-2014 with Sida funding. The suggested continuation of Forum Syd's programme will expand the scope of the programme with the main objective being; \"Greater participation of marginalised people, particularly women and youth (rights holders) and civil society organisations in decision making processes, within the target areas of Somalia\". Under the main objective Forum Syd will focus on five outcome areas including: democracy and human rights, gender equality, sustainable livelihoods, regional initiatives (to enhance the collaboration between different regions of Somalia, focusing on civil society) and capacity building. \n\nThis programme is expanding the sub-granting scheme to projects implemented by Somali diaspora organisations together with local partners in Somalia that was used during the pilot phase of the programme 2012-2014. In addition to this, the programme is expanded with a \u201cregional initiative\u201d aiming at bridging the fragmentation of the Somali society caused by the civil war through civil society engagement to build trust between different groups. The programme will furthermore support local partners in Somalia directly focusing on capacity development to enable more organisations to participate in the programme. The programme will be implemented during three years, 2015-2017 and Forum Syd will open an office in Hargeisa as well as establishing presence in Galkayo and Mogadishu. The support to the diaspora organisations in Sweden will remain under the Stockholm office.",

        "description": "One effect of the long civil war in Somalia is the huge flows of refugees, which has created a global Somali diaspora and a brain drain of human capital from Somalia. The diaspora have also acquired knowledge, experience and education in their new countries. The Somali diaspora have furthermore very active associations, they are sending financial remittances back and follows the political developments in Somalia carefully. The engagement is also reflected in the Results Strategy for Sweden's International Development Cooperation with Somalia 2013-2017; highlighting the diaspora involvement as a key part of the strategy. Forum Syd\u2019s Diaspora Programme in Somalia 2015-2017 complements the financial remittances by enabling social remittances by Somali diaspora organisations to strengthen marginalised groups and the weak civil society organisations in Somalia. This programme is also complementing interventions by international organisations and the UN by directly focusing on Somali capacity to handle Somali problems. The programme is in addition to this complementing Sida\u2019s other support focusing in the diaspora to IOM for diaspora experts to return to work in ministries in Somalia and a planned intervention focusing on the diaspora and the private sector. \n\nThe engagement of the Swedish-Somali diaspora is also the foundation of the Forum Syd's Diaspora Programme in Somalia 2015-2017.

As highlighted in the Economic Recovery Plan, issues around job creation, economic growth and private sector development will lie at the heart of Somali recovery and reconstruction.\n\nAccordingly, the overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the long-term reconstruction of the conflict ridden society in Somalia through increased human security and improved livelihoods, while the specific objective of the intervention is employment creation and improved incomes for those economically active specifically for women and youth across the country. The programme is intended to be catalytic and engage the diaspora for the purpose of leveraging funds as well as transferring knowledge. With strong entrepreneurial propensities and cultural linkages to Somalia, the Somali diaspora in Sweden and elswhere can play an important part in developing businesses that can create jobs in Somalia. It is important to clarify that the programme does not only target the diaspora but Somali entrepreneurs in the country are also eligible for the programme.\n\nThe programme employs  a comprehensive approach that consists of four major components which are intended to complement each other:\n1. A Capacity Development Facility (CDF) for interested entrepreneurs and potential grantees. the CDF will be divided into a general capacity development in business development as well as a tailor-made capacity development for grantees.\n2. A Challenge Fund module that offers financing to entrepreneurs at an early stage of\nthe business venture in order to enable them to explore opportunities and start up a business with potential for job creating opportunities.\n3. Access to more capital support function which is intended to support grantees and interested entrepreneurs to access financing from other challenge funds or through Sida\u2019s guarantee systems for larger finances.\n4. A Scale up analysis module which is intended to collect and convey analysed market data into the New Deal/PSG4 policy level for improved policies that will contribute to enabling environment for business throughout the country.\n\nBy combining these four components the programme puts in place the necessary prerequisites for successful and sustainable business creation and hence increased productive employment. The engagement of the diaspora will not only leverage funds and businesses but will also contribute to knowledge transfer in the long term. Furthermore, the data collected from the programme through its scale up analysis module will be expected to contribute to positive changes at the policy level and hopefully have bigger positive impact at the national level.\n\nThe programme has identified opportunities in certain sectors which is believed could have potential to have wider impact on business growth and hence contribute to productive employment. These identified sectors are: Agriculture, fisheries, healthcare, ICT, renewable energy and water & sanitation. However, while projects of high quality from these sectors will be prioritized the bottom line of the programme still lies in the creation of productive employment in a sustainable manner within any given sector.",

It will build a skill set amongst IDPs to document and advocate on human rights violations against their community(ies), both at the national and international level. The project will work with Somali actors to create a cadre of human rights enablers within the IDP community itself and those that provide legal representation to them.  An independent Civilian Oversight Board (COB) over the Somali National Police Force will be established in areas containing the highest number of IDPs. The project will be commenced in Mogadishu and expanded in the southern and central regions of Somalia over three years. \n\nThe intervention\u2019s total budget is 10 167 500 SEK (1 089 689 USD) , out of which approximately 1 million SEK is supposed to be contributed by another donor (discussions are ongoing with UN WOMEN). Approximately 1 300 000 SEK (142 290 USD) of the intervention budget will be forwarded from LAW to the Somali NGO Witness Somalia for the coordination of the establishment of civilian oversight boards.",

Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.",

        "description": "Displacement, cramped living conditions and other related stressors following flooding all serve to exacerbate tensions and increase violence in the home and in communities, with women and girls most at risk. With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries. Approximately 50 (20 girls and women) will be engaged in GBV safety audit and action planning in their communities. 4,000 (1,220girls,1,260 women, 800 boys and 720 men) will be reached through door to door community outreach and over 25,000 reached through GBV radio advocacy and awareness creation. 450 dignity kits and 250 emergency support kits and 2000 sanitary kits will be distributed. Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management. Through the two WGSS, a total of 800(400 women and girls) will be reached through weekly GBV prevention and response sessions.",

        "description": "In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region. There were more than 5 accidents with fatalities and casualties in the Danyiile district alone this year which includes children and persons with no knowledge of Explosive ordinances.\n\nIn Afgooye about 191,143 persons standing as 100% of the population severity level no 3 described as degrading which puts them highly in need of protection against the explosive substances. Of these 56,000 are IDPs from the floods and other natural calamities while 135,431 are host communities according to the data recently shared by the protection cluster on HNO.\n\nExplosive ordinances contamination presents a barrier to development, and encumber livelihood activities particularly it affected IDPs, returnees, animal herders, and the rural poor families.",

These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.

A predetermined beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . These criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use M and E tools that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. This action shall deliver urgent humanitarian flood response assistance in the form of cash for NFIs and ESKs to 1,350 HHs (8,100 individuals) in district Belet Weyne.\n\nTo ensure that the assistance provided is used for intended purposes, NRC s will coordinate all components of this action with the community to ensure thorough sensitization and beneficiary participation  for individuals and the community at large .A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash and while also assess the impact of the response, generate and document lessons learned for dissemination to multiple stakeholders.",

        "description": "Humanitarian situation in Middle Shabelle has deteriorated due ongoing flooding in last two consecutive rainy seasons and now communities in low lying areas along the Juba and Shabelle river valleys in south central Somalia are grappling with a new wave of flooding during Hagaa season due to the intensive rains started within the Ethiopian highlands. The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

        "description": "The impact of the ongoing flooding compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict, and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

        "description": "Merka communities face scarcity of safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods coupled with the effect of pandemic since march 2020. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

        "description": "With the complex and unpredictable humanitarian situation in Somalia and with the reduced risk of famine in the year 2019, the overall risk still lingers. Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement this intervention in 31 sites across Burao and Buhodle (16 sites in Burao and 15 sites in Buhodle). \n\nFEWS NET Post Deyr technical release projects that in Togdheer region of Somaliland that 181,000 people will be stressed IPC phase 2, 91,000 in crisis IPC phase 3 and 13,000 in emergency IPC phase 4 by June, 2020 if humanitarian assistance is not extended to the region. \n\nCamp coordination and camp management is a relatively new concept within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized on this concept.

NoFYL will implement a multi-cluster intervention around Protection and CCCM aiming at strengthening coordination structures, improving the coordination, community-led site maintenance activities to ensure the upkeep of sites, support governance structures to ensure community participation and self-management of sites and information management at a site level, sites improvement activities to minimize protection risks and ensure safety in sites. \nOn protection, the intervention is geared toward preventing and responding to eviction, monitoring of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant clusters to mobilize support for advocacy. The advocacy and campaigns will aim to ensure actors facilitate lawful eviction processes. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, local authorities on Housing, Land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). WASH intervention will be complemented by PAH through the distribution of complete kits of hygiene, capacity building of water committees and community hygiene promotion through community outreach and awareness campaigns, addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs. ESNFI intervention will be complemented by HINNA by improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and emergency shelter kits.\n\nAt the initial stages of project implementation, the partners will organize an inception meeting with different actors with the support of the relevant cluster Coordinators. Rapid service mapping of actors will also be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervention areas and avoid duplication. NoFYL field teams shall actively participate in coordination mechanisms in Kaxda and Deynille to ensure other actors are updated on NoFYL plans in targeted districts to avoid overlap. This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI, CCCM, Protection, and WASH support and complement activities undertaken under other ongoing projects. NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation. The synergy between the 3 sectoral partners will ensure sound management of the program, greater impact, efficiency, and more cost-effective operations.

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

        "description": "Despite a favorable Deyr (October- December) rainy season, the lingering effects of the drought in 2018/2019, and flooding an estimated 1.3 million people in Somalia will be in Crisis (IPC Phase3) through mid-2020 without sustained humanitarian assistance. Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019. PDM also monitors expenditure patterns of the provided support and determines measures for corrective actions if there are deviations from objective.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is that the food security situation of 865 vulnerable households (5160 individuals) in mostly rural communities in Zeylac district of Somaliland is stabilized and communities are more resilient towards adverse conditions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers: a) unconditional and b) conditional cash transfers for improved access to food. The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

The 7-month project will be implemented in 10 villages in Abudwak. The project has two outputs. Output one will contribute to 400 food-insecure households (2400 people \u2013 1224 Male and 1176 Female) having immediate access to food through unconditional Cash transfer. Of these,  200 HH are IDPs located in Abudwaq town. \nOutput 2 targets 1,632 HH (9794 people) in the protection and restoration of their livelihoods for increased food and income sources. Of these, 900 HH will benefit from animal treatment meant to restore approximately 27,000 livestock to better health. This intervention will improve the livestock economic value as well as the value of meat and milk for household consumption. 6,000 additional and emaciated livestock will receive animal feed concentrate for a month to help them recover their health and increase production. The project will install a solar-powered pumping system to pump water from the Dalsan village borehole to the elevated village water tank which will then use gravity to distribute to the village water kiosk and livestock watering troughs that were constructed by NAPAD with funding from German-FFO. Over 430 HH in Dalsan will benefit from climate and economic friendly source of water for their livestock estimated to be 12,960. To increase household access to nutritious food 100 women will be supported to diversify into small scale kitchen gardening of vegetables and fruits. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The farms will be designed to ensure that the least amount of water is utilized in agricultural production. Women from the Dalsan village will especially benefit from the proposed solar water pumping system that will provide water to irrigate the kitchen gardens. Inagabille households and livestock will get their water from NAPAD constructed, G-FFO funded elevated 60,000 litres tank and animal troughs. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads.

Children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) will be referred to the TFSP, while those with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) will be referred to the OTP run by SUADO. Complicated cases of SAM will be treated in the stabilization centre (SC) in Jalalaqsi. Tracing of children that have defaulted from the SC programme will be established and carried out by the SC teams. Provision of therapeutic and supplementary feeding for malnourished children lt5 and PLW will be provided during the programme period. Children not progressing well under treatment will be visited at home for counselling for their mothers. \nMercy-USA will ensure that nutrition site will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will secure agreements with WFP and UNICEF before the start of the program. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. \nMercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and provide refresher trainings for staff.\nThis programme will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. \nScreening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level, though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programme. \nChildren in the nutrition programme will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A according to IMAM guidelines. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anaemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anaemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition programme will receive deworming drugs. In addition, children in the nutrition programme will receive relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A according to Somalia IMAM guidelines. \nSerious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia.

        "description": "Evictions represent a unique protection challenge in Somalia with far-reaching consequences on physical security, dignity, and livelihood of victims. Bossosa is one of the epicenters of the problem as the region struggles to recover from the residual effects of the 2016-17 drought amid persistent insecurity, cyclic natural disasters, and widespread unlawful evictions. At the national level, Somalia is faced with the daunting prospect of rebuilding the country having been riven by more than two decades of conflict and lawlessness. Important strides are being made to address the issue but ongoing initiatives have been outmatched due to the prevalence of the problem, thus necessitating a more robust, integrated and coordinated program response. In the absence of an effective response to address protection challenges that are being exacerbated by eviction, displaced communities will remain at risk of continuing secondary displacements. Efforts to strengthen protection and contribute to durable solutions to displacement in Bossaso will be incomplete and/or undermined without addressing the issue of eviction concurrently and systematically. The project seeks to contribute towards ensuring that individuals affected by displacement receive support assistance to improve their tenure security situation and address post-eviction complications.\n\nThis action builds on NRC\u2019s hands on expertise in evictions prevention and response programming in Somalia, and targeting 37,198 individuals in Bossaso, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced communities at risk of eviction and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of log lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities aimed at reducing the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthening tenure security among displaced communities at highest risk of eviction, and consolidating the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include supporting the establishment of dedicated evictions prevention capacities at the municipality of Bossaso, replicating eviction programming best practices at the municipality, helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash, and strengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities. A parallel objective of the HLP Sub Cluster which this project will seek to advance is consolidating HLP capacity among national organization.\n\nA combination of deliverables will contribute toward the mitigation of protection risks exacerbated by evictions through integrated prevention and response initiatives ensuring that displaced communities have increased access to information and specialized services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights and supporting local mechanisms to address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion.",

In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain critical relief items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Where market conditions allow based on survey data, AVORD will adapt a Cash-based approach to implementation otherwise, an in-kind, direct distribution modality will be adapted. Disbursement of relief items will be made in close coordination with the shelter cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In each distribution, priority will be given to most vulnerable households in humanitarian emergency including the disabled, the chronically-ill, female headed households and families with the largest number of children under the age of 5. Full beneficiary details such as contact information will be captured throughout the process to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. Within 4 to 8 weeks of each distribution, a Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in the region and with other humanitarian partners including NRC and DRC with whom AVORD has signed a memorandum of cooperation, to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. \n\nFollowing a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs.

Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.\n\nOn monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. \n\nThe PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. \n\n3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM.

As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. \nThus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need \u2013 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.\nAlthough markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. \nDuring the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it's quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.\nThe main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)). The project will ensure full coordination among humanitarian service provides especially shelter cluster partners who are working in the project areas in order to avoid duplications.",

        "description": "In close coordination with NRC and DRC, AVORD has developed this proposal with the aim of delivering a holistic, integrated response to provide life-saving services to vulnerable communities in Xudur. As elaborated in the attached teaming agreement, AVORD will take lead in the provision of Non-Food Items, emergency shelters and CCCM services in Xudur while DRC and NRC will undertake complementary WASH and Protection activities respectively. Tentative implementation arrangements have been endorsed by the three agencies with a commitment to coordinate closely and target a similar target group, hence maximizing impact and efficiency of this response.\n\nUnder the present proposal, AVORD will distribute NFIs on-Food Items (NFIs) to 4,700 IDP and host community households (estimated 28,200 persons) who live in extremely poor shelter conditions. The target group include 6,768 men, 9,024 women, 3,384 boys and 3,384 girls from the IDP community and 1,692 men, 2,256 women, 846 boys and 846 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 846 men, 1,128 women, 423 boys and 423 girls will be targeted based on disability. Each registered household will be provided with 1 NFI kit comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Lamp and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for 250 newly arrived IDPs and those living in the open. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years. The number of emergency shelters to be constructed under this project has been limited to 250 since the majority of IDPs reside in private land, making it difficult to secure enough space for the construction of a large number of shelters. However, it is anticipated that IDPs will be able to use the plastic sheets that will provided as part of the NFI kit to repair damages to their current shelters.\n\nWith regards to CCCM, AVORD will setup and strengthen camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and trigger system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of 2 culturally-appropriate multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping, site monitoring and safety audits will be undertaken in close coordination with NRC, DRC, the CCCM cluster and other humanitarian partners in the area to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. Site maintenance committees in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out.\n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with a clear criterion to prioritize the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. The effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

        "description": "IDP communities in Bardera face cyclical scarcity to safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Bardera. During the most recent floods in October 2019, 90 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Bardera IDP communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. \n\nACTED will respond to this compounded risk by implementing a market-based project in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Bardera, including Bulo Ceesan, Bulo Garass, Liban, Xabalcadey, Horseed and Kulmiya IDP sites, and will serve 2634 households (15804 individuals). To ensure the sustainability of this action, ACTED will collaborate with the private sector to extend existing water networks to these communities and where necessary construct new water assets. Moreover, ACTED will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable IDP communities, whilst establishing relationships with the private sector for continued maintenance and operation of these assets.",

The project is framed around four sector areas, Shelter, WASH, Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) and Protection. NRC will intervene in the WASH sector, DRC in Protection sector while AVORD in Shelter and CCCM sectors to complement each other's activities. The project will be targeting the same locations and beneficiaries in various settlements in Xudur district.\n\n A pre-teaming agreement has been uploaded/attached to this proposal (see attached Annex-1) providing further details on the approach and rationale of the collaboration. In essence, the multi-cluster, multi-sector and multi-agency approach, will maximize assistance as different sectors and actors will be able to share critical information and inform immediate programming and re-design of programs. This approach will be useful to create synergies of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact. The interventions will support the targeted communities holistically and efficiently by providing well-tailored and packaged responses to address different needs of the people of concern. The integrated response is in line with SHF principles by prioritization direct implementation and supporting the integration of response across clusters. \n\n10 settlements will be targeted by all agencies (the name of these settlements are mentioned in attached Annex-3) and will reach 17,131 individuals (50% females) through WASH interventions that includes rehabilitation of existing productive shallow wells and installing them with complete Solar pumping system, construction of water storage facilities and distribution points. The project will improve sanitation and hygiene conditions of the target communities through construction of 450 family shared latrines with handwashing facilities, training of community based hygiene promoters to undertake awareness creation along with distribution of 1350 hygiene kits to displacement affected families. DRC will provide Protection assistance whereby AVORD will provide Shelter and CCCM assistance to the same beneficiaries. After the approval of the project, NRC and DRC will do joint needs assessment both in the district to select the most vulnerable settlements for interventions. Through this project, NRC will reach 17,131 individuals.

        "description": "In Lower Juba region and across Somalia, there are multiple threats to the health and resilience of the population due to inadequate WASH facilities. For water supply, Afmadow population is dependent on a mix of unprotected surface water sources and protected groundwater sources. Surface water sources are seasonal and usually contaminated, while protected groundwater supplies are either difficult to access to due to distance and/or not affordable due the high costs of extraction and the dominance of private sector entrepreneurs in their operation, often resulting in rates that the lower income communities cannot afford to access a minimum quantity of water per person per day (Sphere).\nIn this context, ARC will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1) Rehabilitation and/or extension of 5 existing water infrastructures to provide reliable and sustained access to safe water based on identified strategic community water points to flood affected communities in Afmadow district. (2) Establishment of 5 gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women participation in WASH projects. (3) Installation of new and/or rehabilitation of 600 sanitation facilities that are lockable from inside, gender segregated, with hand washing facilities, disaster sensitive with appropriate disaster mitigation features designs. As part of ensuring protection mainstreaming, ARC will install solar light near communal sanitation facilities or if this is not feasible will provide with individual household\u2019s solar lamp/torch. (4) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution to enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness and enable good practices. Significant amount of the above proposed WASH activities will be implemented through Market Based Programming (MBP) approach as to strengthen local markets. \n The proposed WASH project will complement set of emergency Health, Protection and livelihood interventions currently ongoing in the targeted areas of Afmadow district through other funding to ensure a comprehensive approach to reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with diseases and hazards resulting from deficient sanitation conditions, the lack of access to safe water and low level of good hygiene practices. ARC\u2019s WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. Approximately 24,000 people (4,000 households) will benefit from this intervention. All ARC WASH programs are community led, and leverage stakeholder cooperation to ensure safe, equitable, and dignified access to WASH services for all. Under Health sector, ARC is supporting one MCH (Bosnia) in Dhobley and would start Outreach health services in Afmadow town targeting IDP sites with vulnerable individuals having difficult access to basic lifesaving health services. ARC would also provide un-conditional cash transfer to vulnerable groups in Dhobley for 3 months aiming to improve food security situation as well as the nutrition indicators. ARC\u2019s integrated approach combining the WASH intervention with health and nutrition components ensures greater impact in the area of operation. Adequate WASH improves the overall public health indicators, including the lower incidence of communicable diseases, reduced mother and child morbidity and stronger effects of nutrition interventions as a result of prevention of loss of valuable nutrients from diarrheal diseases.",

        "description": "Through this Action, PAH (Polish Humanitarian Action) together with NoFYL (Northern Frontier Youth League) and HINNA (Women Pioneers for Peace and Life) propose integrated response that aims to respond to the urgent needs of IDPs in Banadir region through implementation of Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM), WASH, Protection and Shelter/NFIs activities. PAH, NoFYL and HINNA will implement a multi cluster intervention aiming at 1) CCCM: improving the coordination and information management at site level 2) WASH: addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs in this field 3) PROTECTION: mainstreaming protection through (a) preventing and response to eviction, including monitoring threats of evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant cluster to mobilize support for advocacy (b) To advocacy and campaigns that aim to ensure lawful eviction processes (c) Capacity development of settlement managers, local authorities in the field of housing, land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). 4) SHELTER: improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and construction of Transitional shelters.\nActivities will be implemented by PAH, NoFYL and HINNA in 2 districts (Kaxda and Deynile) of Banadir region. Activities will target the most undeserved areas of these districts that host mostly newly displaced IDPs due to drought and conflicts. Approximately 17,400 people (3,283 men, 6505 Boys, 9,710 girls and 4,886 women) including 3658 people with disability will directly benefit from this intervention. It will also benefit an entire community working in targeted IDP sites, including local authorities, clusters and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach and synergies enable the partners to concentrate services and expertise within the same location and same population, leading to a greater impact.\n\nMoreover, PAH acts as WASH Cluster co-lead at national cluster level, NoFYL is part of SRCs and member of CCCM and protection cluster, while HINNA is a member of shelter cluster in Banadir region. This allows to ensure a great capacity for project implementation and a strong understanding of the cluster strategy. Each partner will directly implement activities of their specialization sector. The coordination among partners will be done throughout an entire implementation process to ensure synergies and combine services delivery for all sectors. The partners will jointly conduct periodic monitoring activities to assess implementation of the project, collect feedback from beneficiaries and adjust implementation accordingly if needed. This will be done through harmonized tools that will be developed during the project kick-off meeting. Furthermore, NoFYL, while  providing protection services to IDPs, will also ensure that protection is mainstreamed throughout WASH activities conducted by PAH  as well as Shelter activities conducted by HINNA,  by providing relevant training and ensuring strong coordination.",

        "description": "EGEP-T aims to increase girls\u2019 learning in numeracy, literacy and life skills, whilst supporting them through key transition points in education and beyond to improved life opportunities. The project will also be developing community and institutional capacity to ensure support to girls\u2019 education is sustained in the longer term. EGEP saw significant progress regarding community members\u2019 expectations of girls about girls\u2019 education between baseline and midline. General support for girls\u2019 education increased by 27% across community members surveyed and the percentage of caregivers stating gender to be an important factor determining whether a child should go to school declined from 54% to 9%. Respondents frequently noted that community members themselves are engaging in awareness-raising activities. School enrolment increased by 20% and attendance increased by 5%, which suggests this positive shift in attitudes has led to positive results in school. Learning levels increased, however, they did not reach the intended targets. 37% of girls who enter secondary school have dropped out by Form 4. A contributing factor behind these less positive trends appears to be that the aspirations of caregivers and communities for girls\u2019 education can be at odds with the considerable expectations placed on girls in terms of traditionally assigned gender roles. EGEP conducted 70 FGDs with girls, asking them what the most critical challenges were that lead to girls\u2019 decreased participation in school in later grades: after economic factors, the most common response was early marriage, and the third most common response was household chores. Additionally, girls are often expected to prioritise care of siblings or contribution to household income over schooling and homework. These expectations intensify as the girl reaches adolescence. Furthermore, within the school, girls are not necessarily expected to achieve at the same level as boys, to hold leadership positions, and to complete the full education cycle. The table below provides examples of severely marginalised groups of girls the project will target, the current expectations for these groups and how they differ from what the project intends to achieve:",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

        "description": "This project aims at restoring stable communities in Somalia through establishing local structures that research, identify, analyse, prioritize and implement solutions to community security issues, in collaboration with local authorities, formal security actors and civil society. At the state level, it will re-establish bodies that promote community-responsive policing, acting as a link through which information on security provision is channelled, and form bridges between local, state and national levels. Learning and insights from all levels will be fed upwards through national-level civil society networks, promoting community-focused security provision at national and international level. The objectives of the programme are to strengthen the capacity of local civil society groups and communities to research and facilitate broad dialogue across clan and state-society divides about local security issues, provide resources for implementation of joint conflict prevention and community security initiatives, support cross-regional community exchange to share experiences and common security problems, link community members with existing dispute resolution mechanisms, support the re-introduction and development of regional oversight mechanisms such as police accountability committees with channels for community input, provide training on accountability, gender- and conflict-sensitivity, link these bodies into a cross-regional learning network, facilitate their engagement in policy dialogue at the federal member state level, conduct policy discourse with the Somali federal government, regional bodies and international actors to communicate evidence about inclusive approaches to improving human security, and facilitate dialogue among policy-makers at the national level and communities. This will eventually result in a reduction in inter and intra-clan division and violence, more inclusive, responsive and accountable security provision including effective mechanisms to prevent misuse of power and improve coordination, greater coherence in policy formation between Federal regions, and more evidence-based policy and programming on human security from international actors.",

The pentavalent vaccine, administered in a three-dose schedule, offers protection against five diseases: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), heptatitis B and Haemophilius influenzae type b. Until 2013, GAVI has helped to introduce the pentavalent in 70 of the 73 GAVI-eligible countries, with the aim of reaching all 73 by the end of 2014. GAVI support for pentavalent vaccine is in line with WHO recommendations, for routine infant immunisation and primarily targeting children under one year of age.",

As well as threatening species with extinction, IWT destroys vital ecosystems. IWT also fosters corruption, feeds insecurity, and undermines good governance and the rule of law. The UK government is committed to tackling illegal trade of wildlife products. Defra manages the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, which is a competitive grants scheme with the objective of tackling illegal wildlife trade and, in doing so, contributing to sustainable development in developing countries. Projects funded under the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund address one, or more, of the following themes: \u2022 Developing sustainable livelihoods to benefit people directly affected by IWT \u2022 Strengthening law enforcement \u2022 Ensuring effective legal frameworks \u2022 Reducing demand for IWT products Over \u00a323 million has been committed to 75 projects since the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund was established in 2013; five projects were awarded in 2014 (via applications to the Darwin Initiative), fourteen in 2015, fifteen in 2016, thirteen in 2017, fourteen in 2018 and in the latest round in 2019. This round of funding includes the following projects (details of which can be found at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/811381/iwt-project-list-2019.pdf)): IWT062, IWT063, IWT064, IWT065, IWT066, IWT067, IWT068, IWT069, IWT070, IWT071, IWT072, IWT073, IWT074, IWT075.",

Countries introducing IPV received a one-time cash grant from Gavi, funded by GPEI, to support some of the additional activity costs related to introducing the new vaccine. These activities may include health worker training, social mobilisation, micro-planning, expansion or rehabilitation of cold chain equipment, printing of materials (such as immunisation cards), technical assistance and modifications to the surveillance systems.",

        "description": "Quality of content produced by Somalian media is in general of a very low quality. Most people working in the media learned by doing without a proper journalistic education. Media outlets often lack a proper business model and editorial policies. To some extent this leads to envelope journalism (taking money to make stories without fact checking), and biased reporting. A lack of capacity to develop diverse broadcast and content formats allowing for meaningful interaction with audiences, is apparent in nearly all media outlets. Content often consists of long monologues or interviews, with no real programmes on social issues. Items often cover leading (political) figures, conferences or meetings and no personal stories or citizen accounts. Journalists often do not cover social issues and are unaware of their potential for agenda setting. Women are underrepresented in the Somali media. Gender inequalities are evident in media ownership, decision-making in media houses and in media content. Somali civil society organisations and women's organisations are not used to collaborate with the media to set the agenda and influence Somali authorities in development of laws and policies. The involvement of Civil Society Organisations in the public debate is limited and they play a modest role in lobby and advocacy. Safety is another important issue. According to the annual report of the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), the grim toll for 2014 was as follows: five media workers murdered in Mogadishu, Galkayo and Baidoa; five journalists injured; 47 journalists arrested; five media houses attacked. With these figures Somalia is one of the most dangerous places on earth for journalists. Media associations such as Somaliland Journalist Association (SOLJA) and NUSOJ were not yet capable of implementing a self-regulatory framework. Associations of Somali journalists are under developed. The media law that foresees amongst others the set- up of a regulatory body has not been approved or implemented yet. By consequence no regulatory body that holds unethical media stations accountable is operational.",

        "description": "Some 1.5 billion people, half of the world\u2019s poor, live in fragile settings where the government is unable or unwilling to fulfill its core responsibilities to protect and care for its citizens. In such fragile settings, often characterized by variable levels of violent conflict, perspectives for stability and sustainable inclusive development - key priorities of the Dutch Government - continue to be extremely bleak. Whereas each fragile setting is unique, a broad international consensus exists on the multiple and complex causes that need to be addressed for a transition out of fragility. Among these, establishing inclusive governance processes is considered essential. A key obstacle for achieving stability and sustainable development in fragile settings is the structural exclusion of segments of society from local, district level and national governance processes. Our theory of change (TOC) addresses this with a focus on inclusive governance processes, referring to the extent to which governance processes provide space to overcome the systematic exclusion of disadvantaged groups seeking to participate in decision making. Therefore this strategic partnership\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to inclusive and effective governance processes in fragile settings. Specific target and impact groups may vary country by country and will be determined on the basis of thorough analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of women in governance processes is key to stability and development in all countries and therefore crosscuts all program interventions.",

Increase access to, utilisation and quality of health and nutrition services at community, primary and secondary health levels, especially for women, children and vulnerable populations and; 2. Strengthen the health system under the stewardship of the Somali Health Authorities (SHAs). The project\u2019s approach focuses on strengthening the SHAs\u2019 capacity at the regional, district and community levels to deliver the EPHS (core services 1-6). Lessons from Joint Health Nutrition Programme (JHNP) and other programmes, identified a critical management gap at the district level in Banadir. A core focus of the project\u2019s methodology is therefore to support the Regional health Officer (RHO) in Banadir to establish and develop a District Health Management Team (DHMT) in each of the 10-targeted districts. Having an operational management body at district level, within the SHA structure, will be an essential component of ensuring that the health facilities and community/female health workers (CHWs/FHWs), in their respective districts, are able to receive the technical, management and logistical support required for them to successfully deliver integrated, quality, health and nutrition services that the population can access. This is a structure and model that has been demonstrated to be successful in other health systems (e.g. in Kenya). The consortium will work closely with the RHO throughout the project to establish, develop and support the DHMTs.",

        "description": "A locust invasion in Somalia is threatening livelihoods as crops and vegetation for livestock foraging suffer extensive damage. According to the Somaliland National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) localized damage has been observed in Somaliland, where locusts have occupied a total of 100,000ha of Somaliland\u2019s coastal region including Woqooyi Galbeed. This has affected1,087,264 people, of which 22,853 are in IDPs camps. SC has observed the impact of the locust invasion to be most severe in Hargeisa Maroodijeh with 8,000ha of rangeland and 3,000ha of crop land damaged. In addition, Agabar and Arbasiyo villages in Gabiley districts have also been hard-hit with 1,000ha of damaged land. The Woqooyi Galbeed region was already characterized by significant food security gaps which is exacerbated by the desert locust crisis. According to the FSNAU technical release 153,000 people are food insecure (IPC 3 or 4) including 12,054 in Gabiley district and 139,134 in Hargeisa district. An SC survey showed that pastoralists are skipping meals or selling their remaining livestock for low prices to purchase food. There is also an increasing trend of labor migration at the critical time of Gu seasonal preparation. Only few actors respond to the locust crisis in this area including SOS and World Vision. Response gaps affirmed by the Food Security Cluster (FSC) monthly dashboard show 150,000 people need urgent Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to protect access to food security. These include IDPs and pastoralists who have lost their livestock and have less than 6 goats. In addition to the locust crisis, Somalia is also at risk of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Somalia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 16th March 2020 and currently has 60 recorded cases including 5 in Somaliland and 2 in Woqooyi Galbeed. Given the rapid pace of the virus and lack of access to testing kits, there are concerns that the number of cases will rise rapidly.",

Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden.

J\u00e4hrlich sollen ca. 146.000 Menschen von den Leistungspaketen profitieren. \u0152 \u0152Beitrag zur nationalen Umsetzung der Agenda 2030: \u0152Die somalische Regierung bekennt sich zu den Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) und hat ihren nationalen Entwicklungsplan auf diese abgestimmt. Das Vorhaben wird zu SDG 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sowie SDG 15 beitragen.",

Different justice systems work parallel to each other and the awareness of the population which route to justice to take is very low, particularly in rural areas. Government institutions and formal justice providers are primarily based in urban areas in Somaliland. Rural areas have therefore little to no access, making the informal system, Xeer, often the only one to deal with cases. This places women and youth in difficult situations as they do not form part of the elders group. Legal representation in the formal system is dire. Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs) also face considerable challenges including but not limited to social, economic legal problems, shelter, inaccessibility to land, property, security, health and education. Therefore, with the proposed action this consortium seeks to contribute to increased access to fair and effective justice in Somaliland that adequately deals with community members# grievances, in particular those faced by women, youth, IDPs and minorities",

        "description": "Access to justice in Somaliland is a complex issue. Different justice systems work parallel to each other and the awareness of the population which route to justice to take is very low, particularly in rural areas. Government institutions and formal justice providers are primarily based in urban areas in Somaliland. Rural areas have therefore little to no access, making the informal system, Xeer, often the only one to deal with cases. This places women and youth in difficult situations as they do not form part of the elders group. Legal representation in the formal system is dire. Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs) also face considerable challenges including but not limited to social, economic legal problems, shelter, inaccessibility to land, property, security, health and education. Therefore, with the proposed action this consortium seeks to contribute to increased access to fair and effective justice in Somaliland that adequately deals with community members# grievances, in particular those faced by women, youth, IDPs and minorities",

        "description": "About 4.6 million people in Somalia are food insecure and 4.2 million are in need of humanitarian assistance. The reduction in the number of people in need since early 2018 has been attributed to favourable rainfall during the Gu season (April to June) and sustained humanitarian assistance. Over 1.5 million people face acute food security Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) and approximately 3.1 million people are Stressed (IPC 2)1. Although the 2016/2017 drought has ended in most parts of Somalia, its adverse impact lingers among those who were impoverished or displaced, and pastoralists who lost all or most of their livestock, particularly in the north. Without sustained food and livelihood assistance, the latter are likely to remain in Emergency (IPC 4).\nWhile acute malnutrition rates have improved nationally to Serious from Critical, the overall prevalence of acute malnutrition remains largely unchanged from Deyr 2017/2018. Between August and December, 294,000 acutely malnourished children, including 55,000 severe cases, aged underfive, will require treatment and integrated support. The acute malnutrition burden over the next 12 months is projected to be 588,400 acutely malnourished children, including 110,500 severe cases. The persistently high levels of acute malnutrition are unlikely toreduce without addressing the underlying causes, particularly in internally displaced persons (IDP) settlements and in some rural areas",

        "description": "Somalia has experienced recurrent droughts since 2011 which have been increasingly exacerbated by climate change. Agro-pastoralistsand pastoralists have been badly affected by the 2019 drought which has caused widespread crop failure, water shortages, and depleted livestock levels.\nMore than 4.2 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019, and the number ofpeople who are food insecure is expected to increase in the coming months.  This year#s severe drought has been caused by abnormally hot, dry conditions during January-March and the failure of the rains in April-June. Most households are already adopting negativecoping strategies to mitigate food insecurity, including reducing food intake. Poor transportation and market infrastructure make it difficult for pastoralists to access markets, and there are few fed markets to provide animals with nutrition when natural pastures are inadequate. Over 80% of livestock was lost as a result of the 2017 drought, and the population of livestock herds, essential for pastoralists# food and income, have not yet recovered.\nThe impact of the 2019 drought on the water and sanitation sector has beensignificant. Water supply (boreholes, shallow wells) is severely limited and the cost of accessing water has increased sharply, representing a severe burden on insufficient household income. Existing groundwater sources contain a highly mineralized content, rendering it unsuitable for drinking, but a prior Oxfam needs assessment showed that the vast majority of households in the project area do not treat their water. Open defecation remains common, increasing protection risks for women and girls who venture outside alone or during the night or move far from dwellings to known open defecation areas.\nOxfam aims to assist at least 500,000 affected peoplewith immediate food security and WASH programming along with resilience and recovery interventions to diminish the impact of recurring droughts on vulnerable populations. Oxfam will embed activities to strengthen the protection of women, men, boys, and girls within the EFSVL and WASH workstreams.",

The secondary objective of this pilot is to get the best examples of impact-driven SMEs in our countries and understand what it takes for them to scale-up, both their business and impact. This will allow us to improve our programme further by including working with superstar impact SMEs into our approach. Thirdly, we can use these #superstars# as best examples of the kind of companies we want to support, so to use it in our communication towards donors, investors, other Oxfam countries and other stakeholders.",

Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

Humanitarian response focuses on WaSH, EVFSL and Protection.\nOxfam has made a lot of gains through humanitarian resilience programmes which are likely to be eroded if the desert locust menace is uncontrolled. Oxfam will therefore capitalise and work with the existing community structures such as Early Warning Committees, Government line ministries, FAO and other stakeholders on the preventive and control measures.\nOxfam will prioritize safeguarding livelihoods focusing on cash intervention and locust control measures.\n\nA total of 1,056 people in coastal areas of Sool region will be reachedby the project and supported toprotect and recover their livelihoods.\n\nOxfam has vast experience in implementing conditional and unconditional cash transfer approaches in WASH, EVFSL programmes. The project will specifically focus on the Cash for Work(CfW) approach as it not only empowers individuals to spend based on their priority needs but also focuses on revamping community assets. CfW will therefore stimulate the recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroduce income flow,supporting local businesses through the purchase worktools while also encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally. The trench digging will involve large numbers of the population and will be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in an area thus benefitting the entire community and not just a few individuals.\n\nThe project will support communities to address locust spread by burying them in trenches excavated through cash for work. A total of 1,056 people will dig 26 km of trenches and drive hopper bands through cash for work, this task will continue for 30 days, 15 days per month starting in mid-March 2020. This task is expected to minimize hopper bands probability to turn to dangerous swarm level while at the same time communities will be able to access cash to help them address food insecurity situation at household level.\n\nOxfam will closely cooperate with the Somaliland Ministry of agriculture",

While there are so far only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Somalia (first case: 16 March 2020), it must be noted there are no testing facilities and tests are currently sent to South Africa. Results are received after two weeks. The country has only 15 intensive care unit beds and ranks 194th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index. Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced. The below activities would provide Oxfam Somalia and our partners with a top-up to the 50,000 GBP recently received through the CAT Fund.\nProject description / activities (including numbers to be reached):\nAn additional 100,000 GBP (50% as loan, 50% as grant) will enable Oxfam and our partners to scale up the WASH preparedness activities as well as support partner Shaqodoon on extending the COVID-19 helpline to Somalia#s Puntland State. Shaqodoon are currently in the process of completing the set-up of the helpline in Somaliland (with support from the current CAT Fund grant); to be launched by 11th April. The helpline in Puntland willfollow the same process as in Somaliland: Shaqodoon will develop the system and link it to a toll-free Coronavirus hotline providedby Puntland#s Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health will work closely with WHO and identify health personnel who will be trained in receiving and processing calls. Shaqodoon will provide pre-recorded health messages, on-site technical support and data analysis/dashboards for the Ministry.\n\nThe remaining amount will be utilised to scale up COVID-19 preparedness activities in Somaliland and Puntland, in collaboration with partners.

        "description": "On 2nd February 2020 the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of the Federal Government of Somalia has declared a national emergency (see press statement in attachment) in view of the current Desert Locust upsurge that poses a major threat to Somalia#sfragile food security situation. Food sources for people and their livestock are at risk. The Desert Locust swarms are uncommonly large and consume huge amounts of crops and forage.\nAccording to locust office of the Ministry of Agriculture and HADMA  latest report, there were huge swarm of Desert locust from Yemen that at the end September 2019 laid eggs in many locations in Somaliland. Despite controlefforts, a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak is threatening crops and pasture across Northern Somali regions. Accordingto experts, this is the worst outbreak in over 25 years in Somalia.\n\nThe situation has rapidly deteriorated in January 2020, as weather conditions have been unusually conductive to the spread of the pest. After cyclone Pawanmade landfall in early December 2019, flooding across the Horn of Africa created favourable breeding conditions for desert locusts. These conditions allow the breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locust with the formation of large numbers of swarm as FAO indicated in their latest Appeal .\nDesert Locust breeding is ongoing in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug (Mudug). An estimated 70,000 hectares of land has been invaded by hoppers and breeding adults. Once they mature the locusts areexpected to migrate in swarms and move south towards the Ethiopian border area of Somaliland as well as Jubaland, Southwest State and Hirshabelle. These swarms will be at their most destructive stage and pose a very severe risk to Deyr season food and fodder production.\nMating adults, hoppers and swarms have been detected in Northwest Somalia (between Bulhar and Silil). Hoppers and immature adults were reported on the Northwest plateau and a swarm was detected between Burao and the Ethiopian border. Hopper bands were also reported south of Bossaso, south of Las Anod (near the Ethiopian border) and in Galmudug (near Galkayo). More swarms are likely to form along the Northwest coast and plateau, which may migrate to Djibouti, Eastern Ethiopia and SouthernSomalia.\nCrop and pastures have already been damaged in Somalia impacting negatively onagropastoral and pastoral households. In December 2019, it was reported that a huge number of desert locust (still at the stage of hopper bands) hatched in differentbreeding areas of Somaliland, such as coastal areas and farming land, posing a new devastating threat to crops and pasture lands.",

While all countries need to\nrespond to COVID-19, countries with existing humanitarian crisis coupled with weak governance are\nparticularly vulnerable. When COVID-19 affects countries with protracted humanitarian crises like\nSomalia/land, vulnerable populations, particularly women headed households, the disabled and the\nelderly living in overcrowded camps or informal urban settlements will be highly vulnerable to the disease\nand its social and economic impacts unless support is given on preventative measures.The number of\npeople in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia, around 5.2 million currently, will likely sharply\nincrease in the event of COVID-19 outbreak making the already fragile situation much worse. The Locust\ninfestation is another evolving crisis andif not addressed will also have significant impact on the food\nsecurity and livelihoods of the people.\nCOVID-19 crisis will have a different and far-reaching impact on poor people, especially the vulnerable.\nAnyone can be exposed to the virus but the poor are most vulnerable as they lack financial and social\nprotections. Overcrowded IDP settlements and poor urban slums are also going to be the places where\ndisease can spread easily and quickly. To effectively address the urgent and acute humanitarian dimension\nof the crisis, we need to frame that within our understanding of how inequality plays out. Women will be\nas susceptible to getting infected by the virus but their need for support is greater because, as in any crisis,\nwomen including elderly women, bear the greater responsibility of caring for the family and making both\nends meet. Women#s multiple burdens of needing to contribute to the household income while also taking\ncare of the young, theelderly and the sick mean they have the longest days, the shortest rest and the\nhighest stress, making them easy targets of disease.\nContainment measures and their economic fallout are likely to hurt more than the disease itself, and for\nlonger. Restrictions on movement and market access will affect many households# income and coping\nstrategies in Somalia/land, including households who were relatively well off before the pandemic.

        "description": "In this part of the world where displacement and utmost poverty are prevalent with no properly\nfunctioning health systems, it is hard to imagine how adversely impactful a COVID-19 outbreak will be.\nPeople are already extremely vulnerable to bear yet another distressing crisis. While all countries need to\nrespond to COVID-19, countries with existing humanitarian crisis coupled with weak governance are\nparticularly vulnerable. When COVID-19 affects countries with protracted humanitarian crises like\nSomalia/land, vulnerable populations, particularly women headed households, the disabled and the\nelderly living in overcrowded camps or informal urban settlements will be highly vulnerable to the disease\nand its social and economic impacts unless support is given on preventative measures.The number of\npeople in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia, around 5.2 million currently, will likely sharply\nincrease in the event of COVID-19 outbreak making the already fragile situation much worse. The Locust\ninfestation is another evolving crisis andif not addressed will also have significant impact on the food\nsecurity and livelihoods of the people.\nCOVID-19 crisis will have a different and far-reaching impact on poor people, especially the vulnerable.\nAnyone can be exposed to the virus but the poor are most vulnerable as they lack financial and social\nprotections. Overcrowded IDP settlements and poor urban slums are also going to be the places where\ndisease can spread easily and quickly. To effectively address the urgent and acute humanitarian dimension\nof the crisis, we need to frame that within our understanding of how inequality plays out. Women will be\nas susceptible to getting infected by the virus but their need for support is greater because, as in any crisis,\nwomen including elderly women, bear the greater responsibility of caring for the family and making both\nends meet. Women#s multiple burdens of needing to contribute to the household income while also taking\ncare of the young, theelderly and the sick mean they have the longest days, the shortest rest and the\nhighest stress, making them easy targets of disease.\nContainment measures and their economic fallout are likely to hurt more than the disease itself, and for\nlonger. Restrictions on movement and market access will affect many households# income and coping\nstrategies in Somalia/land, including households who were relatively well off before the pandemic. As well\nas short term support we need to consider howto provide support to those affected over the longer term.",

        "description": "# Solarization of two existing water sources   in Baki and Saylac districts of Awdal benefiting more than 10,000 people and their livestock. Awdal is one of the regions affected by COVID19 as it connects Somaliland to Djibouti. The majority of people are dependent pity trades, small scale irrigation, and livestock, most of these activities have been affected, and communities reported a reduction of income. Existing water supply sources are mainly powered by a diesel generator that are purchased from the tariffs collected from the users. Associated water tariffs are sky rocking as access to diesel has reduced as restrictions are imposed on public transport. Out of the many strategic water sources, two sources are selected, supplying water for villages affected by COVID19 in Somaliland. Oxfam will install a solar system for these wells, and the action will reduce the cost of water tariff and increase community use of water for different purposes include handwashing.\n# Build the capacity of the WASH committees managing the solarizedse water sources by providing necessary tools and training them on both technical skill and financial management. This action will be led by the ministry of water department of scheme management. As we mobilize for the two sources an additional two boreholes within the sameareas will also be invited for the training. These will help to maximize use of expert time, cover nearby villages with capacity building plan and increase value for money by targeting more with same budget.\n# Support Somaliland Ministry of Water Development to ministry of water to finalize   the design and construction for WASH facilities to be shared with all WASH Cluster members in Somaliland. The national WASH cluster has prioritized this action as per the request from ministry and Oxfam will contribute for this action. The budget will be used to cover some of the consultancy fees or provide expertise to help them finalize the work.\n# Provide safeprogramming training for WaSH committees, district administrations, women groups other key stakeholders including traditional leaders    .\n# Protection awareness raising including community discussions on protection impact to address stigma and promotion of the call centre hotline   (already operational) to increase access to covid19 services for affected communities    .\n# Government capacity building/strengthen social safety net system in Somaliland : we will build the capacity of the government to be able to lead and coordinate Somaliland safety net program. Somalia launched safety net project called bahnano at Mogadishu but this has not been cascaded to Somaliland and Puntland. The government staff responsible for this are unable to run safety net due to their limited capacity. The project will target technical staff from the government and create enabling environment in the form of institutional capacity building including training of key staff, support implementation of beneficiaries selection and running coordination mechanisms smoothly.  Oxfam Somalia is implementing social safety net activity under GFFO top up. Under this activity the project aims improving supports to HHs in urban areas particularly COVID19 affected poorest or most vulnerable to prevent them to fall to poverty and destitution trap, manage COVID19 economic and social shocks and advance their lives <(>&<)> livelihoods. The government capacity in Somaliland on social safety net is to grow and as part of appeal fund, Oxfam will contribute to strengthening/establishing social protection system that leads COVID19 response project. Oxfam will partner with Somaliland Ministry of Employment, Social and Family as socialprotection responsible government body. Somaliland government capacity is yet to grow and this project will address this gap while also coordinating with other implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to be able to lead social assistance and provide at scale in the future to its society as a right. The project creates an opportunity for governments to become the standard responders to large scale crises.",

        "description": "Harhub in partnership with Oxfam is launching a social innovation challenge to tackle most pressing social issues. The partners areaiming to harness the innovations of young people in Somaliland and beyond particularly social entrepreneurs, developers, changemakers, and health practitioners keen on bringing game-changing solutions to most vital social challenges focusing on in the areas of agriculture, technology, SDGs, health, food, education, and energy. The partners believe that tackling these complex issues will require diverse skill sets, backgrounds, effort and innovation. Harhub will be prioritizing innovations which may already be proven but will reach new heights of interest within the industry given the right support from Harhub, or innovations which are new ideas and concepts, but might need some tuning to fit the requirements of potential customers.\nThrough a competitive process, Harhub will reachout to 10k youth through social media promotions to apply the program for three weeks. Harhub is expected to receive quite big and competitive projects. Whilst applicants are ongoing, Harhub will create mentors\u2019 criteria and hire 3 mentors to lead selection and the Bootcamp. All the submitted projects will be evaluated by the mentors based on the solutions\u2019 unique value proposition, social impact, visibility, technical viability, and the individuals\u2019/teams\u2019 ability and capability to scale the solution.\n\nIn total, the mentors will then select twenty most advanced and innovative projects to attendthe two full days Bootcamp to be held at Harhub. The Bootcamp will be a high-energy workshop focused on rapid ideation, refinement, and prototyping of solutions. It is a space to generate, iterate on, and test ideas for social impact, foster a culture ofinnovation through experimentation, collaboration, and expand a community of social impact innovators. In the final event, twenty finalists will pitch their solutions for a chance to win grant funding, incubation, and mentorship scheme. The top three projects will be awarded a grant fund to their projects at Harhub with all support of providing free incubation and mentorship to develop, validate, execute and scale their solutions",

According to Somaliland\u2019s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, UNDP and the World Bank reports, over 70% of Somaliland\u2019s population is under the age of 30. The unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 30 is 67% - one of the highest rates in the world. Among young women, it is even estimated at 74%. Youth in Somaliland are not just the future ofthe country, they are also the majority.\nWith 67% of the youth being out of work, the high unemployment rate forthe youth remains abig challenge in Somaliland, and this rate is even higher for young women. The unemployment rate for young women in the country is estimated to be 74%. Due to the insecurity over the last two decade and stagnant economic growth, jobs have not been created at a rate that is able to match the growth of the youth population.\nWomen often face stiff competition during business pitching/competitions and often shy away to compete with their fellow men or observe stigmatization. This conceptwill bridge this gap by specifically earmarking this Women in Tech competition for young women tech savvies to compete among each other.\nTo achieve a long lasting and sustainable economic and social transformation in the country, we must empower young women, create opportunities for prosperity and provide them with the necessary tools and resources.\nHence Innovate Ventures (IV) in partnership and collaboration with Oxfam aim to support, accelerate and grow the Somali women startup scene and accelerate the growth of women startups in technology to help them create employment opportunities, and improve the investment climate in the country",

Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises.

This intervention forms approximately 70% of the total cash transfer programming under Oxfam\u2019s overall response and will be implemented directly by Oxfam by engaging electronic financial service provider in Puntland via mobile phones. Beneficiarieswho don\u2019t possess Sim-cards will receive them as part of this response and be trained on its usage. The overall Oxfam food securityintervention which this contributes towards will include additional emergency livelihoods and recovery elements including cash for work interventions to rebuild destroyed feeder roads.Oxfam targets households that meet the critical food insecurity criteria takingintoconsideration gender-differentiated needs. The selection criteria will be discussed with thetarget women, men, boys and girls toensure fairness of the selection process. Usually, women are registered as beneficiaries and the head of the household for cash transfers. At times we find that some polygamous households are includedduring registration stage and this is addressed during verification, ensuring that the most vulnerable HH are Commented [AC12]: In addition to these activities DEC funds can also be used to coverany hygiene promotion activities/hygiene kits, COVID messaging, PPE for staffif needed?Commented [MH13R12]: We Have some PPE in thefield, Moses to add purchase of some PPE in the budget\ntargeted, in collaboration with community leaders. Female-headed households are the most affected as they do not have access to meaningful household assets such as livestock, or other sources of income. In Bari region, priorities for livelihood regeneration activities are different for women and men. Oxfam will deliver emergency food security interventions through cash grants for the most vulnerable people, while supporting household income by strengtheningand diversifying livelihoods through other projects. Oxfam's programming since March 2017 has successfully diversified the source of livelihoods in traditional pastoralist communities in Somaliland with plansto replicate this expereicnce in Puntland. This intervention will help vulnerable households to have some disposable income which they can use to purchase or meet their household food needs.Most vulnerable community members that will be most in need of the emergency assistance through this action will be identified through participatory mapping exercises conducted at village level through specific exercises including well-being rankings, vulnerability mapping, food consumption score, household purchasing power, among others. Gender will be consideredwhen selecting households to help reduce the additional burden on women headedhouseholds. The criteria shall be clearly explained to the selection committee/panel prior toselection, with clearcommunication on what beneficiaries will be entitled to during the project, to avoid unrealistic expectations.",

        "title": "CO-Drought & Sever Water Shortages Respo",
        "description": "2020 was one of the hardest years for Somalia in decades. Flooding, COVID-19 and recurring locust invasions heavily impacted on theeconomy and livelihoods of people. The government implemented measures to contain COVID-19, including the closure of schools, reduction of movement and other economic activities. The coastal areas of Puntland and Somaliland were also hit by cyclone Gati in November 2020, resulting in a sharp increase in humanitarian needs which many organizations - including Oxfam Somalia - responded to. While the performance of the 2020 Gu rain was near normal, the Deyr rain of 2020 has been categorized a complete failure due to the La Nina conditions. These developments triggered severe water shortages in many regions and districts in Somalia. Since October 2020, regional administrations, communities and other humanitarian agencies have been sending alerts about looming drought conditions in many parts of Somalia.Oxfam\u2019s feedback hotline continues to receive a high number of calls from people requesting immediate water interventions. These callers are mainly from the Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions. UNOCHA assessment findings indicate that over 50% of the communities in the assessed locations reported displacement of people due to water shortages, 85% raised major concerns on watershortages, and 14 out of 40 villages reported an increase in diarrheal cases. The price of water has already more than doubled. According to Oxfam\u2019s own market assessment, one barrel of water is currently being sold at an average of USD 4.5 per barrel, with some villages reporting over USD 7 per barrel. This is forcing the most vulnerable households to travel long distances to fetch water and/or opt for poor water quality and risk their lives. The most affected communities include IDPs and low-income host communities. Women and girls are at risk of protection-related risks as they travel in search of water.\nRegarding COVID-19, over 4,784 cases with over 130 fatalities were registered by the WHO in Somalia since the start of the pandemic, with many cases left undetected due to asymptomatic infections, low testing capacity and the stigmatisation of COVID-19 cases among the population. The second wave of the pandemic seems to have also hit the country as the number of cases started to increase in the last few months. The government of Somaliahas eased most of the restrictions in August 2020 and most of the public services have resumed. This increases the risk of vulnerability to COVID-19 and the shortages of water in many areas further restrict the communities' ability to frequently wash their hands with soap. This might create a favourable environment for COVID-19 to spread.\nThe Ministry of Water Development in Somaliland shareda request with all humanitarian agencies, indicating that over 196,848 people are in need of urgent water interventions and that many others also require quick rehabilitations of their water sources. Over 88% of the people in need are from the Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer regions of Eastern Somaliland. In October 2020, Oxfam using the ECHO crisis modifier budget reached the most vulnerable 1,800 HH (10,800 people) in Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer for 30 days with WASH interventions. Since then, we have continued to advocate for urgent interventions by sharing summary reports with the Somalia WASH cluster and presentations of the situation with cluster members. Utilising other existing resources, we are also working with the Ministry of Water Resources to rehabilitate boreholes that were identified as strategic wells by the government.",

        "description": "The first component is aimed at capacity building. At least 40 beneficiaries (at least 30% female) including fishermen and women, fishmongers will undergo a maximum of six months theoretical and practical training. Youth fishermen and women will be trained on safety at sea, fishing gear mending and repairs, safe fishing methods and fish preservation, cooperatives establishment and fish quality assurance. Fishmongers, who will mostly be women, will be trained in various topics including fish handling and preservation, fishprocessing, personal hygiene, value addition (processing, grading, and packaging) and small business management. Entrepreneurship will be an integral part of the courses in order to leverage the entrepreneurship capacity\nThe second component is aimed at supporting the establishment/ strengthening of fishery organizations. The target beneficiaries will be organized in Self Help Groups (SHGs). The SHG is a rights-based approach which views poverty as the denial of rights and poverty alleviation as a process of reclaiming one\u2019s rights. Given the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the SHG Approach puts equal emphasis on the goals of economic, social andpolitical empowerment . Therefore, the established/strengthened SHGs will have the potential to empower small-scale fishers againstsome of the environmental and socioeconomic shocks such as fish catch shortfalls and revenues, sickness and death in their families, natural disasters and hunger. The 30 young fishermen will be organized intoat least 5 SHGs and will be trained/ oriented on the operations of the SHGs\nThe third component will support the distribution of fishing kits/gear to the SHGs including women fishmongers.Midway through the training, the project beneficiaries will be provided with fishing gears in their SGHs. Such gear may include boats and other necessary tools. On the other hand, women fishmongers, will have business start-up kits including refrigerators and basic fish processing tools. The fishing kits/ gear will be owned and managed jointly in the SHGs.\nThe fourth component will focus on learning and knowledge management through value chain research. In order to ensure systematic market mapping in the fishing sector, understand actors, market share, capacity gaps, and other relevant value chain information, the project will undertake a robust research on fish value chain. The research will aim to bring out suitable models to link small holders to input and output markets and improve the benefits that fishermen and women and other resource-poor value chain actors derive from the chain. Knowledge generated from the research will be disseminated to different relevant stakeholders in the sector. It will also act as a building block for future scaling efforts of the project. As Oxfam and the partner have both long-term livelihood strategies, the research finding would beused for future programing.",

It's evident that the Humanitarian Aid Dependency has largely affected the productivity of the Somali population. However, there's need to exhaust to what extent these will be addressed by our research questions for the Participatory Action Research (PAR) on Aid Humanitarian Aid dependency.\nIn 2019, nine Somali NGOs founded the Nexus platform that aims to shape the future in Somalia and Somaliland, by creating an enabling environment for Somali NGOs to have a leading role in the humanitarian system that puts the agency and self-reliance of communities at the center, through delivering a combination of Humanitarian Aid, Development, and Peace interventions. The Nexus coalition is led by nine Somali NGOs \u2013 African Development Solutions (ADESO), Centre for Peace and Democracy (CPD), Gargaar Relief and Development Organization (GREDO), Horn of Africa Voluntary Youth Committee (HAVOYOCO), KAALO, Save Somali Women and Children (SSWC), Social-Life and Agriculture Development Organisation (SADO), Taakulo Somaliland Community (TASCO), and WASDA. Two INGOs \u2013 Oxfam and Save the Children International were invited to join as international partners to support with critical investments.\nSo far the platform developed and applied its strategy andtheory of change whilst Humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, Somalia Nexus consortium aims to focus interventions that are in line with its pillars, including Community-driven and working across the Triple Nexusof Development, Humanitarian Aid, Peace-building and conflict-resolution, as well as strengthening the capacity of Somali Civil Society <(>&<)> Government institutions. In addition, special considerations will be given concerning practicality and implementation methodology including presence, scaleof the need, duration and coordination with other stakeholders.\nThe day-to-day activities of theplatform are performed by the Secretariat supported by the Steering committee who are also responsible for resource mobilization, organizing coordination meetings, fund management and drafting policies and guidelines\nIn 2021, the Nexus platform aims to implement efforts to support its members and government institutions in both Somalia and Somaliland, through development of Community-driven Development manuals, conducting Participatory Action Research that finds durable solutions on climate related challenges in both pastoral and agro-pastoral communities, conducting PAR that aims to address the level and scope of dependency created by Unconditional Cash disbursement to local rural communities as well as supporting Somalia and Somaliland governments to develop standardized Cash Transfer model with clear guidelines.\nSocial inclusion, protection and Covid-19 protocols will be maintained and mainstreamed in project interventions.",

        "description": "Oxfam\u2019s commitment is to actively centre the voice and experience of people and community in all our work and consider power, privilege and equity in the design of community-based feedback and complaints mechanisms CBFCMS, and to respect the knowledge, wisdom andperspective of others, as there is always scope for Oxfam to grow and learn as an organisation working with communities.\nFunctionalfeedback and complaints mechanisms that are accessible and safe to use are a demonstration of our organization-wide accountability commitment, to be truly accountable to the people and communities we work with and those affected by our programmes, by ensuring that they understand what is appropriate and inappropriate conduct of our staff and partners, getting their feedback about our programmes and/or complaints about conduct of our staff, agents or partners  and taking appropriate action to address these concerns. Accountability is \u201cthe process of using power responsibly, taking account of, and being held accountable by different stakeholders, and primarily those who are affected by the exercise of such power\u201d . It is the right to be heard, and the duty to respond.\n\nHowever, anecdotal information indicates that where CBFCMs initiatives and experiences exist in Oxfam, many are still disjointed, some are uncoordinated, and largely undocumented. In many places, they are non-existent, or if they are, not all of them are fully functional. The design of Oxfam\u2019s CBFCMs by Affiliates, Country Offices and in part Partners has not always ensured community involvement, in most cases resulting in not fit for purpose mechanisms. Also different affiliates still approach the issue of CBFCMs differently with different emphasis, approaches, tools and resources, therefore lacking a standardised coordinated approach.\n\nAlthough Oxfam prides itself for encouraging communities we work with to speak out and report PSEA and child protection concerns and incidents concerning them,recent reports in some countries like DRC, Ethiopia, and Uganda not only attests to the limited awareness at community level on SEAand child protection risks and reporting mechanisms, but has also led to an increase in attention to ensure that SEA and child abuse and exploitation by humanitarian and development organisations like Oxfam are addressed through investment in preventive approaches but also responding to reports of abuse and exploitation when these incidents are reported.\nOxfam has two responsibilities for accountability in the programmes it manages, holding a responsibility for mutual accountability with its partners (as do the partners) and also holding a shared or joint accountability (with its partners) to the communities affected by its programmes. There is lack of knowledge how the\nIn addition to some of the above challenges, COVID-19 has added additional challenges to how effective current CBFCMs are, placing additional barriers to reporting that are currently not fully understood or risks mitigated.\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:\n1. Map out existing CBCM\u2019s initiatives in select field/project locations, and document best practices and lessons learnt in implementing CBFCMs across the Oxfam confederation\n2. Undertake a rapid assessment of the existing CBFCMs in Oxfam terms of effectiveness, experiences and lessons plus existing gaps.",

        "description": "The eastern regions in Somaliland and especially Saanag and Sool regions continue to suffer from recurrent drought. This situation has increased the vulnerability of the communities as they have lost most of their livestock which was their main source oflivelihood. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two regions also continue to experience occasional inter clan fighting which isoften triggered by competition for available pasture and water resources. Drilling of the a boreholes will not only contribute to providing important water sources that can support the water needs of the communities during drought and harsh climatic conditions, but also contribute to reducing risk factors leading to conflict. It will offer an opportunity to the benefiting communities to have a chance for better access to potable water, reduce the incidents water related diseases and increase access for water for practicing frequent handwashing to prevent COVID-19.\nObjectives;\n\u2022 Provide sustainable water source for 5000 people and over 10,000 livestockheads in Sanaag Region.\nGroundwater Feasibility Study:\nA groundwater feasibility study will be conducted in three selected villagesof Sanaag region. the study will follow three approach method,\n1. Remote Sensing: Desk review using latest satellite imageries to selected best possible locations. This phase will focus on finding regional fractures carrying water from highland of Ethiopia to thelowland of Sanaag regions and from Sanaag mountains to low land areas.\n2. Geophysical Study: ground truthing work will be conducting using latest start of art geophysical technology at least three locations with spacing of 1000 -1500m. This location are those selected in first phase of the study work. Government and community engagement will be conducted to understand the local geology, possible impact of drilling on environment and stability of the communities.\nDrilling of the borehole\nBased on the groundwater feasibility study, the drilling work will be advertised through the local media. In order to avoid failures resulted from improper use of drilling equipment and selection of drilling method, the contractor will receive full copy of the study report and will be given a briefing on the drilling technology and technique recommended by the study team. Then, a payment by result approach will be used to contract drilling companies i.e. Oxfam/Taakulo will only pay if the borehole has water with discharge of above 2liter per second. Failureto get a contractor willing to commence drilling with such conduction, further meeting will be help between Oxfam and Taakulo to discuss best possible approach to increase value for money.\nSupervision and Monitoring:\nIn drilling works supervision and monitoring progress is critical step. Oxfam/Taakulo will have a site supervisor equipped with necessary materials for supervision including TDS Sensor to record water quality at each 1 meter, mud funnel to record the drilling mud viscosity and deeper to follow the depth of the drilling. The supervisor will provide daily update to both Oxfam/Taakulo team and will ensure all decision that affect drilling performance is consulted and agreed before action. TDS level will be recorded in monitoring tool provided and the result will be used for deciding the borehole casing arrangement. All materials that will be used for drilling will be inspected by the drilling supervisor and approve. In case a specialized chemical will be used for the drilling; the supervisor will request for all safety related certificate prior use of such chemicals.\nPost Drilling Construction:\nThis action will be decided right after the drilling is completed. Provision of submersible pump with cable and riser pipes, and construction of generator house, water distribution system for both animal and human and storage facilities will be included under this phase. Other grants, including ECHO 2021 and/or other internal grants will be used to finance this critical activity. Incase the borehole salinity is above an acceptable regional level i.e. 2500ppm, provision of desalination unit will be considered.",

Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Cares Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results show\n that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health care\n for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that \neventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneousl\ny invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the \ntelephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified.

The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

        "title": "Fighting TB in Somalia: public-private partnerships and inclusive communities",
        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB)  especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: d\nisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat  fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is th\ne low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case detect\nion rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and prisone\nrs)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of Soma\nliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of tu\nberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease stigm\na/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tubercul\nosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",
